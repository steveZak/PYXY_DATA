        "wiki": "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum (Chinese: \u4e2d\u5c71\u9675; pinyin: Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n L\u00edng) is situated at the foot of the second peak of Purple Mountain in Nanjing, China. Construction of the tomb started in January 1926, and was finished in spring of 1929. The architect was L\u00fc Yanzhi, who died shortly after it was finished. His representative and project partner was his close friend Huang Tanpu.\n\n\n== History ==\nSun Yat-sen Mausoleum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nDr. Sun was born in Guangdong province of China on 12 November 1866, and died in 1925 in Beijing, China. On 23 April 1929, the Chinese government appointed He Yingqin to be in charge of laying Dr. Sun to rest. On 26 May, the coffin departed from Beijing, and on 28 May, it arrived in Nanjing. On 1 June 1929, Dr. Sun was buried there. Sun, considered to be the \"Father of Modern China\" both in mainland China and in Taiwan, fought against the imperial Qing government and after the 1911 revolution ended the monarchy, and founded the Republic of China.\n\n\n=== Selection of the design ===\nA committee decided to host a design competition in order to collect designs for the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The committee put advertisements in the newspapers on 5 May 1925, inviting architects and designers at home and abroad to send their designs. In exchange for a 10 yuan charge, the committee would provide the designer with 12 pictures of the site. The design would have to adhere to guidelines. It had to be done in a traditional Chinese style that also evoked a modern design with special and memorial substance. Not only should it evoke the Chinese architectural spirit, but also add creativity. Designers were required to insure that the proposed construction costs within 300,000 yuan (the final cost exceeded 3,000,000 Yuan). Over 40 proposals were received. On 20 September 1925, the committee convened in Shanghai, and unanimously selected Lu Yanzhi's proposal.The mausoleum was designed by Lu Yanzhi and completed by Poy Gum Lee between 1926\u20131929.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nReclining on a mountain slope, the majestic mausoleum blends the styles of traditional imperial tombs and modern architecture. Lying on the mountainside, the vault is more than 700 meters (2,300 ft) away from the paifang on the square below, which is the entrance of the mausoleum. There is a three-tier stone stand on which a huge bronze ding, an ancient Chinese vessel symbolizing power, perches. To the north of the square, the paifang towers high. Beyond is the 480-meter (1,570 ft) and 50-meter (160 ft)-wide stairway which has 392 stairs leading to the vault. On both sides, pine, cypress, and ginkgo trees guard the way. At the end of the stairway is a gate which is 16 meters (52 ft) high and 27 meters (89 ft) wide. The tri-arched marble gate is inscribed with the personal motto of Dr. Sun, with four Chinese characters written by him, \"Tian Xia Wei Gong\" (\"\u5929\u4e0b\u7232\u516c\") which means \"What is under heaven is for all\". Inside the gate, there is a pavilion in which a 9-meter (30 ft) stele is set, which is a memorial monument set by the Kuomintang (KMT). A few stairs up is the sacrificial hall and the vault.\nIn front of the sacrificial hall there stands a pair of huabiao, ancient Chinese ornamental columns, which are 12.6 meters high. The sacrificial hall is actually a palace of 30 meters (98 ft) in length, 25 meters (82 ft) in width, and 29 meters (95 ft) in height. In the center of the hall a 4.6-meter (15 ft)-high statue of Dr. Sun sits. The statue was sculptured out of Italian white marble.  The hall's ceiling features the flag of the Kuomintang. Biographical information on Dr. Sun is available to visitors in the hall. North of the hall lies the bell-shaped vault, wherein lies the sarcophagus of Dr. Sun.\nArchitectural influence of the Mausoleum's design is evident in Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.\n\n\n== High profile visits ==\n\nIn a historical documentary, Chiang Kai Shek, former President of the Republic of China, officiated the opening and paid his visit to Mausoleum reporting his victory of the Northern Expedition to unify China in 1929. Chiang also made a second visit in summer of 1946 after the conclusion of the second world war to report the victory for his cause that mainland China was once again in Chinese sovereignty.On 27 April 2005, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, his wife, and other KMT members visited the Mausoleum. It was the first visit of KMT members to the site since 1949.\nOn 15 November 2006, a visit was made to the Mausoleum by Dr. Sun's granddaughter, Sun Huiying, who was by then over eighty years old.\nIn May 2008, Wu Po-hsiung became the first ruling KMT Chairman to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum since 1949. There were concerns that the 392 steps leading to the tomb would be too taxing given Wu's leg injuries.\nOn 12 February 2014, Wang Yu-chi became the first ROC government official in office to visit the site after the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.On 31 October 2016, KMT Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu visited the mausoleum during her mainland trip for the Cross-strait Peace Development Forum.\n\n\n== Modifications ==\nIn 1981, Lily Sun, a granddaughter of Sun Yat-sen, visited the mausoleum. The flag of the KMT had been removed from the ceiling at the time of her visit, but was later restored. In May 2011 on another visit, she was surprised to find the four characters \"General Rules of Meetings\" (\u6703\u8b70\u901a\u5247), a document that Sun wrote in reference to Robert's Rules of Order had been removed from a stone carving.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall\nCihu Mausoleum\nTouliao Mausoleum\nLinggu Temple and Tomb of Tan Yankai\nTomb of Lin Sen at Geleshan, Chongqing\nTomb of Liao Zhongkai and He Xiangning\nPlum Blossom Mountain in Nanjing (Former Tomb of Wang Jingwei, demolished in 1946)\nTomb of Hu Hanmin at Longyandong, Guangzhou\nWu Zhihui Memorial park in Kinmen\nTomb of Huang Xing at Yuelu Mountain\nSecond Guangzhou Uprising\nTomb of Sun Zhesheng in Yangmingshan Private Cemetery,  Beitou District, Taipei\nTomb of Yu Youren in Yangmingshan National Park, Taipei\nSun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall\nSun Yat-sen Memorial Hall\nSun Yat Sen Memorial House\nSun Yat-sen Museum Penang\nSun Yat Sen Memorial Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum national park",

          "Going to this site in a cab proved challenging, as the cab driver dropped us off a little over half way up the hill and told us that we could get a \"little train\" up to the top. We could not get on any \"little train\" or any other form of transport and we had to walk all the way",
          "It was a huge place with lots of greenery and historical buildings. The walk to the top of the Mausoleum was difficult - especially in the heat, but it was worth the view at the top!",
          "Sun Yatsen Mausoleum us a peaceful place. You can plan to visit it besides another destination (ideally \"the purple mountain\"). The place is not very big but it gives great informations about Dr Sun Yatsen.",
          "We went to see the Sun Yatsen Mausoleum during a one day trip to Nanjing. It is a bit of hike to get to the top, but the views are worth it. The building is beautiful and architectural is very detailed.",

          "If you are interested in China's history in 20th century you must be familiar with the name Sun Yatsen. Although, he was not from Nanjing he asked to be buried in the city. The mausoleum complex is quite large and requires some walking and climbing stairs, but it turned to be",
          "Lots of walking required, but well worth it. Lots of places to buy refreshments and rest. A bit crowded but very friendly people.",
          "This was a beautiful mausoleum, providing stunning views of Nanjing from the top of the massive staircase that was fun to traverse. I do wish that there was more information on the life of Dr. Sun Yatsen though and the overall impact he made to China and the world.",
          "My hosts highly recommended the place, above all other attractions in the city, and as it scores 2nd on Tripadvisor list, decided to give it a go. It is located on a shallow hill within the city, within a huge dedicated area, and as it is the resting place of the founder of the",
          "Well... it is China. So wherever you go, you can see a lot of people. However this particular place is flooded with people most of the year as is is a important place for Chinese people. There are a lot of students who are on their filed trip and lots of ordinary people who",

          "Remarkable example of the way Chinese construct a Mausoleum for the celebration of the life of past leaders. Must be in reasonably good shape to get to the mausoleum as a few km walk then 300 or 400 steps. Beuatiful parklands surround although as in all China, no wildlife at",
          "It is a sacred place to visit as it has the tomb of the most prominent pioneer/figure in China's history for democracy and freedom. The temples in the surrounding areas are also nice. So is the park itself. However, as in any other touristic places in China, you should expect",
          "I visited here in March 2017. Dr. Sun Yatsen was an extremely important figure in Chinese history and greatly revered all over China. It is a complex which includes the Sun Yatsen Burial Place and the Linggu Scenic Area. It is called Purple Mountain. I did climb up the 400",
          "Purple mountain area is a great, green and very quiet area. Lakes, trees etc. is OK however to me it is not worth to ascend 400 stairs just to see the mausoleum. You may visit if you have a lot! of time.",

          "We stopped by this part of the Zhongshan park to see the mausoleum and nice views. The steps aren't hard and the view from the top is nice. You get a bit of history about Sun YatSen. It was crowded when we went, so that made it difficult to navigate the park by the provided",
          "A must visit for travelers to Nanjing. Lots of history, stunning views from the top (outside the actual mausoleum), and a real sense of engaging with local people making a kind of pilgrimage It is well set-up for [local] tourists, with plenty of opportunities to buy food,",
          "The views are incredible from the stairs up to the mausoleum. The trees and plantings are extraordinary. Parks connect the mausoleum to the Ming Tombs and other structures. We were there when the cherry trees were in bloom and it created a magical setting. Ponds, flowers,",
          "In 2015 and 2016, we went to this mausoleum. We only walked up to the archway and to the gate because they close it every Monday for maintenance. This year our tour group changed the plan to visited Nanjing first. On that beautiful sunny day, we climbed up 392 steps all the way",
          "We we t to see the mausoleum following a guide book recommendation. The walk up is picturesque and the views from the mausoleum are fantastic. It is very very busy, we went on a Wednesday outside of holiday time and it was heaving, but this is china! The Mausoleum itself is not",
          "This park is massive and encompasses quite a bit for a normal walking tour. This specific mausoleum is the closest you can get to from the MuXuYuan train station (Line 2). The walk up can be tiring if not prepared for it but there are transportation you can take up and down",
          "The site can easily be accessed via the metro station Xiamafang. From the metro station it's about a 30 minute walk to the mausoleum. It's uphill, but it's an easy walk. The mausoleum itself is very nice to look at and the view from the top of the steps (there are a lot of",
          "Sun Yatsen Mausoleum was a surprise. There was a lot of pollution that day and was a little bit difficult to arrive at the end of the stairs but it worth it. Anyway be careful when you pay the ticket at the entrance, the Mausoleum is free but the other things ( very interesting",

          "For me it s definitely better the location than the monument itself. The mausoleum of the first chinese president is a chance for the western guys to better understand the country and the chinese history",
          "Great travel experience, full of historic moments and interesting facts. The climb was pretty tough though-293 steps. Would recommend to people who like exploring but not to the elderly who have aching bodies.",
          "Nothing much to look at. 3 degrees cold and nice cloudy view from the top , not much of a challenge climbing up. Hardly broke a sweat .",
          "Immense park, which can probably best be visited in spring or fall. Lots of things to see and interesting for people interested in some of Chinese history",
          "I was there with a friend before a business visit. It is a very intersting place, since you experience both, the Chinese landscape in this area plus an impression about Chinese history.",
          "Beautiful and historical place to visit. You can walk up to the site but we opt and were glad to pay more for the shuttle. After you arrive at the site, there is more climbing to reach the mausoleum. When you arrive at the top, pay your respect to Sun Yatsen and then walk",
          "Spent several hours at this site and a full day would be possible as there is much to see. There are several historical sites to visit and not just the Sun Mausoleum and all are worthy of a hour or two. It is a large site so try and take the transport services offered they are",
          "Accessed this monument via the overpriced shuttle buses that you need to get around the whole park area. The walk has a wonderful view, both up and down the steps. Unfortunately, you cannot take photos inside. Note that food near the monument is mostly overpriced snacks (that",

          "Visiting the site with a 10yo kid, iwas a little sceptical about making it to the top, but we made it quite easily. You don't need torush, take your time. The view is indeed spectacular, taking into account that the surrounding area is quite flat. We got half/lucky because it",
          "Walked up 390 steps to see Dr. Sun's statue to pay the tribute. As this is the place where Dr. Sun is buried. If you want to learn more about Dr. Sun, you could visit President resident in Nanjing or Dr. Sun's memorial in Taipei. It's convenient to visit mausoleum. There",
          "Really enjoyed our hike up to the top, beautiful scenery and views. Lots of people even mid week made one realise how special this place is. Enjoyed using our selfy-stick for filming those panoramic views.",
          "First of all, save your time and hop on one of the tourist cars that takes you from the entrance to the Mausoleum. You'll need this for exploring beautiful park around. I'll be honest there is nothing to see in the mausoleum itself - only sculpture of Sun Yatsen, but the view",
          "Large grounds and well maintained. The mausoleum was a disappointment to be honest after the long tedious climb up. Expected more but on the whole nice open grounds. Be prepared to walk and climb.",

          "The memorial, which is easy to get to by subway, is set in great parkland which makes a good break from the city. It is a steep climb up steps to the top but worth it with great views.",
          "We hired a cab to take us to this area. Then you have to walk a ways, but it's free to see the site. Make sure you wear good walking shoes because you do a lot of stair climbing! Bring water and perhaps an umbrella for shade since there's a lack of trees. It gets busy so try",
          "Went on a nice warm Saturday afternoon when the air wasn't too polluted and loved it, It is a bit of a climb going up I think it's 392 steps but when you get up there, the view in nice. Definitely a must see while in Nanjing.",
          "getting there is easy, there is a tourist bus available to get you near the Mausoleum and a buggy to get you back to the metro station. Not to mention the amazing view from the top. I went there a day after it snowed in Nanjing. Beautiful and very well taken care of. And it's",
          "The entire area is full of steps that you need to climb, but the actual mausoleum was just a small room that can be cleared in 10 minutes, a far cry from the Sun Yat Sen memorial in Taipei. People who find climbing steps a chore may want to give this a miss.",
          "This site is the perfect example of Chinese grandeur. The Mausoleum is a monument to the father of modern China, the first president Dr Sun Yet-sen. Situated on the side of Purple Mountain, the Mausoleum is the perfect vantage point to see views of the city. I visited in",
          "Impressive, grandiose memorial in honour of the father of modern China. The views are great from the top. But not a very informative experience - would've been nice if they provided a bit more information about the life of the great man. Also, expect ridiculous amounts of",
          "This is near the Ming mausoleum and is about 900 m away. Sun Yatsen mausoleum is up on a hill. Be prepared to walk up hundreds of steps to the mausoleum but it is worth it. The view is great. There are other site attractions, shops and food around.",
          "I was there twice. The Mausoleum is very impressive. On my opinion, China people cherish Sun Yatsen first of all as the really democratic leader.",
          "Sun Yatsen Mausoleum has a special place in the history of china. It is a must visit place in Nanjing where you will surely get to know about the historical importance of Sun Yat Sen and since the mausoleum in located in the top, you will enjoy a beautiful view of the city",
          "This is where the Father of the Nation (of modern China) is laid to rest. For that alone, a definite must. But in the context of joining many Chinese on a journey up many steps up a hillside to the mausoleum, a definite must. There is no cost but for the calories you expend",
          "head over here from Linggu Scenic Area (Line 4). didnt get to see the marble sarcophagus as the door was closed, but no regret climbing up the stairs.",
          "There is a lot of history on your way up to the Mausoleum, but even if you aren't into the history of it, this location offers the best view of the city. It is a bit of a walk up the stairs, but it is well worth it. I would recommend taking one of the trams up there instead of",
          "I visited Dr Sun Yat Sen's mausoleum on a solo day trip to nanjing in October. This is located in the Zhongshan mountain park area so is lush green and the weather pleasant. There is a toy train that takes you up from the taxi stand to the foot of the monument. There are 300 odd",
          "A very long walk uphill to the first buildings, we had driven through a large park with many big trees, a long winding road before we reached the carpark, pity the sun didn't appear, the trees on either side of the wide path were held in a sort of scaffold, it seems a few years",
          "Very busy with tourists, and it definitely wasn't peak season. Over 300 steps to top and then again back down, but quite manageable. Absolutely beautiful both the landscape, scenery and architecture. Not much (if any) information on the life of Dr Sun Yatsen so make sure to do",
          "Respect the national hero of China. However, in order to see his mausoleum, you have to be in relatively good condition, because you will get tired of the long stairs. The admission is free to the Mausoleum, do not miss it for the sake of the panorama.",

          "The purple mountain is worth every minute you can find. The climb to the Mausoleum includes a lot of stairs, and the Mausoleum itself isn't that interesting.",
          "Visited the Purple Mountain for a lovely day out. Climbed up to the mausoleum no problem and saw amazing views! We also walked up to the peak with even better views of Nanjing. We run into a bit of trouble when we went off the main steps to try and find the peak. We picked up",

          "Take the tourist tram for 10 RMB and your feet will thank you later, even if this is the only site you visit in the Purple Mountain. We walked to the tomb from the MRT station. After spending an hour there, we took a tram ride to the Mausoleum. The tram dropped us off at the",

          "I wasn't expecting such a big mausoleum of the nationalist era to endure in mainland China - after historical events such as the Cultural Revolution. However, the Sun Yatsen Mausoleum is still there, in all its greatness, enjoyable for free. Make your way through the crowds",
          "Nice surroundings, in a very large park, with a lot of places to see. Many spots to have a fast lunch or snacks. If planning to see all sites, must spend a full day. If only one or two spots, half a day is enough. Be prepared to walk, although not a hard hiking.",
          "If you are reasonably well-read on China's history, then this is just one of those places that you need to tick off while travelling in China. The setting is excellent and really enhances the visit - situated within a very large, hilly, well-maintained parklands area, with",
          "Nice place but overcrowded. No traffic inside of the attraction. More than 2km from the metro. Sightseeing bus is not sufficient for the crowd so I had to take the expensive taxi for this 2km. A lot of stairs to climb, inside only a sculpture. The blue-sky-white-sun flag inside",
          "It is a climb to the mausoleum which is simple but appropriate. They ask that no pictures are taken, but one can slip one in without flash. The climb is long but the view of Nanji g is magnificen as well as the gardens of the park below",
          "I personally am not much of an athlete. I'm a foodie & a shopaholic (so keep that in mind as you read ahead). Pros: + Guide: If you have a good guide, he/she can speak to the rich history and symbolism associated with this Mausoleum. Because Sun Yatsen married a Japanese",
          "Worth the walk, worth the crowds, worth the stair climb! The views on a great day are amazing and even on a cloudy day a little surreal. If you can head up there when it opens (8.30am) beat the crowds, although you will miss the people watching which is also part of the",

          "First up, Trip Advisor is slightly confused. Purple Mountain, the Sun Yat Sen Mausoleum and the Sun Yat Sen Memorial are all listed separately. Don't be fooled, they are all the same place that you can visit in one trip. Bring your walking shoes though, because there is",

          "This my first trip to Nanjing and I was so glad to have included this attraction. I loved the scenic walk from the bottom of the mountain to the top. At the top was the mausoleum and the views were amazing, even on a rainy day! Had the weather been nice and dry, I could have",
          "The places is very well organized (signa, etc). Very impressive park and monument. We encountered heavy rain so were unable to fullt appreciate the place, but it was still very impressive. Albeit the rain, the place was very crowded.",
          "The place is fairly clean and interesting if you are into the modern history of China. It was nice to walk around the area and learn about how Nanjing was the capital before retreat of the Nationalists. Since Nanjing is very hot and humid in the summer, so try not to visit",

          "This is right in the middle of a great park. This is one of the thing anyone visiting should do. The climb up to the mausoleum is really part of the pilgrimage. The view from the top (on a clear day) is beautiful. Very well located for access and a good escape from the city.",
          "Dr. Sun Yat Sen is considered by many to be be father of modern China. People make pilgrimages to his Mausoleum memorial in Nanjing. We made a day trip on the bullet train from Shanghai to visit. It was hotter than anyplace I'd ever been on the day we visited, and climbing",
          "This place gave us a great impression when we visited 15 years ago. Dr. Sun Yat-sen chose this majestic mountain range where his mausoleum was built. When you walk through the archway in 375 meters is the gate. We walked up 392 steps and 10 terraces in between all the way up to",
          "We visited this as part of our all inclusive trips package aboard the Victoria Sophia Yangtze cruise ship which docked nearby and although quite nice I'm sure it meant more to the Chinese people than tourists from outside China. In general it was very busy and after climbing",
          "Unfortunately, you have to go here because of its historical significance and the view (if the sky is clear). However, it's so darn crowded!",

          "Wow. I loved it, gathered enough souvenirs for a small army, took a few pictures here and there, survived the bus ride after missing it 10 times and said ni hao to everyone under 2-feet tall. I will return to climb the stairs of Purple Mountain one more time. To the top!",
          "We took the subway to the Muxuyuan station. The subway was clean, fast, and cheap. We walked to the tourist station The tourist station is 300 meters north of the Muxuyuan station and is near the overpass. We paid CNY 10 for one way ticket for the tourist bus to Dr. Sun Yat-sent",
          "Yes, there's a nice statue at the top and the view is pretty lovely. But the truth is that I was disappointed. I heard there were other rooms in the mausoleum but they must have been closed when I was there. There really wasn't much to see. If you're in the area, you might as",

          "I never went inside of the buildings, but the exteriors were unique with the blue roofs and non-bedazzled look of the simple decor. Very astute looking. The huge pine tree line leading up to the top is also fantastically beautiful. When you get near the top, where the city of",
          "The sit in-and-of itself is a bit underwhelming, much like Mao's tomb I suppose, but the atmosphere is serene and the architecture grandiose. Add to it the fact that this is the mausoleum of one of the most important figures in modern Chinese history, it is FREE, and Nanjing is",
          "but very worthwhile. The memorial and the surrounding area are very impressive. Useful to brush up on your history before the visit to appreciate the importance of this man.",
          "After climbing 400 stairs all you get to see is a huge statue of Dr. Sun. You are not even allowed to take photos inside. The best thing is the beautiful scenery from the top. Not worth the effort. Try to take a taxi or bus before reaching the main entrance otherwise it will be",
          "I went there in late November, the weather is cold, but went I climb up there, I was sweaty because so many steps. Can't image if you go there in Summer. It's crowded, the view is soso, but the most important thing to come here is to learn about the history.",
          "So many tourist here. If you don't know any thing about Dr. Sun Yat-San, you may skip this place. There is no any explaination here. However, it is still a good place to see the city from hill top.",
          "Sun Yatsen is the father of modern China. Both the Nationalist and Communist claim to be heir to Sun Yatsen. The visit to the Sun Yatsen Mausoleum may take about 2 hours and overlooks modern Nanjing. Unless one takes time to read modern Chinese history, the revered Sun Yatsen",
          "I visited this attraction on a winter afternoon and despite countless trees were without leaves, the view was simply spellbinding. There are 396 steps to climb but it's easily done in 20 minutes. The view of the hills and Nanjing city are worth the climb.",
          "Be warned, if you catch the subway out to the memorial it is quite a walk (mostly uphill) to the Mausoleum. Having said that, it was worth the effort. There are many options for breaking up the journey, from touristy shops and the ubiquitous McDonalds to more traditional Chinese",
          "Very helpful earpiece English language audio programme to accompany tourists. Very clean and well kept grounds and pathways. A great climb up the 300 steps to the Mausoleum which we can't enter to protect the content.",

          "It seems you have to visit this mausoleum if you are in Nanjing-they are very proud of their native son. I was confused by the lack of respect shown by the native Chinese, however. Lots of talking, shoving, picture taking in what should have been hallowed ground...",
          "It was a must visit place to pay respect to Dr. Sun given his importance and contribution to Chinese revolution. The park was very comfortable and by paying C$10, the small train took visitors directly to the beginning of the 392 staircase. Pity now the room where Dr. Sun was",

          "Sooo many people (also because it was National Week) but a great place to see nonetheless. A bit of a climb up lots of stairs also gives you an awesome view of Nanjing behind you, and the gran mausoleum ahead of you. It was a pretty special experience.",

          "We didn't spend that much time at the actual mausoleum, but the walk from the Ming Tombs entry (where we were dropped off by the taxi) towards the stairs that lead to the mausoleum was nice. Depending on the air quality, you can have a pretty decent view of a large part of",

          "Perhaos in bygone days, the higher the steps, the more grand it appears.. This however does not facilitate access, especially in peak season. The tranquility of the mausoleum is lost and the idea of trodding steps along with tonnes of others to pay respects is flawed... Not",

          "You can reach the Mausoleum which is situated on the Purple mountain by using a metro + a small car (costs 10 yuan). There were Chinese just walking up, of course, but that is definitely not the best idea. The stairs are quite big and nice. Everything is clean, lots of Chinese",
          "on mountains but close from the city center there is this mausoleum which is very interesting and nice.... you are walking on a road full of trees and flowers,with big trees and suddenly you can see the entrance...so big and so nice unfortunately when i was there the main hall",

          "We were part of a large swell of people walking up the steps to the mausoleum because it was public holiday week of the Spring Festival. The climb was steep but the view from The Purple Mountain would have been great, apart from the pollution mist over the area. At the top we",

          "It's a very impressive place to visit, it's amazing how Dr. Sun Yatsen built that... gardens are nice, and the architechture there is amazing... the only problem is that I visited that a sunday and it was full (believe me, fulllllllllll of people!) The good thing, it was for",
          "Probably one of the most important political figures and revolutionaries in China at turn of the 20th Century, he requested to be buried here although he died in Beijing. No longer access to the coffin area itself (due to the extraordinary number of tourists) nevertheless it is",
          "What you come to see here is nothing really special but there is such an atmosphere among Chinese visitors. Droves of Chinese were visiting this when I was there and quite a few wanted me in photographs with them (sadly this has not happened to me elsewhere in Nanjing!). Clearly",
          "This is a must visit place in Nanjing. You can visit the purple mountain and do loads of stuffs here. Kids love this place too. The only problem is that it gets very crowded during holidays. I think it will be best to visit the place and enjoy it more when there are less",

          "The view up to the mausoleum and then back down is amazing. 392 steps! Don't worry, just take your time as there's no rush. Plenty of time to stop and take it all in. If you're going to take a tripod make sure it's a very light one.",
          "In a pretty park, just be aware that there are may steps to climb, and they get steeper towards the top! Please read up on Dr. Sun Yat Sen before you go to get the historical setting. The views are fantastic (on a clear day)",

          "History aside, this place requires a long walk up the road to the mausoleum complex then a climb up to the Mausoleum itself. The view from the top is ok, if you've seen many a great view. I spent less than 1 minute in the Mausoleum itself where there sits a medium sized statue",
          "We took the electric car up the mountain from the subway station so our legs were fresh for the climb. There are lots of steps up to the mausoleum but worth it - the view is great from the top - but Sun Yat Sen is a fundamental part of Chinese history so a must-see if visiting",

          "We definitely needed more time in this area. First of all, the walk just to get to the base of the mausoleum is fair, then making your way up the many stairs. The walk to the mausoleum starts with a pleasant stroll through the woods. In Autumn, when the leaves are changing",
          "Beautiful Purple mountain, spectacular merging of environments (natural and historical)...the 392 steps to the mausoleum appropriately obliging the visitor to make an effort to be part of this monumental time and place; and then the statue of Dr Sun Yat Sen, looking out over",

          "The amount of Chinese people that come on a pilgrimage to his Mausoleum, shows the respect that they have for him and for his ideals. There are almost 400 steps to get to his final resting place and statue at the top of the hill. There are shops down the bottom and souvenir",
          "A great insight into China's history and a very pretty, manicured place to visit. Even thought the climb to the Mausoleum is steep, it is well worth it. There are plenty of shady areas in which to simply sit and reflect on this amazing country",

          "This Mausoleum is the busiest attraction within Purple Mountain. I recommend getting here earlier in the day as it get's amazingly crowded in the afternoon - since almost everyone in China goes there to pay respect to Sun Yatsen. As a westerner, the Mausoleum isn't terribly",
          "This trip is OK if you like history and to see the grave of the creator of Communist China, when I arrived the entrance was free but i saw a sign that said 90 Yuan. The stairs are more than 300 but it is an easy climb with benches on each platform to relax, the sight on the top",
          "Long flight of stairs but it's worth it. A lot of people too. Wow.... Worth it but I do not recommend being here alone. Somehow, this is one place I with the most crowd and I really mean crowd. Mostly chinese tourists (not foreigners) and there's always a line for everything.",
          "Apart from the amaying view on top of the purple mountain it has also a huge historical aspect. I don't wanna go on here about the importance of Sun Yatsen to China since you probably know all about it anyway. If you are interested in history, this is a must visit!",

          "Prepare to do a long walk, so put on your most comfortable shoes..! The park and the hill have a stunning view of great nature.. Many chinese visitors and groups of students come here, either to pay respect or just to enjoy the view. But, they lack of information written in",

          "The Mausoleum is definitely a must-visit in Nanjing. Erected on the side of a hill, the view is worth climbing the 344 stairs (we indeed counted them are cannot agree with the guide-book on the exact number :-). The park around the museum is also great , not far from the city,",
          "It's a bit odd to consider that a modern democratic president would have a mausoleum that rivals those of the Ming or Ching emperors at the height of their imperial power, and in fact this one is larger than most of them. It serves well as a huge public park, since many Chinese",
          "People with mobility problems beware as itis one of many places where there is a great deal of walking to do .",

          "A worthy resting place for the founder of the first republic. It's like putting the Lincoln Memorial on top of a hill with hundreds (yes, hundreds) of steps going up the hill. Be in decent shape if you plan on walking. There is a tram available for a nominal fee (15 yuen).",
          "This is a surprisingly large area - with many things to do and see. It was particularly beautiful in December as many of the Ginko trees leaves had turned to yellow or were falling. Many picture opportunities as well as other lovely trees. The Sacred Walk to the Ming Tomb nearby",

          "Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum is located in green countryside. Major structures made of moorstone and blue glazed tiles make them solemn and splendid. A feeling of respect to Sun generates naturally from visitors. Don't visit the place during public holidays in China.",
          "The day I visited this place there were 200000 people there, kind of ruin the supposed serious atmosphere at this place. After all, this is the burial place of the founder of the modern China. Too many tourists behaved like idiots. Maybe it would be better if I had visited it",
          "Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum is truly set in magnificent green countryside. You can get a little train (or you can walk the distance) to the base of the 392 steps (no handrails) to the Mausoleum. Then you climb - but it is not so difficult if you are unfit as you can take it",
          "This place is a must, you're visiting the tomb of the father of the Republic of China, the man who believe in three big ideals of democracy and put an end to the the millenarian monarchic rule of dinasties. Beautiful trees and a long way up, be ready to walk up tons of stairs.",
          "Crowded tourist spot and it requires a lot of ascending flights of steps but worth the views from the mausaleum at the summit. Don't try this in the heat of the summer though! Beautiful forested surroundings.",

          "Don't climb it in the summer the stairs just about did me in. There is not much to see in the building on top, it is after all only a mausoleum, however the views over Nanjing and Purple Mountain park are spectacular. Save yourself the stairs though and go to the top of the",
          "Bigger than any of the Ming/Qing emperor's tombs in Beijing. The only place in China where you see KMT's emblems proudly displayed as the rightful owner of this land. The view on top of the steps is spectacular, comparable to what you see from top of the steps of Lincoln",
          "Great trip to the legendary Purple Mountain. Take a taxi to get there, otherwise if you choose taking the subway you will walk A LOT uphill before reaching the Mausoleum, and in Nanjing climate you really want to save your energy.",

          "Compared to the other attractions in China, the Sun Yatsen Mausoleum was disappointing. The building itself is good, not impressive but if you are in Nanjing, you should visit the mausoleum. The area around the mausoleum is beautiful. The Lonely Planet mentioned that there was",

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity. The YOG aims to spread the Olympic spirit and encourage sports participation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe city is renowned for its wide variety of architectures which mainly contain buildings from multiple dynasties, the Republic of China, and the present.\n\n\n=== Imperial period ===\n\n\n==== Inside the walled city ====\nCity Wall of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u57ce\u5899)\nGate of China (Zhonghuamen; \u4e2d\u534e\u95e8)\nFuzimiao (Confucius Temple) and Qinhuai River (\u5357\u4eac\u592b\u5b50\u5e99 \u79e6\u6dee\u6cb3)\nJiangnan Examination Hall (\u6c5f\u5357\u8d21\u9662)\nZhanyuan Garden (\u77bb\u56ed)\nOld Gate East (Laomendong) (\u8001\u95e8\u4e1c)\nTaoye Ferry (\u6843\u53f6\u6e21)\nMing Palace Site (\u660e\u6545\u5bab)\nXu Garden (\u7166\u56ed)\nJiming Temple (\u9e21\u9e23\u5bfa)\nBeiji Ge (\u5317\u6781\u9601)\nDrum Tower of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u9f13\u697c)\nChaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bab)\nStone City (\u77f3\u5934\u57ce)\nYuejiang Tower (\u9605\u6c5f\u697c)\nJinghai Temple (\u9759\u6d77\u5bfa)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Outside the walled city ====\nPurple Mountain Scenic Area (\u7d2b\u91d1\u5c71)\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum and its surrounding complex (\u660e\u5b5d\u9675)\nLinggu Temple (\u7075\u8c37\u5bfa)\nXuanwu Lake (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56)\nQixia Temple (\u6816\u971e\u5bfa)\nThe Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing (restored) (\u5927\u62a5\u6069\u5bfa\u7409\u7483\u5854)\nMochou Lake and Park (\u83ab\u6101\u6e56)\nYangshan Quarry (\u9633\u5c71\u7891\u6750)\nSouthern Tang Mausoleums (\u5357\u5510\u4e8c\u9675)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Republic of China period ===\nBecause it was designated as the national capital, many structures were built around that time.

          "We took a day trip to Nanjing from Shanghai and saw parts of the wall in multiple locations. It was great to have personal guides who spoke English and could give us the history. We visited shortly after the Chinese New Year/Lantern Festival and many lanterns were still up on",
          "Went there for a walk after a business diner, it really gives a feeling for how much history is in Nanjing",
          "Great place to go. You get great views from all around the city. If you are into fitness you can walk all around the walls. I did partway. Was enough for me. There are buggies that Will take you around. Chairs & kiosks to stop & rest. It is a fair walk from one entrance to",
          "Nice to see how the wall is integrated into the city. Around the area are some nice pedestrian shopping areas with some craftmanship stores.",
          "We were really hungry after looking around City wall and our kids was tried after long walks so don\u2019t miss out this. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t look nice outside but the foods were amazing!!! DO NOT Miss this",
          "We visited on a public holiday mid season and I estimate that there were up to one million people in and around the city wall precinct that day. We were in throngs of about 20 people wide on all the streets for most of the day. Absolutely enthralling place to visit...AND the",
          "Really cool walk, plenty of local tourists and impressive lake view and a beautiful Pagoda (10yuan) . You can enjoy one half day over there , be ready for a long walk, worth it!",
          "Fantastic look back into history of Nanjing former capital of China. Really super interesting and well worth the visit",
          "I don\u2019t think that all of the wall is 650 years old, and I certainly didn\u2019t cover the whole length of it (just the part along the lake), but this an impressive monument to the city\u2019s imperial past offering great views. Definitely with visiting this piece of Nanjing heritage if",
          "The Nanjing city wall is the biggest in the world, and with 25 or so km remaining you can still see a lot of it. You have to choose where to go and see it. I followed the advice on an internet site, to go to Zhonghuamen metro station by line 1. When you come out (exit 1 or 2 by",
          "Came here in the evening as I read that the area and view from the top is more beautiful at night. I was not disappointed. We came by subway and the walk from the nearest station is about 1.2 km away. The walls are indeed beautifully lit. The entrance fee of 50 RMB per adult is",
          "Visited the wall in the cool of the evening and walked a few km along the top. What an incredible structure from 650 years ago. The wall is lit up beautifully to view from below. Up on the wall, the lighting is adequate but you do need to watch your step as the walking area is",
          "If this is the only place in China to visit an ancient city wall, by all means do so. The city walls all had an almost identical layout including impressive watch towers and gates. This is a beautiful place to walk and view the city.",
          "There is a small fee to walk on the city wall, but it is well worth it. Not only is it a great place just to see much of the old city, but it's also just a beautiful walk....especially if you go in the early evening or early morning.",
          "If you visit Nanjing you will be overwhelmed by the friendliness of the people and the majesty of the local history. There is plenty to see, particularly around the protected heritage areas and the most obvious example of this is the ancient city wall. Built in the time of the",
          "We walked for many kilometers on the top of this ancient wall. It offers sites that need to be experienced. History & culture are alive and well here",
          "Beautiful view of the City when you\u2019re up on the wall. It is very well kept, also suitable for a jogging trail if you\u2019re into that kind of stuff",
          "I was surprised to see the city wall when I first visited. The wall is a tourist attraction that requires a minimal fee, its a nice walk on the wall, and you will get a great view of the city. It is also decorated with lanterns (some in animal shapes) and lights up at night.",
          "The grimace reflection in the pond is awesome, especially at night! The wall itself is a wall, but with lots of history. Nanjing City has done a great job of making it a nice park and walk along the river just outside the wall.",
          "It was a great walk through the wall with a nice view of the lake. I travel there in May 3 and the weather was nice and sunny so make sure you have hat or umbrella to.",
          "Massive city walls, you pay 30 rmb to enter. Good views over the city. There are also some siege weapons lined up which is a nice touch. You could walk a good hour on the wall, but after half you probably seen it. Good to combine with Jiming temple and Xuanwu lake & park.",
          "Very popular destination which can make it crowded. They have placed large plastic models of Chinese characters all along the top of the wall. The wall is mildly interesting and offers a great view. It is worth going to if you want to tour the old city. Otherwise, I would",
          "If you come to Nanjing, you should try to stand the city wall to review the whole city and imagine the Ming Dynasty.",
          "Yes the reviews are right. Nice walk great scenery and lovely lake. Even though I was here during a holiday and was packed it was a beautiful area and well worth a look",
          "It is nice to see this remnant of another age still standing, although heavily rebuilt I imagine. I walked the section near the Nanjing Museum as I wanted to stay close to the metro. Not as impressive as Xian\u2019s city wall, but good exercise.",
          "With reportedly one of the longest city circular walls in the world, this defensive structure was built to protect the Ming Dynasty in the 1300's. For me the most interesting aspect was that individual bricks in the wall were \"signed\" to indicate where they were made and who",

          "not something special in this place. if you have extra time, visit. otherwise skip. get ready for long walk..",
          "Thought the wall would've been a little more special, with more history narratives, but it's pretty much just a wall. Much wider than the Great Wall, so it looks more formidable and impressive in terms of scale. The carved calligraphy on the bricks are probably the most",
          "I expected to see more about the history of the wall. Perhaps, the special features of the wall, e.g. the calligraphy on the bricks should be given a little more prominence, as this could easily be missed if you are not aware of it. The significance of the wall in Nanjing",
          "A very well presented city wall similar to Xian. Exits and entrances can be problematic if you just wander along the base of the wall. Excellent views of the lake.",
          "Nexus holidays took us through Nanjing and i was surprised to see a fully intact unbroken wall that surrounds the city. It was completed by the Ming dynasty. Apparently the japanese imperial army could not break through for 6 months as the troops behind the wall was well",
          "Erected about 600 years ago by the emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The wall was one of the largest ever built. The whole wall is not there today but much of it remains intact. Nice visit",
          "I was unable to go to the top but the wall is breathtaking and in wonderful condition. I suggest looking into the history prior to your visit.",
          "When you hear about walls in China, everybody thinks of the Great Wall first. However, the City Wall around Nanjing is very impressive in its own rite. It's taller and wider than much of the Great Wall and encircles the large city of Nanjing, which is also an underrated city for",
          "All over China you will see walls, which were used as a means to protect the inhabitants from invaders. Unlike the European castle, the Chinese walls are spread over a larger area and include a bigger piece of land - which means that they tend to be more massive and serpentine.",
          "I am not into history. Sites like this is not my cup of tea. But for those that do want to learn about the history of places, and are history buffs, of course this is an excellent stop. Entrance is free, as it should be so more people can experience and feel history.",
          "As the City Wall is high and the surrounding buildings are low, you can have a great view of Nanjing. Worth visiting as you can also walk to different gates using the City Wall.",
          "Just spent a few minutes walking along part of this wall, but it is amazing. Great views of the city. Really difficult to realise how old the walls are as they are in such good nick.",
          "Nanjing was Capital of China in the past, so we can see the Wall in the midle of the nowadays city just like we can see in Xian. Nice place to visit and get to know more about Chinese History.",
          "Not sure how this wall compares to other walls accross China, but as a gate to the city it was very impressive. The engineering was awesome.",
          "This magnificent City Wall of China is not to be missed. Although, this might not be as old as the one in Xian, this one is better built and the material represented the artisan of its historical period. You will see a great view of the city especially during the evening as the",
          "Nanjing is one of China's ancient capitals and a hidden gem from international tourists. This is one of the oldest city walls in the world that is still standing and you can walk across for kilometers. Additionally on certain stretches it gives a fantastic vantage of the city",
          "It is an old city wall that you can walk over. Really impressive if you consider that it was built by hand. There is information available in English to illustrate the history of the place. Being there I could not help thinking of a certain South park episode.....",
          "I enjoy the history here. Walking where in World War 2 and even further back in time soldiers stood, fought and died. This wall is one such great example of all the above. It's, for the most part, well maintained. I mean it's basically a huge chunk of solid rock. It's going to",
          "A wall of protection. That is how the city dwellers of Nanjing protected themselves. A tall, broad and a well maintained wall with a beautiful sight of the city and over-view of the surrounding. Impressive.",
          "Nice place for visit, photo shooting and picnic. Visited on a sunny day and i suppose summer its best. A walk on the wall is recommended. You have to pay to walk on the Nanjing wall.",
          "Like some other cities in China , Nanjing also has a city wall, this is called the history back. Maintain Well. Recommended to visit there in the evening.",
          "The wall is beautifully preserved and the bricks with the individual stamping of the makers had me fascinated. Loved the canons and enjoyed watching many brides have their photos taken. Beautiful views over the park and lake also.",
          "Not as impressive as the city wall in Xi'An but a very nice walk along the lake side especially on a nice day",
          "Well preserved wall with massive park and grounds to explore. We were able to explore different facets of the park and observe the daily routines of the local Nanjingers. We also visited Buddhist temple which is adjacent to wall , very intriguing.",
          "Even though it was rainy and foggy, the views of the city and the lake were impressive from the top of the city wall. It is a good idea to spend some time walking over it and be impressed by the blossomed trees, old temples and dominant skyscrapers.",
          "Nanjing is doing an amazing job with air pollution, and sunset at the Wall is a must-do. We were there on a Sunday night, and it seems like every family in Nanking had the same idea. Note how the brick makers had to place their names on individual bricks to ensure their quality.",
          "Worth the money to go up on the old wall. Provides a good view back over Nanjing one way and over the lake the other.",
          "If I were to redo the walk on the wall around XuanWu Lake, I would have started from ShenCe Gate at ShenCeMen Park (northern end of XuanWu lake, a nearby metro stop would be the Nanjing Railway Station stop on the green line or XinMoFan stop on the blue line) and walk",
          "We walked the section of the wall near Xuanwu lake. It costs $30 RMB per person, but those older than 60 are free. Students are also half price. Once you get up on the wall, it goes for miles and miles and is very well preserved. Many bricks are stamped with writing and it is",
          "Go here along with Jiming temple and Xuanwu lake. They are all right next to each other and it makes for an amazing day in Nanjing! It is a good walking distance from the metro and I dont remember the exact prices but they were very reasonable, especially for students like me",
          "Thanks to the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, the city wall of Nanjing was erected. The wall was to consolidate his sovereignty and keep out invaders. This city wall of Nanjing was among the largest city walls ever constructed in China. This 600 year old city",
          "This was a gate to Nanjing. Make sure you do not get caught in the middle. They might pour hot oil on you. In Chinese men=gate. Good for about 1 hour visit",
          "Walked the length of the wall which was super relaxing in the afternoon. Find the concept of the wall very intriguing.",
          "Leaving the Jiming Temple, we took a 5 minutes\u2019 walk to the Nanjing City Wall. Current Nanjing City Wall is built in Ming Dynasty, some 600 years ago. In order to cope with the winding landscape, unlike most of the Chinese City Walls (e.g., Xi-an), the Nanjing City Wall was",
          "One of the best preserved city walls in Asia I\u2019ve come across. Great views and some interesting artefacts. Unfortunately not wheelchair accessible, but once you\u2019re up on the top it\u2019s suitable for all ages.",
          "Start the wall walk at the Jiming Temple pagoda, if you can make the climb. The scenery is terrific, and you will experience both the inner wall near the pagoda, and the lake wall. At the lake wall, I suggest walking north to the gate by the lake\u2019s park entrance. Only a couple",
          "It is right next to he Jiming Temple. You can visit the temple and climb up to the city wall where you will find beautiful scenery of the city s well as the lake that the walls are surrounding. This lake was the naval training center during the empire period.",
          "Visited in November 2017, great to walk around, with great views of the city and river. Highly recommended if visiting Nanjing",
          "There are ample spots around the city to visit the Nanjing City Walls. As we only wanted a whistle-stop tour of the wall we were advised to go to the part of the wall at Taiping Gate where the entrance fee also includes a visit to a small museum within the wall complex. The",
          "It's easy to get to and the section we went to is right next to the Jiming Temple, in fact I believe you can access the wall from the temple by going over a small bridge. There was a small exhibit inside one of the guard houses explaining the history of the wall and with an",
          "Lovely place to walk and see different parts of the city. We accessed it by the lake and then walked past a number of gates",
          "Not far from the city center, and very convenient to visit. We were here last month, the autumn view was amazing.",
          "The old city wall still exists only in sections, some much larger than others. The biggest section surrounds Xuanwuhu Park and requires a RMB30 fee to enter and climb. The wall is amazing, but there's really not much need to climb it or walk along the top as once you're there",
          "We went on a Saturday and there was literally no one on the wall. It was a beautiful walk with some great views of the whole city. An excellent adventure. Also you can rent bikes if you don't want to walk. They even have a seat for a three year old to hang on to.",
          "There are 2 entrance to the City Wall. If you want to see the whole of Nanjing, this is a great place to see it. Can walk on top of the wall to experience the ancient Nanjing",

          "Not much to see, just a wall. It's kept up in good shape but what can you say about a wall? Lots of food and things around to pass the time and relax but a wall can only be so exciting?",
          "Walking the Nanjing City Wall is wonderful - see the lake & the city on mostly flat surfaces. The climb up to the wall is steep stairs, but the wall itself is an easy walk. Take bottled water. You can walk several miles if you plan ahead. Strongly recommend this.",
          "A great city to walk around and explore. And the wall is amazing and to think that it remains after all of these days and years is great. Great for a walk on a nice morning or afternoon.",
          "Easy sightseeing , about one hour at slow pace. Educational exhibits in English. There is a fun shopping area just outside gate of City Wall, Hunan Lu.",
          "If you like an ancient walls, you should see this one also. But behind the wall is large lake where you sit and rest, or rent some boats to go around the lake. There pedals or electric boats. You will have fantastic view from your boat over significant part of the city.",
          "I went on a week day and had the wall almost all to myself. You can get a really nice view of the lake and the surrounding area, very beautiful and peaceful.",
          "We saw the wall and gates at many places, but got onto the wall at the Timing Temple and walked east a long way. There is a good view of the lake below and the mountains with the tombs and memorials as well. Just thinking about the height and the breadth of the wall in its",
          ". . . visit, even if you've visited other walls. Yes, it's similar, but it's also different, especially from northern cities. The bricks are not like many others. Walkway is narrower in many places. Access stairs around the wall are not like many others. You can tell it's",
          "This city wall is amazing. You can see quite a bit views of lake near it. It's connected to a temple which is famous for its sakuras in the spring. It's a nice place for families to go.",
          "Entrance fee: 50 yuan/person On the first floor, there are three tunnels with some short explanation in Chinese, English, Japanese, and sometimes Korean language. There is also archery if you want to try, price is 20 yuan and you get 8 arrows (if I'm not mistaken). Climbing to",
          "Big Cty wall is impressing by its lenght and hight. We walked about 2 km admiring the magnificent view of Nanjing. At the end was a Temple with monastry. Awesome!",
          "All this area in general is wonderful. Is a great place to visit, but you will need to do a little bit of walking to truly enjoy it.",
          "Take a nice stroll along the wall that kept Nanjing safe. You can see the whole city and get some amazing pictures.",
          "Similar to other city walls, but covering a very big area. The South Gate was interesting, but wall itself was just fine. Bike rentals weren't great. Compared to other city walls, like the one in Xi'An, it's nothing special.",
          "boring. all walls are not created equal but they are all quite boring. definitely not a must see attraction while here",
          "The wall is quite impressive for how long it is, size, and historical significance. At the China Gate there are golf cart rentals to ride along the wall. Other places it's nice to just walk along the wall and enjoy your day. Combine with visit to Xuanwu Lake to see both and have",
          "We drove by it several times and it was cool all the time. There were engravings on the wall and it was so cool to see the history of this wonderful city!",
          "Perhaps coming from the US, old things like this are particularly interesting. This wall was interesting but not as big as the city wall in Xian...and needless to say the Great Wall, but still interesting to look at and walk along. The most interesting part was a demonstration",
          "When in Nanjing it is easy for you to combine a visit to the Nanjing City Wall and Xuanwu lake since the lake is next to the wall. The city wall is impressive and dates back to the Ming dynasty. Since Nanjing was the capital of the Ming it makes sense that a wall was built to",
          "Cost 30RMB to climb the stairs to the wall. Those above get in at halh price...hehe, need proof of age. There's nothing special and unlike the Xi'an wall and Beijing wall, this has some sort of English transaltion describing when and how the wall was built.",
          "The wall is great for a walk around the city. It's well kept and there are many different areas you can explore, e.g. walk next to the lake on the northern side or close to zhong hua men in the south. There's something for everyone.",
          "Entered near museum just before December sunset. Light mist and cold, had it all to ourselves. Thousands of bricks have writing and makers mark still plainly visible from the 1360's. While lights on edges of crenellations and gates diffused in mist. 28 years to construct using",
          "One of the few wall still largely intact in many places. We entered near the Zhongshan Gate and from there we had good views over the lake and surrounding area. The only downside now is that there is an entry fee, fewer access points to the wall, and limited entry times.",
          "I think it's a great place to visit, first you can explore the Zhonghua Gate in Old town and the either take a walk along the wall or rent bike / golf car. Be prepared for a long way. And bring your water with you ) Entry fee is 50 yuan. Attraction opens at 10am and closes at",
          "We took the south wall gate entrance and rented a golf cart type vehicle. That was so fun to stop to take pictures and hit the bumps. You get it for one hour so that was more than even time to do the whole wall where they allow the carts.",
          "I spent the morning walking around the lake and then a good few hours exploring the wall, which was great. Even though its not as impressive as the Great Wall or Xian its still pretty cool and a great way to understand the history of Nanjing. Off you go then!",
          "One of the many city walls around the Nanjing city. Take a 2-hour walk along the top of the walls for some good views of the Xuanwu lake.",
          "Nanjing's city walls are certainly impressive. But I preferred the walls at for example Xi'an, as you can cycle at the top of them (whereas in Nanjing, you can just walk along the walls at the bottom). Still, there are quite a lot of footpaths along the bottom of the walls, so",
          "I was taken to this place by the conference organizers. Its a beautiful place and you get one of the best views of the Nanjing city atop of this wall. It is rich in its heritage and gives a deep insight into the defenses of the Ming dynasty. The view especially of the sunset",
          "The wall is great to look at and has a lot of history to it; unfortunately, a lot of the history you will have to find on your own. I do recommend seeing it and looking into the hostory",
          "A formidable structure, left intact at least 700 years. Some 200-years old cannons on the top. Number of gates of different sizes.",
          "i walked the wall from 4pm to sunset. It was wonderful - peaceful without the noise of the city and with few crowds but able to see all the city old and new. only cost 30rmb too - a bargain",
          "There are several wall entrances within Nanjing and the one that appeared in the google map section can be accessed at the exit of Jiming Temple. Some of the walls can be accessed for free but most require a ticket to enter.",
          "I went with a couple of friends onto the Nanjing city wall, the section near Zhonghuamen. There the walkable (or rideable, bike rental at the start) part is about 4km long. Very nice views of the city. While being on the wall notice the inscriptions on the stones, these are",
          "Impressive wall which provides an opportunity to walk along sections an enjoy the contrasting views from each side. Take snacks and drinks to enjoy a few hours",
          "Fun to walk on the wall and see how the town was protected. Views at all points were stunning. Walking the wall was difficult as it is uneven.",
          "You should visit if you have a chance and be astonished by the amount of history within the district. And the temple is next to it, so it's a two in one visit.",
          "This wall is more than 650 years, built (finished) in Ming Dynasty. The wall is still standing around Nanjing and the original bricks are covered with Chinese characters on one side, do you know why? It`s on the list of World Heritage, hope we can make it.",
          "This place is good for picnic, gathering and also for a long walk in the evening along the lake. Lighting kites make sky more beautiful.",
          "Extraordinary nice, with beautiful lake view (starting the walk from Jinming temple). An underrated piece of China. Rather than sharing one square meter with 1000 other people on the most busy pieces of the Great Wall, go here and enjoy a relaxing walk.",
          "Check out the many bricks inscribed with the makers name and details, done as a form of quality control. It is a pity that some of the restorations done are bodges using the wrong materials.",
          "Walking up and up and when you think you are at the destination a few more steps but well worth it The temple at the top is worth going up just for the view",
          "The view from the city wall includes the tallest building in Nanjing & the ancient Buddhist nunnery- old meets new in China again. Fascinating!",
          "There are some sections of the wall that are so quiet and peaceful, without any other tourists around, you'll forget you're in a modern tier 2 city! It reminds me of the city wall in Xi'an, except a lot more peaceful (and less wide).",
          "It is an impressive place, the wall is tall and wide, very well built and and its conditions is just excellent. During day time is good to watch the extension, the weapons reproduction shown in there as well as the details of the construction, the signed bricks and impressive",
          "One of the best attraction in Nanjing. It's a beautiful place to spend the day. The park is free but you have to pay 30 RMB to go to the wall.",
          "There are many different places to get up on the Nanjing Wall. I like the nearest to Laomendong. Here, built into the wall are large rooms where soldiers were barracked. There are also some small historical exhibits which are interesting.",
          "When you think of the invasions of Nanjing over the years the fact that this wall remains standing is truly amazing!",
          "The old city wall offers great views (especially the section by the lake) and a good way of walking between sites such as the lake and the chicken temple. Beware that it offers no shade in Nanjing's very hot summers.",
          "One of the many attractions in China with a great history. You may walk a few kilometers overviewing parts of the city.",
          "The Nanjing city wall was the longest in the world when it was built (16th c). Long sections of it are still in existence. Visit the Zonghua Gate in the south for a great experience of the wall and its defensive role.",
          "Beautiful, peaceful and historic entrance fee require in order to enter overlook breathtaking scenic of Xuan Wu Lake and Jiming Temple",
          "We explored the wall in a couple of places and recommend: 1. Daytime - from the Jiming Temple with views of the XuanWu Lake and Park, Jiming Pagoda and Intercontinental hotel tower 2. Nighttime - from the Zhonghua Gate when the wall is nicely lit-up (come between 6.30-8pm) Each",
          "The Nanjing City Wall has a few entrances but the main one is at Zhonghua Men. Needs to pay an entrance fee. The walk on top of the wall is quite breath taking as it will show you a different view of Nanjing. The walk can take at least 1.5h with some exit points along the way.",
          "This was the first stop I made when I arrived in Nanjing on a bullet train from Shanghai. Not many taxi drivers spoke English in Nanjiang so I feverishly googled City Wall of Nanjing and several places popped up. One of them is on the outskirt of the city in a scenic area.",
          "Very well maintained. As you would expect at a city wall, there are lots of steps, but they are even and of human size not like the Great Wall. Well worth the effort to climb and walk. Entry is reasonable and like most Chinese historic sites there are concessionary prices for",
          "First time we went to the wall (around 2013), there were a couple of entrances you could go up the wall and some were free of charge. This time only one (proper/official) entrance was open and you had to pay the entrance fee. Just after the entrance you can read up about the",
          "Great views of the city and nice to walk around. The Great Wall is not much wider but is more imposing because of its altitude. It is definitely a place where a sunhat is required on a hot day.",
          "It's part of the city and you won't miss it. I suggest you to get onto the city wall via Zhong Hua Men before sunset and take a walk along the wall for 1 hour or so, I think it's the most beautiful scenery in Nanjing. Entrance fee is 50RMB from memory.",
          "It was raining and cold for May in Nanjing, a walk from Zhonghua Gate to Wuding Gate is not enjoyable, but definitely memorable. Looking at the whole city rain, you look at the fragile and saddening history",
          "Honestly it is quite a beautiful wall in between the park and the city. Definitely a must do if you go to Nanjing ! The ticket price is 30RMB if i remember correctly.",
          "The ming wall offers a great view and offers a great history of this beautiful city .This is the longest city wall in the world,and there is plenty of space to move around.",
          "nice wall in the middle of the city (longest city wall of the world) with an nice park and lake for lazy Sunday\u00b4s",
          "Not really excitement for this place its just like a wall and u need to walk all the way middle of the city no really good natural effective not really clean.",
          "It's not bad, but it's nothing special. It offers a chance to look at the city and park for a little higher up, and the exercise is good. But unless you know your Chinese history, it's just a walk on a stone wall. For me, the Great Wall of China is more impressive. On hot",
          "City wall buily during the Ming dynasty. It is very impressive with large parts remaining or restored. The main gate is particularly impressive, exhibitions however a bit boring.",
          "Other cities had their walls torn down in the rush to modernize, but for political reasons Nanjing was put last in line to receive modernization. Good thing!",
          "It's a well preserved relic site from thousands years ago. I enter the site from Zhonghua Gate and walk along 3 km to the south. In the right side you can see the beautiful Qinhuai River where locals do their morning strolls, fishing and biking. More to the south you can catch a",
          "I didn't get to walk on the wall as we visited rather late in the day. However we walked around part of the lake admiring the very impressive wall. Don't remember seeing too many other city walls that are as intact as this one. Very pleasant evening stroll along the lake,",
          "I really enjoyed taking a walk on this ancient and giant wall. Also provides you with stunning views of the lake and city.",
          "Ignore whoever said you can't walk on the wall. Yes you can. You pay \u00a530, but you can. Amazing piece of history and views of the lake",
          "Even though it was raining and foggy on the day we visited the city wall it was worth it. Quite impressive dimensions of height, depth, lenght...",
          "Took the metro to Sanshan Street on line 1 and then walked down to the Gate of China. We spent some time here and then walked east for a good hour and a half until the wall ended at the water gate. Good opportunity to see parts of the city on both sides.",
          "You can virtually feel the history of the Ming Wall by touching it and its amazing it stood the test of time despite the turbulence of mankind. The wall has outlived its purpose and now stand as a remembrance to the past that we should learn from. The only disappointment is that",
          "Nanjing's history is one of protection of its people. The various sections of the Ming City Wall are important starting point of the tour.",
          "Worth the climb up the stairs, a fun visit that is definitely worth revisiting with different lights and weather. Excellent for architecture and history buffs. And pretty cheap",
          "I was in Nanjing China for an official visit. We took some time off one afternoon to pay a visit to the Nanjing City Wall and it was a worthwhile experience. I have not been to the Great Wall of China but the visit to the Nanjing City wall was itself an eye opener. To see the",
          "The city wall provides good views but it is also difficult to leave, so make sure you use it as an itinerary item rather than a shortcut as you may get frustrated. Very limited entry and exit points",
          "If you have time have a look at the wall and enjoy the view over the City. If you are lucky you will find bike rentals. We did it although it started to rain but we had a lot fun.",
          "If you are in Nanjing you have to go to the wall. Not as long and impressive as Beijing but very well preserved and rebuilt. You can spend an hour walking at the top or even hire a bike and bike around. There is a very small museum and a small coffeshop. Unfortunately the view",
          "Entrance fee RMB 30. 25km in total. A good place to see Ji Ming temple and xuanwu lake, especially for the sunset. Not so crowded. quiet and peaceful walk!",
          "If you are in Nanjing you definitely want to spend few hours walking on the City Wall. It's a historical and cultural stroll, which I recommend to rent a bike if you want to visit it entirely.",
          "Not much to look at but an interesting history. We drove around the city and had a review about the wall, etc.",
          "The City Wall and the Scenic Place are actually one and the same. Whether you enter from up or down, the entry fee is 30 RMB. The Wall: The wall, designed by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang after he founded the Ming Dynasty. Nanjing, the former capital over 600 years ago, the wall took",
          "We took the subway to this site and walked about 1km. We took the bus back to the subway station. We ate along the way and there wasnt much food to eat there. The entrance fee was 30-50Y. Inside was pretty cool and we ended up staying in side the gate for a while and watched",
          "This was an interesting history experience and had nice views along the way. Some steps, but not really strenuous. It did remind me of the Great Wall but much easier to do. It can be a long walk if you desire.",
          "I walked along the wall in an afternoon and it was very pleasant. Could see the lake and had a great view of the city.",
          "a must see while in town - visit the wall at the Gate of China. it gives you an idea of the great history of Nanjing",
          "The architecture must be excellent considering the period. The engineering must be perfect to build such a wall. I was told repair and modernisation was done to the wall and I still the whole wall site is impressive. Next to the Great Wall of China, this mini version of wall",
          "Very impressive site which we thoroughly enjoyed and spent a surprising large amount of time there. We loved the views from the top of the wall and wished we had walked a bit further on the wall but it was really great to see the sections we saw. If you have been to the Great",
          "There are only a few 'types' of attraction in the world, whether they are museums, sky scrapers or monuments. The Nanjing City Wall is almost a type in itself. It is remarkable how well preserved it is and frankly how what an amazing achievement it is. A wall built brick",
          "One of the highlights of Nanjing. A very well preserved medieval wall with nice views of the city. Do not recommend to walk the whole length on a sunny day.",
          "Once up on the wall we had to walk some way before we could get back down at another gate. I know, I should have known better than to take a small child, but normally she's good at such things, but this particular place did not capture her imagination. It was a hot day and it",
          "Truly amazing that such a large tall and long wall was constructed to surround the city. The work put into this and the effort to maintain and restore it is excellent. Well done to the people of Nanjing",
          "A nice walk with a great view of the lakes and the city. A nice tea house and a museum to visit the wall.",
          "A wall in near original condition. Don't wear your heals to this one ladies the floor is quite uneven. Great views, well worth a vist",
          "This is a well preserved city wall from the Ming Dynasty. It stretches very long and is a great place for a stroll especially in spring or autumn.",
          "It was incredible to walk on something as old as the city wall and look at the new city. The contrast is mind-blowing and I think you have to go.",
          "If you are passing by, you might want to take a peek. But, it is not something you need to go out of your way to see.",
          "Visited in November 2012, as usual city walls like this is very STRONG! A fortress type of wall that protects the city from wild invaders. Very similar to the Great Wall in Badaling or Mutianyu) Nice place to be)",
          "I am very fond of historic wall in every old city. It is really amazing to walk on the top of this hundred years built city wall of this old city. Though it is narrower than the one in Xian, it is still an interesting and momorable experiencef for a complete walking. When you",
          "I think it needs more middle-exit down the wall aheading to lake side.",
          "Its the only wall built around the city in the world, its an amazing sites to be, just like the great wall of china in Beijing. You can walk up and around the wall on a pleasant evening, there are some nice food streets around the place that you may enjoy, If you are in Nanjing",
          "True piece of history. Go in the direction of the Olympic rings and go to the top. It's scenic, there's a small museum, and you can see areas both inside and outside the Xuanwu Lake area.",
          "Made forsafety of this ancient city, but now population and city limits exceeds much more outside wall. Still a landmark attraction for tourist. Well maintained wall.",
          "The Ming City Wall is quite broad and large. It spans several dozen km and goes through many parts of the city you wouldn't get a great view of otherwise. You can walk as much or as little as you want as there are several exits, and the engrish signs all over the place really",
          "The city wall is quite huge. I usually go up at the Xuanwumen side and walk until I get to Jiefangmen. That is usually a nice relaxing stroll that takes about 1 hour. But the whole wall is quite long and there are multiple access sites. From above you get great views of the",
          "No need to risk your life crossing the busy streets, you cruise on a large elevated hiking trail, which is the 650 years old, one of the longest city walls in the world. You learn about the history of Nanjing on the way and discover the sweeping views of the city. Best urban",
          "Yes, you're just walking on a wall...but I LOVED it! There was hardly anyone else up on the wall, the day was beautiful, and it was so peaceful to walk up there and look out over the beautiful Xuanwu park. I was able to go up for only 15 RMB because of the student discount. I",
          "There are lots of places to get up on the wall most of them cost money. But the views are great. Make sure you have good shoes on and some water. There is not water to buy on most of the wall and if your older it will get very hot.",
          "Seems silly when the actual attraction is the wall, which is better seen when you are not actually on it. If you are really interest in walking atop it, then you should visit another site that allows access to the wall - like Yuejiang temple - and kill two birds with one stone.",
          "You see once of this many walls in other parts of China and you see all and unless you are into chinese history of the different dynasty, you may just not look in ewe. ..a good view once you are up ghe walls n try to imagine back then the life of soldiers n etc.mings dynasty has",
          "There are 25km worth of walls that can be walked on. We paid 30 RMB (students were free) and walked from Xuan Wu Gate to the Jiming Temple (Olympic rings). It was worth it. If you could rent a bike and ride along that would be fun too. They have done a nice reconstruction",
          "Its just a wall built by an emperor. A bit far from Zhonghuamen metro station. You won't find taxis easily. Entrance ticket is 50/person. 50%Discount for students. Only the view from the top is good.",
          "The old town wall is very cool. The view is good and very cozy place.",
          "The Nanjing City Wall is a fantastic sight to see and well worth the effort to visit if you find yourself in Nanjing. It is said to be the largest intact city wall in China. And honestly, I preferred it to the much more famous Great Wall outside Beijing. Perhaps because it",
          "Great views, and some good walks along the top. Cant do the whole city but the sections you can do are really impressive and you see all sorts looking over the sides at the old cit",
          "This is a superb example of a garrison fortification. Get down to the South Gate and start from here. There is a huge citadel with defences and battlements all around. The big thing here is that the bricks were made with inscriptions telling who paid or sponsored the brick,",
          "like a younger small healthier version of the great wall but no tourist. lovely views around of city and lake area! easy to get around. some tower have informative history bits too",
          "I love to get a perspective of a city from above if possible and from an ancient wall is even more special. Allow yourself some time to walk some of the many kilometers of wall that surround the city and sit adjacent to the lake and rivers. It is a great way to enjoy some",
          "Nothing special......you can tell by the lack of Chinese tourists who usually are in great numbers at big attractions",
          "Despite the damage caused during the Japanese invasion of Nanjing, much of the walls are intact and very enjoyable to walk where you can.",
          "Awesome City Wall ! Really impressive what people could build without a machines. Well maintained City Wall is very high and pretty wide on some places. You can view a modern city of NanJing with skyscrapers on the one side and the mountain above the lake on the another side of",
          "It's a portion of a wall. What else can you say? It's fairly clean, it's been restored so it's not like you're looking at ancient ruins. Lots of foliage to see as you walk along, quite a few places to sit and rest. And it's free.",
          "The wall is an important cultural relic for the inscriptions on the bricks. The Nanjing citizens attach great importance to the work of protecting the wall and access to climb onto the wall is limited.",
          "Awesome place. Wear comfy shoes and clothes, bring an umbrella for rain and sun, and a poncho. It rained in the middle of the day. You will go up the mountain with a ski lift chair. Coming down, you have an option of ski lift or a wagon!!!!",
          "I went to the Shanghai railway station and found the English window (49). A colleague already printed out the train schedule for the day of all Gtrains to Nanjing so I circled the train I wanted and handed it to the agent. She indicated there were no 2nd class seats on that",
          "Absolutely include this on your itinerary as it provides a fabulous perspective of fortifications - and the need for same - in centuries past. The length and complexity of the wall when it was constructed is quite extraordinary and you can certainly feel the history as you walk",
          "I had other plans for the day but somehow ended walking this wall and was very impressed without knowing at the time any of the history of the wall. You get great views to Xuanwuhu Lake and park below, the Purple Mountain district and the city. I walked this wall and continued",
          "A great story behind this wall with a great view from the top to the outer areas of the city. Back in the day you would have had to crazy to try and penetrate all four gates to get through the city wall! If the archers didn't get you the soldiers running out of the hidden dens",
          "I couldn't help thinking, as we approached Nanjing, of the sorrowful history of the massacre in 1937, I thought the city would still have a pall hanging over it but not at all. It is a thriving, happy bustling place, situated at the foot of a mountain but very flat in itself",
          "This wall is placed between jiming temple and xuanwu lake.. i don't really have a plan to went here but since i have to cross it so it doesn't hurt to take a look.. the wall was really big and long, it reminds me of great wall only this one located in the middle of the city..",
          "The wall is pretty impressive even as Nanjing is modernizing itself. It's a landmark to add to set Nanjing apart from other cities in China.",
          "This one impressive wall. One of only three large city walls left in China. It even manages to outshine the Xian city wall not only in length but also in sheer audacity. It was built around 1370 and is 33 km long. I'm not sure if its complete as I only saw sections of it.",
          "The wall is magnificent and beautiful, a must see if you're in Nanjing. You can actually catch glimpses of it as you are traveling on the road, but standing on top of it is just different. There's no shop or activities here, just walking and admiring the views and materiality of",
          "An interesting relic is what I would categorize this attraction. I did make it a point to travel here to visit, and enjoy the park with my guitar a couple of hours before leaving for Shanghai.",
          "Walked the section along Xuanwu Lake. It's quiet on the wall, with views of Xuanwu Lake & the city. The wall is well preserved and feels quite imposing in some parts. Hard to believe they are hundreds of years old. Saw a couple of exhibits along the walk but they were only in",
          "Like a mini great wall. Very quiet and nice views. Go to the one connected to the temple also so you can knock out 2 in one.",
          "Had a great trip out to the Nanjing wall - very interesting and you can explore lots of the nooks etc - Make sure you feel the bricks inside the tunnels for hiding the soldiers in (they are warm in winter!) Well worth a trip out!",
          "This may be a false impression, but I felt the city wall was respected, not artificially preserved but allowed to stand with its own presence a reminder of power through the ages. The wall is huge, part of the modern landscape (with children playing on the top, in care of",
          "Have walked the entire walk a number of times with members of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center community. Delightful group outing. Entire walk takes anywhere from 6-10 hours, with lunch and other breaks. Some fantastic parts; some, not so.",
          "We walked from the lake to the wall and paid our 30RMB for the two of us to go onto it! not sure what that meant. Walked along the wall for about a mile, great views over the lake and parts of the city, on public holiday it was busy but not crowded busy like the rest of Nanjing",
          "The City Wall is of the ancient times that still stands till today. There are so much of additional items added where it is mixed with the contemporary. Having aid that, it is still a tourist attraction, and locals come here everyday to walk around, exercise. If you are a fan",
          "If you had a bicycle ride on the Xian wall - you'd better not to go there. Most of pieces are still under reconstruction, the reconstructed parts though are a bit far from perfect also.",
          "You need to take a small stroll on these walls as they give you a complete different view of the city of Nanjing. See temples and lakes from a (low flying) bird eye view.",
          "..... and it's in amazingly good condition. It extends a very great distance and speaks of the deep history of this extraordinary city.",
          "Like other cities Nanjing has its own wall in which from different parts of the city you can get access and depending on the side you get in you can have nice view of the city.",
          "On a sunny day it was pleasant to chill out by the walls and the moat. Very picturesque but if it was in another city it wouldn't be notable.",
          "The city wall is totally reconstructed and you can not walk along most of it - only climb to the top of one of the gate towers and look around. A couple of interesting exhibits are found within the caves of the wall. Overall, this is worth maximum an hour of your time.",
          "How did they built this magnificent structure. Walk along it and imagine what is is like hundreds of years ago. Strong winds to be expected if you go during the cooler months. Bring along warm clothing a.",
          "The wall can be visited in several different areas. In many ways it is like many of the other city walls that can be visited in China. This one gives yo a nice view because the wall is quite tall. We were here at dusk so they started closing parts of the wall. It was this",
          "Walked over to this from the Nanjing Intercontinental when a meeting finished early. It's an easy walk, straight down Beijing Street from the roundabout and the to the left when you see the big yellow temple. The Temple is beautiful, too! But don't miss out on the wall. Walk",
          "Built by the first Ming emperor 600 years ago at great expense with 200,000 laborers over 21 years, this city wall is truly magnificant and is one of the best preserved in China. The wall is beautiful by itself, but unfortunately it is currently adorned by ostentatious,",
          "Enjoy a nice stroll on the wall and visit the museum to understand this incredible structure. You can walk down to the lake and enjoy Te peach blossoms this time of the year!",
          "Take the time to see this wall if you can. Sure it's not the Great Wall, but it's less crowded and still very impressive. Note: it maybe quite difficult to get a taxi from this area.",
          "The wall at Nanjing is one of the best examples of a Chinese city wall. The intact and restroed sections are very impressive and much taller than many walls in China. The section at Jiming temple is probably the best.",
          "Nanjing's city wall is very well conservated and still exist in most if not all places. Worth a look at when you visit Nanjing...",
          "Impressive achievement but under utilized for tourism purposes, most of the wall is inaccessible. Size is more impressive than Xian, but access is not.",
          "Although the wall is just that, a huge brick wall...it is well-built and looks like it would protect to the people. It is next to a park and you can hit golf balls into the lake there.",

        "wiki": "The Nanjing Massacre or the Rape of Nanjing (alternately written as the Nanking Massacre or the Rape of Nanking) was an episode of mass murder and mass rape committed by Imperial Japanese troops against the residents of Nanjing (Nanking), then the capital of China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nThe massacre occurred over a period of six weeks starting on December 13, 1937, the day that the Japanese captured Nanjing. During this period, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army murdered disarmed combatants and Chinese civilians numbering an estimated 40,000 to over 300,000, and perpetrated widespread rape and looting.Since most Japanese military records on the killings were kept secret or destroyed shortly after the surrender of Japan in 1945, historians have been unable to accurately estimate the death toll of the massacre. In 1946, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo estimated that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident. China's official estimate is more than 300,000 dead based on the evaluation of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947. The death toll has been contested by scholars since the 1980s.The event remains a contentious political issue and an obstacle in Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese government has been accused of exaggerating aspects of the massacre such as the death toll by many Japanese; historical negationists and Japanese nationalists go as far as claiming the massacre was fabricated for propaganda purposes. The controversy surrounding the massacre remains a central issue in Japanese relations with other Asia-Pacific nations, such as South Korea.The Government of Japan has admitted to the killing of many non-combatants, looting and other violence committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of Nanjing, and Japanese veterans who served there have confirmed that a massacre took place. A small but vocal minority in the Japanese government and society have argued that the death toll was military in nature and that no such crimes ever occurred. Denial of the massacre and revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of Japanese nationalism. In Japan, public opinion of the massacre varies but few deny outright that the event occurred.\n\n\n== Military situation ==\nIn August 1937, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai where they met strong resistance and suffered heavy casualties. The battle was bloody as both sides faced attrition in urban hand-to-hand combat. By mid-November the Japanese had captured Shanghai with the help of naval and (aerial) bombardment. The General Staff Headquarters in Tokyo initially decided not to expand the war due to the high casualties incurred and the low morale of the troops. Nevertheless, on December 1, headquarters ordered the Central China Area Army and the 10th Army to capture Nanjing, then-capital of the Republic of China.\n\n\n== Relocation of the capital ==\nAfter losing the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek knew that the fall of Nanjing was a matter of time. He and his staff realized that they could not risk the annihilation of their elite troops in a symbolic but hopeless defense of the capital. To preserve the army for future battles, most of it was withdrawn. Chiang's strategy was to follow the suggestion of his German advisers to draw the Japanese army deep into China and use China's vast territory as a defensive strength. Chiang planned to fight a protracted war of attrition to wear down the Japanese in the hinterland of China.\n\n\n=== Strategy for the defense of Nanjing ===\nIn a press release to foreign reporters, Tang Shengzhi announced the city would not surrender and would fight to the death. Tang gathered about 100,000 soldiers, largely untrained, including Chinese troops who had participated in the Battle of Shanghai. The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the president left on December 7, leaving the fate of Nanjing to an International Committee led by John Rabe, a German national.\nIn an attempt to secure permission for this cease-fire from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Rabe, who was living in Nanjing and had been acting as the Chairman of the Nanjing International Safety Zone Committee, boarded the USS Panay on December 9. From this gunboat, Rabe sent two telegrams. The first was to Chiang through an American ambassador in Hankow, asking that Chinese forces \"undertake no military operations\" within Nanjing. The second telegram was sent through Shanghai to Japanese military leaders, advocating for a three-day ceasefire so that the Chinese could withdraw from the city. \nThe following day, on December 10, Rabe got his answer from the Generalissimo. The American ambassador in Hankow replied that although he supported Rabe's proposal for a ceasefire, Chiang did not. Rabe says that the ambassador also \"sent us a separate confidential telegram telling us that he has been officially informed by the Foreign Ministry in Hankow that our understanding that General Tang agreed to a three-day armistice and the withdrawal of his troops from Nanjing is mistaken, and moreover that Chiang Kai-shek has announced that he is not in a position to accept such an offer.\" This rejection of the committee's ceasefire plan, in Rabe's mind, sealed the fate of the city. Nanjing had been constantly bombed for days and the Chinese troops that remained there were disheartened and had taken to drinking before the city's inevitable fall.\nOn December 11, Rabe found that Chinese soldiers were still residing in areas of the Safety Zone, meaning that it became an intended target for Japanese attack despite the majority being innocent civilians. Rabe commented on how efforts to remove these Chinese troops failed and Japanese soldiers began to lob grenades into the refugee zone.\n\n\n== Approach of the Imperial Japanese Army ==\n\n\n=== Japanese war crimes on the march to Nanjing ===\n\nAlthough the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period. Many atrocities were reported to have been committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing.\n\nAccording to one Japanese journalist embedded with Imperial forces at the time:The reason that the [10th Army] is advancing to Nanjing quite rapidly is due to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and rape as they wish.In his novel Ikiteiru Heitai ('Living Soldiers'), Tatsuz\u014d Ishikawa vividly describes how the 16th Division of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force committed atrocities on the march between Shanghai and Nanjing. The novel itself was based on interviews that Ishikawa conducted with troops in Nanjing in January 1938.Perhaps the most notorious atrocity was a killing contest between two Japanese officers as reported in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and the English-language Japan Advertiser. The contest\u2014a race between the two officers to see who could kill 100 people first using only a sword\u2014was covered much like a sporting event with regular updates on the score over a series of days. In Japan, the veracity of the newspaper article about the contest was the subject of ferocious debate for several decades starting in 1967.In 2000, historian Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi concurred with certain Japanese scholars who had argued that the contest was a concocted story, with the collusion of the soldiers themselves for the purpose of raising the national fighting spirit.In 2005, a Tokyo district judge dismissed a suit by the families of the lieutenants, stating that \"the lieutenants admitted the fact that they raced to kill 100 people\" and that the story cannot be proven to be clearly false. The judge also ruled against the civil claim of the plaintiffs because the original article was more than 60 years old. The historicity of the event remains disputed in Japan.\n\n\n=== Retreating Chinese Troops' Scorched-Earth Policy ===\nThe Nanjing garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to Xiakuan to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates. Targets within and outside of the city walls\u2014such as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages\u2014were completely burnt down, at an estimated value of US$20\u201330 million (1937).\n\n\n=== Establishment of the Nanjing Safety Zone ===\n\nMany Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips. As the Japanese army approached Nanjing, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners. Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16. Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city.German businessman John Rabe was elected as its leader, in part because of his status as a member of the Nazi Party and the existence of the German-Japanese bilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. The Japanese government had previously agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces, and the members of the Committee managed to persuade the Chinese government to move their troops out of the area. The Nanking Safety Zone was demarcated through the use of Red Cross FlagsOn December 1, 1937, Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaochun ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanjing to move into the \"Safety Zone.\" Many fled the city on December 7, and the International Committee took over as the de facto government of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Prince Asaka appointed as commander ===\n\nIn a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito singled Prince Yasuhiko Asaka out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was \"not good.\" He assigned Asaka to Nanjing as an opportunity to make amends. It appears that Hirohito had never learned about, or had refused to admit, Asaka's role in the ensuing massacre.On December 5, Asaka left Tokyo by plane and arrived at the front three days later. He met with division commanders, lieutenant-generals Kesago Nakajima and Heisuke Yanagawa, who informed him that the Japanese troops had almost completely surrounded 300,000 Chinese troops in the vicinity of Nanjing and that preliminary negotiations suggested that the Chinese were ready to surrender.Prince Asaka is alleged to have issued an order to \"kill all captives,\" thus providing official sanction for the crimes which took place during and after the battle. Some authors record that Prince Asaka signed the order for Japanese soldiers in Nanjing to \"kill all captives\". Others assert that lieutenant colonel Isamu Ch\u014d, Asaka's aide-de-camp, sent this order under the Prince's sign-manual without the Prince's knowledge or assent. Nevertheless, even if Ch\u014d took the initiative, Asaka was nominally the officer in charge and gave no orders to stop the carnage.\nWhile the extent of Prince Asaka's responsibility for the massacre remains a matter of debate, the ultimate sanction for the massacre and the crimes committed during the invasion of China were issued in Emperor Hirohito's ratification of the Japanese army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5, 1937.\n\n\n== Battle of Nanjing ==\n\n\n=== Siege of the city ===\nThe Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching the last lines of Chinese resistance, and arriving outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.\n\n\n=== Demand for surrender ===\nAt noon on December 9, the Japanese military dropped leaflets into the city, urging the city of Nanjing to surrender within 24 hours, promising \"no mercy\" if the offer is refused.In the meantime, members of the Committee contacted Tang and proposed a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position.\nJohn Rabe boarded the U.S. gunboat Panay on December 9 and sent two telegrams, one to Chiang Kai-shek by way of the American ambassador in Hankow, and one to the Japanese military authority in Shanghai.\n\n\n=== Assault and capture of Nanjing ===\n\nThe Japanese awaited an answer to their demand for surrender but no response was received from the Chinese by the deadline on December 10. General Iwane Matsui waited another hour before issuing the command to take Nanjing by force. The Japanese army mounted its assault on the Nanjing walls from multiple directions; the SEF's 16th Division attacked three gates on the eastern side, the 6th Division of the 10A launched its offensive on the western walls, and the SEF's 9th Division advanced into the area in-between.On December 12, under heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment, General Tang Sheng-chi ordered his men to retreat. What followed was nothing short of chaos. Some Chinese soldiers stripped civilians of their clothing in a desperate attempt to blend in, and many others were shot by the Chinese supervisory unit as they tried to flee.On 13 December, the 6th and the 116th Divisions of the Japanese Army were the first to enter the city, facing little military resistance. Simultaneously, the 9th Division entered nearby Guanghua Gate, and the 16th Division entered the Zhongshan and Taiping gates. That same afternoon, two small Japanese Navy fleets arrived on both sides of the Yangtze River.\n\n\n=== Pursuit and mopping-up operations ===\nJapanese troops pursued the retreating Chinese army units, primarily in the Xiakuan area to the north of the city walls and around the Zijin Mountain in the east. Although most sources suggest that the final phase of the battle consisted of a one-sided slaughter of Chinese troops by the Japanese, some Japanese historians maintain that the remaining Chinese military still posed a serious threat to the Japanese. Prince Yasuhiko Asaka told a war correspondent later that he was in a very perilous position when his headquarters was ambushed by Chinese forces that were in the midst of fleeing from Nanjing east of the city. On the other side of the city, the 11th Company of the 45th Regiment encountered some 20,000 Chinese soldiers who were making their way from Xiakuan.The Japanese army conducted its mopping-up operation both inside and outside the Nanjing Safety Zone. Since the area outside the safety zone had been almost completely evacuated, the mopping-up effort was concentrated in the safety zone. The safety zone, an area of 3.85 square kilometres, was packed with the remaining population of Nanjing. The Japanese army leadership assigned sections of the safety zone to some units to separate alleged plain-clothed soldiers from the civilians. The number of Chinese soldiers in plain clothes that were executed are estimated to be around 4,000.\n\n\n== Civilian evacuation ==\n\n\n=== Evacuation and flight of civilians ===\nWith the relocation of the capital of China and the reports of Japanese brutality, most of the civilian population fled Nanjing out of fear. Wealthy families were the first to flee, leaving Nanjing in automobiles, followed by the evacuation of the middle class and then the poor, while only the destitute lowest class such as the ethnic Tanka boat people remained behind.More than three quarters of the population had fled Nanjing before the Japanese arrived.\n\n\n== Massacre ==\nEyewitness accounts of Westerners and Chinese present at Nanjing in the weeks after the fall of the city say that, over the course of six weeks following the fall of Nanjing, Japanese troops engaged in mass rape, murder, torture, theft, arson, and other war crimes. Some of these primary accounts, including the diaries of John Rabe and American Minnie Vautrin, came from foreigners who opted to stay behind to protect the Chinese civilians from harm. Other accounts include first-person testimonies of Nanjing Massacre survivors, eyewitness reports of journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel. American missionary John Magee stayed behind to provide a 16 mm film documentary and first-hand photographs of the Nanjing Massacre.\nA group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed a 15-man International Committee on November 22 and mapped out the Nanjing Safety Zone in order to safeguard civilians in the city. The city population of Nanjing inflated drastically during the mid-1930s, as many refugees fled from the Japanese aggression in the north. Rabe and American missionary Lewis S. C. Smythe, secretary of the International Committee and a professor of sociology at the University of Nanking, recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints with the Japanese embassy.\n\n\n=== Massacre contest ===\n\nIn 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and its sister newspaper, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, covered a contest between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division. The two men were described as vying to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanjing. From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangshu Province, China), Mukai had killed 89 people while Noda had killed 78. The contest continued because neither had killed 100 people. By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda had killed 105 people while Mukai had killed 106 people. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest. Therefore, according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun of December 13, they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Mukai and Noda were both arrested and tried as war criminals, and both of them were found guilty and executed by shooting.\n\n\n=== Rape ===\n\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that 20,000 women, including some children and the elderly, were raped during the occupation. A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang raped. The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit mutilation or by penetrating vaginas with bayonets, long sticks of bamboo, or other objects. Young children were not exempt from these atrocities and were cut open to allow Japanese soldiers to rape them.On 19 December 1937, the Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary:\nI know not where to end. Never I have heard or read such brutality. Rape! Rape! Rape! We estimate at least 1,000 cases a night and many by day. In case of resistance or anything that seems like disapproval, there is a bayonet stab or a bullet.\u2026 People are hysterical\u2026 Women are being carried off every morning, afternoon and evening. The whole Japanese army seems to be free to go and come as it pleases, and to do whatever it pleases.\nOn March 7, 1938, Robert O. Wilson, a surgeon at the university hospital in the Safety Zone administrated by the United States, wrote in a letter to his family, \"a conservative estimate of people slaughtered in cold blood is somewhere about 100,000, including of course thousands of soldiers that had thrown down their arms.\" Here are two excerpts from his letters of 15 and 18 December 1937 to his family:The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief. Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning or reason and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital.\n\nLet me recount some instances occurring in the last two days. Last night the house of one of the Chinese staff members of the university was broken into and two of the women, his relatives, were raped. Two girls, about 16, were raped to death in one of the refugee camps. In the University Middle School where there are 8,000 people the Japs came in ten times last night, over the wall, stole food, clothing, and raped until they were satisfied. They bayoneted one little boy of eight who [had] five bayonet wounds including one that penetrated his stomach, a portion of omentum was outside the abdomen. I think he will live.\nIn his diary kept during the aggression against the city and its occupation by the Imperial Japanese Army, the leader of the Safety Zone, John Rabe, wrote many comments about Japanese atrocities. For 17 December:Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital ... Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College\u2026alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.\nThere are also accounts of Japanese troops forcing families to commit incestuous acts. Sons were forced to rape their mothers, and fathers were forced to rape their daughters.\n\n\n=== Massacre of civilians ===\n\nFollowing the capture of Nanjing, a massacre, which was perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), led to the deaths of up to 60,000 residents in the city, a figure difficult to precisely calculate due to the many bodies deliberately burnt, buried in mass graves, or deposited in the Yangtze River by the IJA. Japanese ultra-nationalists have strongly disputed such death tolls, with some claiming that no more than several hundred civilians were killed during the massacre. B. Campbell, in an article published in the journal Sociological Theory, has described the Nanjing Massacre as a genocide, given the fact that residents were still slaughtered en masse during the aftermath, despite the successful and certain outcome in battle. On 13 December 1937, John Rabe wrote in his diary:It is not until we tour the city that we learn the extent of destruction. We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind. The Japanese march through the city in groups of ten to twenty soldiers and loot the shops.\u2026 I watched with my own eyes as they looted the caf\u00e9 of our German baker Herr Kiessling. Hempel's hotel was broken into as well, as [was] almost every shop on Chung Shang and Taiping Road.\nOn 10 February 1938, Legation Secretary of the German Embassy, Rosen, wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend John Magee to recommend its purchase.\n\nDuring the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking \u2013 which, by the way, continues to this day to a considerable degree \u2013 the Reverend John Magee, a member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost a quarter of a century, took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to the atrocities committed by the Japanese.\u2026 One will have to wait and see whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed, as they have indicated, in stopping the activities of their troops, which continue even today.\nOn December 13, about 30 soldiers came to a Chinese house at No. 5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking, and demanded entrance. The door was open by the landlord, a Mohammedan named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha's death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14 [were]. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2\u20133 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7\u20138, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively. The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword.\nOn 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Sh\u016bd\u014d Higashinakano and the publisher Tendensha to pay four million yen in damages to Mrs. Shuqin Xia, who claims to be the 7- or 8-year-old girl who appears in Magee's film. Higashinakano had claimed in his book, Thorough Review of Nanjing Massacre, that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanjing massacre, but he was unable to prove this at trial.\n\nPregnant women were targeted for murder, as their stomachs were often bayoneted, sometimes after rape. Tang Junshan, survivor and witness to one of the Japanese army's systematic mass killings, testified:\nThe seventh and last person in the first row was a pregnant woman. The soldier thought he might as well rape her before killing her, so he pulled her out of the group to a spot about ten meters away. As he was trying to rape her, the woman resisted fiercely.\u2026 The soldier abruptly stabbed her in the belly with a bayonet. She gave a final scream as her intestines spilled out. Then the soldier stabbed the fetus, with its umbilical cord clearly visible, and tossed it aside.\nAccording to Navy veteran Sho Mitani, \"The Army used a trumpet sound that meant 'Kill all Chinese who run away'.\" Thousands were led away and mass-executed in an excavation known as the \"Ten-Thousand-Corpse Ditch\", a trench measuring about 300 m long and 5 m wide. Since records were not kept, estimates regarding the number of victims buried in the ditch range from 4,000 to 20,000. However, most scholars and historians consider the number to be more than 12,000 victims.The Hui people, a minority Chinese group, the majority of them Muslim, suffered as well during the massacre. One mosque was found destroyed and others found to be \"filled with dead bodies.\" Hui volunteers and imams buried over a hundred of their dead following Muslim ritual.\n\n\n=== Extrajudicial killing of Chinese prisoners of war ===\nOn 5 August 1937, the Deputy Minister of Military of Japan notified Japanese Troops in Shanghai of the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners (\"Riku Shi Mitsu No.198\"). The directive also advised staff officers to no longer to use the term Prisoner of War.\n\nSoon after the fall of the city, Japanese troops made a thorough search for Chinese soldiers and summarily arrested thousands of young Chinese men. Many were taken to the Yangtze River, where they were machine-gunned to death. What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops, the Straw String Gorge Massacre, occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18. For most of the morning, Japanese soldiers tied the POWs' hands together. At dusk, the soldiers divided POWs into four columns and opened fire. Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash desperately. It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual. The majority of the bodies were dumped directly into the Yangtze River.The Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at Taiping Gate and murdered them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol and set on fire. The survivors were killed with bayonets.American news correspondents F. Tillman Durdin and Archibald Steele reported seeing corpses of massacred Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanjing Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who worked for The New York Times, toured Nanjing before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. He would later state that he had seen tank guns used on bound soldiers.\nTwo days later, in his report to The New York Times, Durdin stated that the alleys and street were filled with the dead, amongst them women and children. Durdin stated \"[i]t should be said that certain Japanese units exercised restraint and that certain Japanese officers tempered power with generosity and commission,\" but continued \"the conduct of the Japanese army as a whole in Nanjing was a blot on the reputation of their country\".\"Ralph L. Phillips, a missionary, testified to the U.S. State Assembly Investigating Committee, that he was \"forced to watch while the Japs disembowled a Chinese soldier\" and \"roasted his heart and liver and ate them.\"\n\n\n=== Theft and arson ===\nOne-third of the city was destroyed as a result of arson. According to reports, Japanese troops torched newly built government buildings as well as the homes of many civilians. There was considerable destruction to areas outside the city walls. Soldiers pillaged from the poor and the wealthy alike. The lack of resistance from Chinese troops and civilians in Nanjing meant that the Japanese soldiers were free to divide up the city's valuables as they saw fit. This resulted in the widespread looting and burglary.On 17 December, chairman John Rabe wrote a complaint to Kiyoshi Fukui, second secretary of the Japanese Embassy. The following is an excerpt:\n\nIn other words, on the 13th when your troops entered the city, we had nearly all the civilian population gathered in a Zone in which there had been very little destruction by stray shells and no looting by Chinese soldiers even in full retreat.\u2026 All 27 Occidentals in the city at that time and our Chinese population were totally surprised by the reign of robbery, raping and killing initiated by your soldiers on the 14th. All we are asking in our protest is that you restore order among your troops and get the normal city life going as soon as possible. In the latter process we are glad to cooperate in any way we can. But even last night between 8 and 9 p.m. when five Occidental members of our staff and Committee toured the Zone to observe conditions, we did not find any single Japanese patrol either in the Zone or at the entrances! \n\n\n=== Nanjing Safety Zone and the role of foreigners ===\nThe Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; until the Japanese occupation, no shells entered that part of the city except a few stray shots. During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that occurred in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts.Rabe wrote that, from time to time, the Japanese would enter the Safety Zone at will, carry off a few hundred men and women, and either summarily execute them or rape and then kill them.By February 5, 1938, the International Committee had forwarded to the Japanese embassy a total of 450 cases of murder, rape, and general disorder by Japanese soldiers that had been reported after the American, British and German diplomats had returned to their embassies:\n\"Case 5 \u2013 On the night of December 14th, there were many cases of Japanese soldiers entering houses and raping women or taking them away. This created panic in the area and hundreds of women moved into the Ginling College campus yesterday.\"\n\"Case 10 \u2013 On the night of December 15th, a number of Japanese soldiers entered the University of Nanjing buildings at Tao Yuen and raped 30 women on the spot, some by six men.\"\n\"Case 13 \u2013 December 18, 4 p.m., at No. 18 I Ho Lu, Japanese soldiers wanted a man's cigarette case and when he hesitated, one of the soldier crashed in the side of his head with a bayonet. The man is now at the University Hospital and is not expected to live.\"\n\"Case 14 \u2013 On December 16, seven girls (ages ranged from 16 to 21) were taken away from the Military College. Five returned. Each girl was raped six or seven times daily- reported December 18th.\"\n\"Case 15 \u2013 There are about 540 refugees crowded in No. 83 and 85 on Canton Road.\u2026 More than 30 women and girls have been raped. The women and children are crying all nights. Conditions inside the compound are worse than we can describe. Please give us help.\"\n\"Case 16 \u2013 A Chinese girl named Loh, who, with her mother and brother, was living in one of the Refugee Centers in the Refugee Zone, was shot through the head and killed by a Japanese soldier. The girl was 14 years old. The incident occurred near the Kuling Ssu, a noted temple on the border of the Refugee zone ...\"\n\"Case 19 \u2013 January 30th, about 5 p.m. Mr. Sone (of the Nanjing Theological Seminary) was greeted by several hundred women pleading with him that they would not have to go home on February 4th. They said it was no use going home they might just as well be killed for staying at the camp as to be raped, robbed or killed at home.\u2026 One old woman 62 years old went home near Hansimen and Japanese soldiers came at night and wanted to rape her. She said she was too old. So the soldiers rammed a stick up her. But she survived to come back.\"It is said that Rabe rescued between 200,000 and 250,000 Chinese people.\n\n\n=== Causes ===\nJonathan Spence writes:[T]here is no obvious explanation for this grim event, nor can one be found. The Japanese soldiers, who had expected easy victory, instead had been fighting hard for months and had taken infinitely higher casualties than anticipated. They were bored, angry, frustrated, tired. The Chinese women were undefended, their menfolk powerless or absent. The war, still undeclared, had no clear-cut goal or purpose. Perhaps all Chinese, regardless of sex or age, seemed marked out as victims.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Matsui's reaction to the massacre ==\nOn December 18, 1937, as General Iwane Matsui began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed. He reportedly told one of his civilian aides:I now realize that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed. I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory.\u2026 I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents. Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people.On New Year's Day, over a toast he confided to a Japanese diplomat: \"My men have done something very wrong and extremely regrettable.\"\n\n\n== End of the massacre ==\nIn late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have \"restored order\". After the establishment of the weixin zhengfu (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanjing and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably.\nOn 18 February 1938, the Nanjing Safety Zone International Committee was forcibly renamed \"Nanking International Rescue Committee\", and the Safety Zone effectively ceased to function. The last refugee camps were closed in May 1938.\n\n\n== Recall of Matsui and Asaka ==\nIn February 1938, both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan. Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945. He was promoted to the rank of general in August 1939, though he held no further military commands.\n\n\n== Death toll estimates ==\n\nEstimates of the number of victims vary based on the definitions of the geographical range and the duration of the event.\nThe extent of the atrocities is debated, with numbers ranging from some Japanese claims of several hundred, to the Chinese claim of a non-combatant death toll of 300,000. Historian Tokushi Kasahara states \"more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more\", referring to his own book. This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanjing, which is objected to by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p. 146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes \"more than 200,000\" in his book. Tomio Hora writes of 50,000\u2013100,000 deaths.Mainstream scholars consider figures from 40,000 to over 300,000 to be an accurate estimate. According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, estimates made at a later date indicate that the total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanjing and its vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was up to 200,000. These estimates are borne out by the figures of burial societies and other organizations, which testify to over 155,000 buried bodies. These figures also do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning, drowning or other means, or whose bodies were interred in mass graves.According to the verdict of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal on 10 March 1947, there are \"more than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof. Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organizations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.\" However, this estimate includes an accusation that the Japanese Army murdered 57,418 Chinese POWs at Mufushan, though the latest research indicates that between 4,000 and 20,000 were massacred, and it also includes the 112,266 corpses allegedly buried by the Chongshantang, a charitable association, though today mainstream historians agree that the Chongshantang's records were at least greatly exaggerated if not entirely fabricated. Bob Wakabayashi concludes from this that estimates of over 200,000 are not credible. Ikuhiko Hata considers the number 300,000 to be a \"symbolic figure\" representative of China's wartime suffering and not a figure to be taken literally.Some researchers estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people were killed, which corresponds to the figures from three sources; one is the Red Army's official journal of the time, Hangdibao and another is that of Miner Searle Bates of the International Safety Zone Committee, and the third is the aforementioned figure written by John Rabe in a letter. John Rabe, Chairman of the International Committee and Nanjing Safety Zone, estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 (civilians) were killed. However, Erwin Wickert, the editor of The diaries of John Rabe, points out that \"It is likely that Rabe's estimate is too low, since he could not have had an overview of the entire municipal area during the period of the worst atrocities. Moreover, many troops of captured Chinese soldiers were led out of the city and down to the Yangtze, where they were summarily executed. But, as noted, no one actually counted the dead.\"\n\nThe casualty count of 300,000 was first promulgated in January 1938 by Harold Timperley, a journalist in China during the Japanese invasion, based on reports from contemporary eyewitnesses. Other sources, including Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking, also conclude that the death toll reached 300,000. In December 2007, newly declassified U.S. government archive documents revealed that a telegraph by the U.S. ambassador to Germany in Berlin sent one day after the Japanese army occupied Nanjing, stated that he heard the Japanese ambassador in Germany boasting that the Japanese army had killed 500,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing. According to the archives research \"The telegrams sent by the U.S. diplomats [in Berlin] pointed to the massacre of an estimated half a million people in Shanghai, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Wuxi and Changzhou\".In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed.\n\n\n=== Range and duration ===\nThe most conservative viewpoint is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few km2 of the city known as the Safety Zone, where the civilians gathered after the invasion. Many Japanese historians have insisted that during the Japanese invasion there were only 200,000\u2013250,000 citizens in Nanjing as reported by John Rabe, to argue that the PRC's estimate of 300,000 deaths is an exaggeration.\nMany historians include a much larger area around the city. Including the Xiaguan district (the suburbs north of Nanjing, about 31 km2 in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city, the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just before the Japanese occupation. Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality.\nThe duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanjing. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks. Historians who define the Nanjing Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered Jiangsu province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and stretch the end of the massacre to late March 1938.\nTo many Japanese scholars, post-war estimations were distorted by \"victor's justice\", when Japan was condemned as the sole aggressor. They believed the 300,000 toll typified a \"Chinese-style exaggeration\" with disregard for evidence. Yet, in China, this figure has come to symbolize the justice, legality, and authority of the post-war trials condemning Japan as the aggressor.\n\n\n=== Various estimates ===\nJapanese historians, depending on their definition of the geographical and time duration of the killings, give wide-ranging estimates for the number of massacred civilians, from several thousand to upwards of 200,000. The lowest estimate by a Japanese historian is 40,000.Chinese language newspapers tend to claim that the massacred civilians and unarmed soldiers may be as high as 200,000.\n\n\n=== 200,000 Nanjing population debate ===\nJapanese sources assert that there was a population of only 200,000 in Nanjing, thus making the 300,000 death toll impossible. In 2003, Zhang Lianhong, professor of Nanjing Massacre Research Center in Nanjing Normal University, published an article in the Beijing Daily in which he used historical facts to show that the population of Nanjing urban area was between 367,000 and 467,000, and the overall Nanjing population was between 535,000 and 635,000, to refute the assertion of a population of 200,000.\n\n\n== War crimes tribunals ==\nShortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanjing were put on trial. General Matsui was indicted before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for \"deliberately and recklessly\" ignoring his legal duty \"to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches\" of the Hague Convention. Hisao Tani, the lieutenant general of the 6th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army in Nanjing, was tried by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\nOther Japanese military leaders in charge at the time of the Nanjing Massacre were not tried. Prince Kan'in Kotohito, chief of staff of the Imperial Japanese Army during the massacre, had died before the end of the war in May 1945. Prince Asaka was granted immunity because of his status as a member of the imperial family. Isamu Ch\u014d, the aide to Prince Asaka, and whom some historians believe issued the \"kill all captives\" memo, had committed suicide during the Battle of Okinawa.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Grant of immunity to Prince Asaka ===\nOn May 1, 1946, SCAP officials interrogated Prince Asaka, who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal. Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops.\n\n\n=== Evidence and testimony ===\n\nThe prosecution began the Nanjing phase of its case in July 1946. Dr. Robert O. Wilson, a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone, took the witness stand first. Other members of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone who took the witness stand included Miner Searle Bates and John Magee. George A. Fitch, Lewis S. C. Smythe, and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters.\nAnother piece of evidence that was submitted to the tribunal was Harold Timperley's telegram regarding the Nanjing Massacre which had been intercepted and decoded by the Americans on January 17, 1938. One of the books by Hs\u00fc, Documents of the Nanjing Safety Zone, was also adduced in court.\nThe entry for the same day in Matsui's diary read, \"I could only feel sadness and responsibility today, which has been overwhelmingly piercing my heart. This is caused by the Army's misbehaviors after the fall of Nanjing and failure to proceed with the autonomous government and other political plans.\"\n\n\n=== Matsui's defense ===\nMatsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese POWs. He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives. At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect Prince Asaka by shifting blame to lower ranking division commanders.\n\n\n=== Verdict ===\nK\u014dki Hirota, who had been the Foreign Minister when Japan conquered Nanjing, was convicted of participating in \"the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy\" (count 1), waging \"a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China\" (count 27) and count 55. Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the \"orgy of crime\" at Nanjing because, \"He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors.\"\n\nOrganized and wholesale murder of male civilians was conducted with the apparent sanction of the commanders on the pretext that Chinese soldiers had removed their uniforms and were mingling with the population. Groups of Chinese civilians were formed, bound with their hands behind their backs, and marched outside the walls of the city where they were killed in groups by machine gun fire and with bayonets. --- From Judgment of the International Military Tribunal\n\n\n=== Sentence ===\nOn November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging. Eighteen others received lesser sentences. The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence.General Hisao Tani was sentenced to death by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nIn 1985, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built by the Nanjing Municipal Government in remembrance of the victims and to raise awareness of the Nanjing Massacre. It is located near a site where thousands of bodies were buried, called the \"pit of ten thousand corpses\" (w\u00e0n r\u00e9n k\u0113ng). As of December 2016, there are total 10,615 Nanjing Massacre victim names inscribed on a memorial wall.\nIn 1995, Daniel Kwan held a photograph exhibit in Los Angeles titled, \"The Forgotten Holocaust\".\nIn 2005, John Rabe's former residence in Nanjing was renovated and now accommodates the \"John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\", which opened in 2006.\nOn December 13, 2009, both the Chinese and Japanese monks held religious assembly to mourn Chinese civilians killed by invading Japanese troops.\nOn December 13, 2014, China held its first Nanjing Massacre memorial day.On October 9, 2015, Documents of Nanjing Massacre have been listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nChina and Japan have both acknowledged the occurrence of wartime atrocities. Disputes over the historical portrayal of these events continue to cause tensions between Japan on one side and China and other East Asian countries on the other side.\n\n\n=== Cold War ===\nBefore the 1970s, China did relatively little to draw attention to the Nanjing massacre. In her book Rape of Nanking, Iris Chang asserted that the politics of the Cold War encouraged Chairman Mao to stay relatively silent about Nanjing in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan.\n\n\n=== Debate in Japan ===\nThe debate concerning the massacre took place mainly in the 1970s. During this time, the Chinese government's statements about the event were attacked by the Japanese because they were said to rely too heavily on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence. Aspersions were cast regarding the authenticity and accuracy of burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court, which the Japanese government claimed were fabrications by the Chinese government, artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanjing Massacre.During the 1970s, Katsuichi Honda wrote a series of articles for the Asahi Shimbun on war crimes committed by Japanese soldiers during World War II (such as the Nanjing Massacre). The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from Japanese right-wingers regarding the Japanese treatment of the war crimes. In response, Shichihei Yamamoto and Akira Suzuki wrote two controversial yet influential articles which sparked the Japanese Negationist movement.In 1984, in an attempt to refute the allegations of war crimes in Nanjing, the Japanese Army Veterans Association (Kaikosha) interviewed former Japanese soldiers who had served in the Nanjing area from 1937 to 1938. Instead of refuting the allegations, the interviewed veterans confirmed that a massacre had taken place and openly described and admitted to taking part in the atrocities. The results of the survey were published in the association's magazine, Kaiko, in 1985 along with an admission and apology that read, \"Whatever the severity of war or special circumstances of war psychology, we just lose words faced with this mass illegal killing. As those who are related to the prewar military, we simply apologize deeply to the people of China. It was truly a regrettable act of barbarity.\"\n\n\n=== Apology and condolences by the Prime Minister and Emperor of Japan ===\n\nOn August 15, 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the Surrender of Japan, the Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama gave the first formal apology for Japanese actions during the war.\nHe offered his apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims. That day, the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor Akihito pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan. Iris Chang, author of The Rape of Nanking, criticized Murayama for not providing the written apology that had been expected. She said that the people of China \"don't believe that an... unequivocal and sincere apology has ever been made by Japan to China\" and that a written apology from Japan would send a better message to the international community.\n\n\n=== Denials of the massacre by public officials in Japan ===\n\nIn May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanjing Massacre a \"fabrication\".On June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers. They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a \"political advertisement\".On February 20, 2012, Takashi Kawamura, mayor of Nagoya, told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre \"probably never happened\". Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, \"Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people.\" On April 1, 2013, Kawamura said his position remained unchanged when the issue came up during an election debate.On February 24, 2012, Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara said that he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened. He reportedly claims it would have been impossible to kill so many people in such a short period of time. He believes the actual death toll was 10,000.On February 3, 2014, Naoki Hyakuta, a member of the board of governors of Japan's public broadcasting company, NHK, was quoted as saying the massacre never occurred. He said that there were isolated incidents of brutality but no widespread atrocity, and criticized the Tokyo Trials figure of 200,000.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Effect on international relations ===\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations since the early 1970s. Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually. Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust and animosity toward Japan that originates from the memory of Japanese war crimes such as the Nanjing Massacre. This sense of mistrust is strengthened by the belief that Japan is unwilling to admit to and apologize for the atrocities.Takashi Yoshida described how changing political concerns and perceptions of the \"national interest\" in Japan, China, and the U.S. have shaped collective memory of the Nanjing massacre. Yoshida contended that over time the event has acquired different meanings to different people. People from mainland China saw themselves as the victims. For Japan, it was a question they needed to answer, but were reluctant to do so because they too identified themselves as victims after the A-bombs. The U.S., which served as the melting pot of cultures and is home to descendants of members of both of Chinese and Japanese cultures, took up the mantle of investigator for the victimized Chinese. Yoshida has argued that the Nanjing Massacre has figured in the attempts of all three nations as they work to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.Many Japanese prime ministers have visited the Yasukuni Shrine, a shrine for Japanese war deaths up until the end of the Second World War, which includes war criminals that were involved in the Nanjing Massacre. In the museum adjacent to the shrine, a panel informs visitors that there was no massacre in Nanjing, but that Chinese soldiers in plain clothes were \"dealt with severely\". In 2006 former Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi made a pilgrimage to the shrine despite warnings from China and South Korea. His decision to visit the shrine regardless sparked international outrage. Although Koizumi denied that he was trying to glorify war or historical Japanese militarism, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Koizumi of \"wrecking the political foundations of China-Japan relations\". An official from South Korea said they would summon the Tokyo ambassador to protest.\n\n\n=== As a component of national identity ===\nYoshida asserts that \"Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\"\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nIn Japan, the Nanjing Massacre touches upon national identity and notions of \"pride, honor and shame\". Yoshida argues that \"Nanking crystallizes a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or ... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression.\" Recognizing the Nanjing Massacre as such can be viewed in some circles in Japan as \"Japan bashing\" (in the case of foreigners) or \"self-flagellation\" (in the case of Japanese).The government of Japan believes it can not be denied that the killing of a large number of noncombatants, looting and other acts by the Japanese army occurred. However, the actual number of victims is hard to determine, according to government of Japan. In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed. The range of the death toll estimated by Japanese historians is from tens of thousands to 200,000.According to a brief reference to Nanjing at the Yasukuni museum in Tokyo, the Japanese general in charge gave his men maps showing foreign settlements and a civilian \"safety zone\", and ordered them to maintain strict military discipline. The visitor is left to assume they did. The museum notes only that \"Chinese soldiers disguised in civilian clothes, which numbered around 4000 were severely prosecuted\".\nThis nationalist view does not, however, represent a widely shared understanding of what happened at Nanjing, as illustrated by Japanese textbooks' rather different treatment of the atrocity. While the books' take on Nanjing is stilted and feels like the product of a committee, in various versions they acknowledge the deaths of thousands of Chinese including women and children, as well as looting, arson and assaults by Japanese soldiers. They do not mention sexual assaults.\n\"During this period, when the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing it killed a large number of Chinese and carried out looting, arson and assaults. In regard to the number of victims of this Nanjing Massacre ... the Tokyo (War Crime) Trials later found it in excess of 200,000, and prosecuted Japan's responsibility severely\", reads one Japanese textbook.Another history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which had been approved by the government in 2001, attempts to whitewash Japan's war record during the 1930s and early 1940s. It referred to the Nanjing massacre as an \"incident\", and glossed over the issue of comfort women. Indeed, there is only one sentence that refers to this event: \"they [the Japanese troops] occupied that city in December.\"\n\n\n=== China ===\nThe Nanjing massacre has emerged as one fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity.

        "wiki": "The Presidential Palace in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, housed the Office of the President of the Republic of China since 1927 until the capital was relocated to Taipei in 1949. It is now a museum called the China Modern History Museum. It is located at No.292 Changjiang Road (formerly Lin Sen Road), in the Xuanwu District of Nanjing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ming and Qing era ===\n\nIn the Ming Dynasty, this house was to the west of the Ming Palace, built by a duke. In the Qing dynasty, it became the Office of the Viceroy of Two Lower Yangtze Provinces, the chief government official in charge of what is today Jiangsu, Shanghai, Anhui and Jiangxi. When Qianlong visited the Lower Yangtze, he chose this office to be the detached palace together with the Imperial Silk House. Today, \"Daxinggong\" (lit. the Great Detached Palace) Station of Nanjing Metro Line 2 is named after it.\nIn 1853, Taiping Rebellion forces led by Hong Xiuquan occupied Nanjing. The palace was expanded and converted into a luxurious palace for Hong, called the Palace of the Heavenly King, or the Celestial Palace.\nIn 1864, Qing imperial forces re-took Nanjing. Commander Zeng Guofan ordered to destroy most of the palace by fire. He had a new palatial residence in 1870 and later imposing government buildings for the Qing Governor-General erected in the Neoclassical style, and in accordance with contemporary protocol.\n\n\n=== Presidential Palace ===\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Sun Yat-sen was sworn in at the former Governor-General's palace, now the \"Provisional Presidential Palace\", as the provisional President of the Republic of China. He kept offices here for a while.\nHowever, China soon fell into the post-revolution Warlord era, and the Palace was not officially used by the Republic of China until 1927, when the Northern Expedition of Kuomintang (KMT) captured Nanjing. As the Nationalist Government, they transformed the Presidential Palace and adjacent buildings into the Headquarters of the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China. Premier Chiang Kai-shek had his office in the palace.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), Chiang Kai-shek's government fled to Chungking, and the Headquarters was occupied by Wang Jingwei, who collaborated with the invading Japanese. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government reoccupied the Headquarters\u2014Presidential Palace for governing the Republic of China. In 1947, the Constitution of the Republic of China was promulgated. and the \"Headquarters of the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China\" was renamed the \"Presidential Palace.\"\nIn April 1949, near the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Communist forces captured Nanjing and the Presidential Palace. Chiang Kai-shek's government fled to Taipei, Taiwan and Chairman Mao Zedong declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China with capital in Beijing on 1 October 1949. The Presidential Palace building was then used for Jiangsu Provincial Government and functions of the Presidential Palace were moved to Presidential Office Building in Taipei.\n\n\n=== Museum ===\nIn the late 1980s the former Presidential Palace was transformed into the China Modern History Museum, a history museum exclusively about the 20th century history of modern China, about the history of the Republic of China (1912-1949) and the history of the People's Republic of China.\nIn 2005, the Kuomintang Chairperson Lien Chan visited the museum in the Presidential Palace on his trip to Mainland China, marking a symbolic return of the party to the Palace for the first time in 58 years.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nLocated in the capital city of the Republic of China, Presidential Palace is an important historical landmark in Nanjing and one of the largest surviving complex of modern Chinese (1840-1949) buildings. It mainly consists of the central axis, the west garden and the east garden. The current structures were mainly built between 1870 and 1930s.\n\n\n=== Central Axis ===\n\n\n==== Main Gate ====\n\nIt was the site of the main gate of the Viceroy's Office. During the period of Taiping Rebellion, it became the site of the Gate of True God's Glorious Light, the main gate of the Heavenly King's Palace, which was destroyed soon after the imperial troops captured the palace. In 1870, the gate was rebuilt as the main gate of the viceroy's office, and demolished when the NRA captured Nanjing in 1927.\nThe current gate, rebuilt in 1929, was a western-style gate with ionic columns. Two stone lions stood on the both sides of the gate. As the HQ of the Nationalist Government, the sign on the gate read \"\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\" (Nationalist Government) from 1929 to 1937 and from 1946 to 1948. During the Japanese occupation of Nanking, it served as the main gate of Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan of the Wang Jingwei regime. After the constitutionalism and the presidential election in 1948, the sign changed into \"\u7e3d\u7d71\u5e9c\" (Presidential Palace) until now. Nowadays, it is not only a significant symbol in downtown Nanjing, but also served as the main entrance to the Presidential Palace.\n\n\n==== Main Hall ====\n\nJust located at the north of the main gate, the main hall is the first hall of the Viceroy's Palace. It was rebuilt in 1870 on the original site of the Supreme Hall of the Glorious Light, the most luxurious hall of the Heavenly King's Palace during the period of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. It was the place where the viceroy or the Heavenly King held the ceremonies. In January 1912, the inauguration ceremony of the Provisional President was held in the \"Warm Pavilion\" just on the northwest side of the main hall. From 1927, it was used for government functions by the Nationalist Government and the Office of the President.\nThe main hall is a traditional Chinese-style hall. At the top of the hall, there is a board on which the four Chinese characters \"\u5929\u4e0b\u70ba\u516c\" (\"What is under heaven is for all\") was written by Dr Sun Yat-sen. Behind the main hall there is a corridor which connects it to the second hall. On the west of the corridor stands the auditorium, which was built on the ruins of the \"Warm Pavilion\". Heavenly King's Throne Room is located on the east side of the corridor.\n\n\n==== Second Hall ====\nThe second hall, also known as the central hall, rebuilt in the late 19th century, was the site of the Heavenly King's inner court. During the period of the Nationalist Government, some minor ceremonies were held in the hall. There is an aisle that lead the visitors to the reception hall.\n\n\n==== Reception Hall ====\n\nAlso known as the \"\u516b\u5b57\u5ef0\" (literally \"Hall of Character 'Eight'\"), the western-style reception hall of the Presidential Palace was built in 1917 by Feng Guozhang, Vice President of the Republic of China at that time. After the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, it became the reception rooms for the civil and foreign guests of the Nationalist Government. Before the Chinese Civil War began, Some negotiations between CPC and KMT were signed in this hall. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek, Lin Sen and Li Tsung-jen also rested here before the ceremonies began frequently. President Chiang Kai-shek occasionally worked here instead of the Presidential Building.\nThe Kirin Gate is a red gate situated on the north of the reception hall. This gate would open only if the president went through this place. The gate leads to the House of the Government Affairs, the original office building of the Chairman of the Nationalist Government.\n\n\n==== House of the Government Affairs ====\n\nThe House of the Government Affairs, also known as the House of the Government Officials and the House of Documentary Affairs, was built in 1925 by Sun Chuanfang. Originally served as the Kiangsu military governor's office, it became the office building of the Chairman and other officials of the Nationalist Government from 1928 to 1935. As Chiang Kai-shek was the chairman from 1928 to 1931, there was a room in the second floor that once served as Chiang's office.\nFrom 1946 to 1949, this house was converted into the House of the Government Affairs. The Ministry of the Government Affairs mainly dealt with the works of writing articles and checking confidential documents. Chen Bulei, an official of the government held the house as his office. Today, the house is served as the Museum of the President and the Vice President, with some collections from the Nationalist Government. Out of the house, there is a courtyard that leads to the Presidential Building, one of the most important buildings in the palace complex.\n\n\n==== Presidential Building ====\n\nThe Presidential Building, also known as \"Zichao House\" and the Concrete House, was one of the most important buildings in the complex. Situated on the northernmost part in the palace, the six-storey house with the structure of reinforced concrete was one of the tallest buildings in Nanking in the 1930s. The construction started in 1934, and finished in December 1935. Lin Sen used this house as the office of Chairman of the Nationalist Government until the Japanese troops captured Nanking. From 1940 to 1945, this Japanese-occupied house was converted into the office of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan of the Reorganized National Government. In 1946, Chiang's Nationalist Government re-took Nanking, then used this house as the office of the Nationalist Government for the second time. After the presidential inauguration ceremony in 1948, it became the seat of the president of the ROC. In April 1949, the People's Liberation Army took control of this house. The house lost the position of the president's seat from then on. From December 1949, the Presidential Office Building of Taipei has become the seat of the ROC president. In Mainland China, Zhongnanhai became the seat of the central government and the official residence of the Leader of the Communist Party of China since October 1949.\nTwo cedars were planted in 1934 by Chairman Lin Sen on both sides of the courtyard in the front of the Presidential Building. The cedar on the east side was dead in 2005 and was cut down in 2013. The building was designed by Yu Binglie, who was the head of the department of architecture, National Central University. Inside the house, the first floor was served as the office of the Secretary-General to the President, the highest-ranking official in the Office of the President who supervised the staff of the Office. The presidential office and vice presidential office were both on the second floor. The meeting room of the State Affair Council was located on the third floor.\n\n\n===== Presidential Office =====\n\nThe Presidential Office was the office of the president of the ROC since 20 May 1948. It is also known as the Office of Chiang Kai-shek because Chiang was the only president who used this as the presidential office. Situated on the southeast corner of the second floor, it composed of three rooms. The middle one was served as the principal working place of the president. Inside the middle room, a huge secretaire was put sideways next to the window, with a French-made droplight above. And above the brown couch, a huge photograph of Chiang was hung on the side wall. There was an Otis elevator near the office, but Chiang Kai-shek seldom used it. Although President Chiang Kai-shek wasn't working here all the time, this office is still one of the most popular sites for the visitors in the Presidential Palace.\n\n\n===== Vice Presidential Office =====\n\nThe vice presidential office lied opposite the presidential office, also known as Li Tsung-jen's office. As well as the presidential office, it was served as the office of the vice president since 20 May 1948. But the relationship between Li Tsung-jen and Chiang Kai-shek was not very good, so the vice president usually worked in his residence in Gulou District instead of this office to avoid meeting Chiang.\n\n\n===== State Affairs Council Room =====\nDuring the period of the Nationalist Government, the State Affairs Council usually dealt with the domestic affairs such as the publication of laws and orders, and the appointment of officials. The State Affairs Council Room was situated on the third floor of the Presidential Building. In the northern wall of this room, a horizontal board inscribed with \"fidelity, filialness, benevolence, kindness, good faith, calm and peace\" written by Lin Sen, the chairman of the Nationalist Government in 1935. On the desk, a glass bottle was put on the northernmost side except for numerous teacups. According to the relevant record, the bottle belonged to Chiang Kai-shek because unlike others' habit, he liked drinking water rather than tea.\n\n\n=== The West Garden ===\n\nThe West Garden, also called Xu Garden, is a classical southern Chinese garden located just on the west of the Presidential Palace's central axis, which was considered as the finest work of the gardens in Nanjing together with Zhanyuan Garden. Centered on the Taiping Lake (literally \"Pacific Lake\"), Various pavilions and attics built in the 1870s, including the Marble Boat, the Paulownia Melody House, the Tower of Beautiful Sunset, the Ripples Pavilion, the Palm Pavilion, the Mandarin Duck Pavilion, the Provinsional President's Living Room and the Attic of Joy are all located on the shore of the lake.\n\n\n==== The Marble Boat ====\nThe Marble Boat is the oldest surviving structure in the Presidential Palace complex, which was built when Qianlong visited Kiangning. To please the emperor, the official told him that the name of the structure was called the \"unmoored boat\", as the metaphor of the firmness of the Qing dynasty's regime. The 14.5-meter-long timber-mimic stony boat is one of the best-known structures in the garden.\n\n\n==== Attic of Joy ====\nThe Attic of Joy, alternatively called the Pavilion that Forgetting to Fly and the Waterside Pavilion, was rebuilt in 1870 on the eastern lakeside of the garden. The government official once worked here were surprised at the attractive view and believed that \"if the birds saw the view here, they would have so much joy that they could forget how to fly\". That was the origin of the name. In the 1930s, this attic once served as one of the offices of the Military Affairs Commission, one of the most powerful organizations in Nationalist China.\n\n\n==== General Staff House ====\nThe General Staff House was built in 1935, which was the seat of Ho Ying-chin, the General Staff of the Nationalist Government. Its function now is the exhibition hall of the theme \"Sun Yat-sen and the Provisional Government in Nanjing\".\n\n\n==== Commission House ====\nThe Commission House, variously called the West Garden Hall and the Office of the Provisional President, was built in 1909 by Duanfang, the 80th Viceroy of Liangjiang, who visited Europe just before the construction started. The construction finished in 1910, during the period of Zhang Renjun, the last Viceroy of Liangjiang. From 1 January 1912, the house was used as the office of the provisional president by Sun Yat-sen, thus becoming one of the birthplace of the Republic of China. The first cabinet council of the provisional government was held in the house as well. Since 1927, the house was served as the seat of the Military Affairs Commission, which grasped the real power of the Nationalist Government. Today this yellow house is also a popular tourist attraction in the Presidential Palace.\n\n\n=== The East Garden ===\n\nThe East Garden, also known as the Restored Garden, was the additional garden of the viceroy's office. During the period of Taiping Rebellion, it became the east garden of the Celestial Palace. After the troops of Qing dynasty captured the palace, the east garden was totally destroyed. When the Nationalist Government came to Nanjing, some minor office buildings attached to the Executive Yuan were built on the site, which were all demolished in the 2000s. In 2003, the garden was partly rebuilt according to the historical information. Some other buildings, like the warehouse, were rebuilt at the same time.\nThe Executive Houses, the seat of the Executive Yuan from 1928 to 1937 were located on the north side of the garden.\n\n\n==== Executive Houses ====\n\nThe Executive Houses were the seat of the Executive Yuan from 1928 to 1937. In November 1937, the Executive Yuan was moved to the city of Chungking. The houses were served as the offices of Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Transportation and Communication in the period of Wang Jingwei regime and later served as the seat of Ministry of Social Affairs and Ministry of Water Conservancy.\nThe Executive Houses were divided into two blocks. The North Executive House, also known as the North Block of the Executive Yuan Building, mainly housed the office of the Premier from 1928 to 1934 until the South Executive House was finished working. The South Executive House, also known as the South Block of the Executive Yuan Building, mainly housed the office from 1934 to 1937 until the Nationalists lost Nanking and fled to Chungking. Premiers including Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Kung Hsiang-hsi and Soong Tse-ven once worked in the premier's office in the South Block.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe building is accessible within walking distance north of Daxinggong station of Nanjing Metro.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in China\nMing Palace\nZhongnanhai\nPresidential Office Building, Taipei\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChina Modern History Museum\nPresidential Palace, from Nanjing city government",

          "In my opinion, this place offers a great opportunity to learn Nanjing's history, which is quite important since Nanjing was used to be China's capital before. This place is a presidential palace, government workplace, and also museum at the same time. We can see the office of",

          "We found this place overrated. It was crowded, and nothing special from an architectural point of view. The place is a maze with poor directions, all in Chinese. Gardens are just so-so and lots of steps and places to step over. Many pathways are not smooth. Not so suitable for",
          "This was a nice way to spend an hour or so. Like most tourist areas in China there was heavy dose of propaganda, but what else is new. I visited in between meetings on a weekday so the crowds were pretty reasonable, but it looked like a complete madhouse outside when I drove by",
          "To be fair, this should be rated as average (3 points) for many people. I give it four points because I learnt the past which I knew little of by visiting there. China has a long history, and the part of history that I really dislike is the recent 100 years for some obvious",

          "Admission fee is 40 RMB At first, when you enter, you will think it is one big building. But it continues on to the back, then to both sides and it kept going and going. It has a pavilion, library, a pond, gardens, intricate stoned pavement with various designs, even a bunker",
          "We went to see this Palace to learn about the Peoples Party and the life of Dr. Sun Yat Sen who can be considered the father of China. The palace is made of several buildings and the garden is very well laid out. The Palace was used by the Qing dynasty but finally used by Sun",

          "Cost of the entrance is about RMB40 and can be easily reach my Nanjing Metro. Its crowded and the best is to visit in the morning to avoid many people. China mainland tourist usually will not get up so early and start travelling according to my obervation. Very nice garden and",
          "My friend and I visited on an extremely rainy day so he were surprised to see the amount of people that showed up despite the bad weather. Due to the excessive pushing and the rain, we only toured 1/4 of the palace before we decided we needed to get out. The garden is a very",
          "Come here only if you have no where else to go in Nanjing. This is a very significant place to visit as it has a enormous historical value. However note that you will be very disappointed by the bad maintenance of the place. Its a bit dirty, displays introductions have bad",
          "This Palace is actually a large collection of buildings and gardens. It's very well kept and it's architecture reminded me of old British colonial style. The gardens are beautiful and immaculately kept. The Presidents Office is very small and nice to say you've seen it but not",
          "Firstly, the name is a bit confusing, it should probably be called presidential complex. It is a series of government buildings from which the Republican government was run in the 1900s, and now it is a museum for that period in history. For whatever reason you have come to",
          "This is an interesting place but probably more significant to Chinese tourists. It certainly has history and if I knew more about the country's history and political issues around the 1940s and 50s it could have been more interesting. However I have studied some Chinese",
          "This was one of my favourite parts of my trip. The museum sections often (not always) have some English but more importantly the exhibits are well laid out, interesting and varied. The buildings are beautiful as well. My top tip, get a map from the tourist centre on your right",
          "If we had charged 5 RMB for every time someone came up to us in the Presidential Palace asking to take a photo with \"the Westerners,\" we would have been rich by the time we left. We wanted to see classic Ming gardens which surround the palace. There's a stone boat, much",
          "I loved this place. I spent 4 hours here. I felt like I was in the time period of the palace. Wonderful experience. Great artifacts, pictures and descriptions.",
          "This is worth a trip because of the different \"histories\" present in one place as well as the different architectural styles. However, if it is crowded (e.g., around a Chinese holiday) it is very hard to enjoy. Gift shops are nice. When you buy tickets and enter the place,",
          "This is worth seeing. We went on one of the busiest days of the year - May 1. That meant that the place thronged with people. Nevertheless there was little delay entering and plenty of paths and places to walk that it was not too uncomfortable. Board walks and pathways abound.",
          "The Presidential Palace is quite impressive and contains history from many different eras of Chinese history. There are quite a few information panels (more than in most Chinese historic sites I've visited) explaining certain things and people. The grounds are really nice,",
          "Was in a bit of a rush, so didn't get the chance to fully explore. Found some of the rooms had English translations and many didn't. And the level of detail in many of the translations were minimal (according to my Chinese wife) - but this is still better than many sites fin",

          "Visited back in Nov 2012 when it wasn't too hot, I liked our national father Dr. Sun Zhong Shan's Palace! You can find the candle/wax figurines in one of the chambers here. The main building has three floors that represent the 1912-1930s time when Dr. Sun Zhong Shan was working",

          "The number of visitors currently in the palace grounds is displayed at the entrance - we were there with well under a thousand others , and thoroughly enjoyed three hours in grounds and buildings . A friend who lives locally told us that there are sometimes ten times as many",
          "The palace is important for the collective memory of Chinese people, as it refers to their post-imperial decades. The explanation in English was good, but at the information desk is was very poor. We had this experience everywhere in this town.",
          "I had the luxury of visiting with a couple of local colleagues from Nanjing. There was a great mix of both some older architecture, as well as a look into more modern (pre-Mao/revolution) buildings, as well as to some insight into the government prior to the change over to",
          "Huge structure where u can understand china history and importance for authorities..loved it the structure of the building snd composing of the palace",
          "The palace was covered in a landmark and have too many blocks. Did explained everything about the end of dynasty and the modern China. Respect those who have relentlessly make the utmost effort to changed China",

          "The Presidential Palace, although with roots going back centuries, today has been established as a museum predominantly to highlight the 20th Century history of government in China. With such a complex history across provinces, with various international 'interests' knocking at",
          "The string of buildings and corridor along the main axis look pretty modern. But as you explore the side wings, the architecture gives way to traditional courtyards, decorated wall partitions, living quarter of concubine. Wrapped around the compound perimeter are the gardens.",
          "Caught the subway there. Had a nice couple of hours wandering around. An interesting photo display on China's history with English captions. Couple of pretty ponds. Our young kids enjoyed playing amongst the rock gardens otherwise they were mostly bored. Entry cost is 40rmb",
          "Really enjoyed this landmark - the rooms are as they were at the foundation of the Republic of China and also the older emperor's throne rooms and gardens. We had so much fun at the shops and the photo studio too.",
          "in this place you can see many moments of the history of nanjing. the main building is very old and smell bad. there are not explanations in english for everything interesting place to visit if you have time",
          "This isn't really a luxurious palace (as in it's not plated with gold or platinum or whatever) but it still holds great historical value. And I emphasize 'historical' because history is the main part of this attraction (in other words, if you don't at least have a general idea",
          "Long walk and can spend all day there - some food can be bought - but bring your own. This is great for pictures, but can not use the camera inside some of the buildings. There is no short-cut out of the park - lots of walking. Nice place. (I do not remember dates - I think it",
          "Terrific gardens, spectacular when the plum blossoms are in bloom. Otherwise just mysterious nooks and crannies, and photos of puh bah of the past. Easy to access, on Metro Line 2, Daqinggong stop. Just a block from the Nanjing Library and a major expat supermarket, Carrefour.",
          "Although it was difficult to make much progress through the grounds and buildings of the Palace, due to Spring Festival crowds, this was an interesting place for me as the Palace contained so much historical material from the early days of the changes that took place in China",
          "Huge place that you may need spend half a day. Entry fee is cny40 per person. The ticket is a postcard with 80cent stamp. Nice place to visit but lack of English wording.",
          "This is where the Nationalist government of China held office before they were forced to flee to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War. It's a nice, big place where you can see the office of Chiang Kai Shek and others. Also, you can see where government officials greeting",
          "I didn't imagine that such place could be so nice. The gardens are amazing, calmed and very good to spend an afternoon there. The high number of rooms to visit, the architechture and the buildings in general are excellent... it worths the 40 RMB of entrance!",
          "It's easy to find it. It's next to 1912 and opposite the Nanjing Library. And it can be reached by metro so that saves you a lot of money on taxis, or time lost being stuck in traffic jams. I would not rate it as highly as other places like Yuhuatai, Confucius Temple or the",
          "At 90,000 sq.metres this is the largest modern history museum in China. Set in garden landscape dotted with open halls, pavilions, bridges, trees, terraces and provides an insight into over 600 years of history. Nanjing's position as capital of Southern China and its role",
          "This is an excellent live review of the seat of the nationalist government which ruled China from 1911 until 1949. You are in the very rooms and halls where power resided and momentous decisions were made about China. While some English explanations are offered the context",
          "A period of history that I for one am not very familiar with, covering the transformation from the Kingdom of Heaven into the People's Republic. Lots of artifacts, some of which have english explanations, but many not. But just too many people to get a good view and a serious",
          "Located next door to the popular eating and socialising area of 1912 and near the Daxingong Metro this is a \"must do\" site if you are in the city for a couple of days. Pleasant gardens and the familiar marble boat, there is lots of history to digest too. Anyone who was anybody",
          "This is recent history stuff many foreigners will remember. Beautiful home on an island filled as it was in 1949 when Chiang Kai Shek and the ROC left the country to Taiwan",
          "Another mansion and garden complex...Nothing amazing. A bit lacklustre if you've been to Beijing and other sights. I'll give it a miss. The gardens are not that beautiful either.",

          "This place represent part of China's history. The park surrounding the place is actually really nice and charming. The palace itself is not so special, unless you are Chinese or your a passionate historian. There are tons of interesting a historic room used for several purpose",
          "Once upon a time the seat of power in China, this is a monument to an ideal that so many Chinese people believe in - \u5929\u4e0b\u4e3a\u516c. I was awed to be in that complex. Perhaps, as the day of reconciliation approaches, the leaders of KMT would once again be allowed home.",
          "This place is quite huge, and one can easily spend a couple hours just walking around. Didn't research the history beforehand, so I wasn't really able to appreciate the stuff I was seeing. The rooms were interesting at first, but after a while all started to look the same. I did",
          "It may be because I've visited a good handful of other sites in China to compare with, but this one left me with little impression. I'm also not a huge history buff, so perhaps this was my fault. The palace was so-so, the park attached was alright, but in the end, I was ready to",
          "This is easily a couple of hours visit. There are lots of different buildings, temple areas and gardens to visit. Most parts are with English signs too. I was oblivious that Nanjing was capital of China for some parts of 20th century, so this place certainly filled in some gaps.",
          "Again, it is the sense of living history that dominates a visit here, with the many large photographs and mannequins of figures who were important in the development of the republic nearly a century ago. Wonderful architecture and again, superb gardens. The city really",
          "I am a history teacher and enjoyed my visit tremendously. You should plan to spend a half-day here or even more if you are going to read all of the displays. If you are not interested in modern Chinese history then you may not want to come here.",
          "It has a pretty garden, the building and exhibits are ok but nothing too exciting and it quite expensive but if you have time go visit but don't make this a priority unless you love the history and politics.",
          "This was a surprisingly interesting museum; we real enjoyed our visit. Very good value for 55 Y. Make sure you give yourself time to see it all and walk in the pleasant, fragrant gardens. Oh, and just outside there is a sort of heritage-themed History site where, if you need",
          "It is a nice place to visit if you are interested in history; however, it does not compare to The Forbidden City. During my visit lines were short and the attraction wasn't too busy. Most of the property serves as a museum. Unfortunately, if you cannot read many Mandarin",
          "I think the palace is worth a quick breeze through and linger in the parks if you so desire. The parks in the Presidential Palace are nice and relatively well-maintained. There are lots of nice photo opportunities. There are many exhibits within the Palace itself, all in",
          "can be interesting only for fans of Mr Sun Yat Sen:) architecture has nothing outstanding - the park - you'd better visit Xuan Wu Lake - also we were really disappointed by the fact despite the signs - the place has everything for disabled people - it isn't . we could reach only",
          "If you have an idea of Chinese and Nanjing history then this is very interesting to add perspective and depth to the knowledge. There are no big famous or expensive things to see but a large collection of buildings of different ages, photos and lovely lakes and gardens to walk",
          "Potentially interesting place to learn the more modern history of China. Much of it is preserved as it was occupied in the the late 30s. Unfortunately, the lack of English captions on most exhibits made much of it uninterpretable. I was hoping to learn more about the Japanese",
          "The palace is great and impressive if it's the first, or the only, one you see while in China. It wasn't the first one I saw so overall the wind was taken from it sail. However, there is still a ton of neat things to see and is a nice break from walking the busy streets. Worth",
          "Interesting to see some of the older buildings in the city since so much of it seems to have been destroyed in the 1900s. Well worth a visit. Many rooms to view and a small garden on the property is worth a visit.",
          "Nanjing was China's capital for long periods of time, but in the last couple of decades the city has done away with its historic neighborhoods, which makes Presidential Palace all the more essential to visit. The most represented part of history is Nanjing's time as the seat of",
          "Very enjoyable pleasant. Real 'China'. Spend time basking in the gardens, and viewing the little lakes. Could do with a bit more TLC and maintenance on the area. Quite crowded outside and may get haggled. Very touristy destination. Possible more and better things to do. Student",
          "I would have liked some more information about the history in English. It was important to see this important part of history and what happened when the Japanese were there.",
          "In this historic city, this place is a must visit to get a handful glimpse of chinese history. For me, that already learn a bit about chinese history since I was little, from the story that my father told me, it did bring back those childhood memory of my time with dad. Most of",
          "Didn't think this was anything special. Some of the buildings were just rooms with tables and chairs in them with no other props. Seeing old offices was OK. Gardens were small. I think you need to be into recent Chinese history to appreciate a visit. Would have probably",

          "We travelled to Nanjing on CRT train from Bengbu. The Presidential Palace is different in that it deals with more recent history of China. A typical Chinese tourist destination with many tour groups but well worth the effort. Within easy walking distance from city centre and",

          "Very interesting with plenty of local history! A guide would help with an explanation the history of the palace.",
          "I thought this place would be boring, but it wasn't. I had been reading about Sun Zhong Shan and Jiang Jie Shi, the Taiping Rebellion, the Nationalists and Communists and so on so it was great to see photos of meetings and furniture and settings of the time. Helped in",
          "It's a pity that everything is only in Chinese. In addition its very very crowded.",
          "We didn't join a tour, so I needed to read the fine details to know the stories of the exhibit! Since I am interested in history, it was an impressive place! There were lots of people and we needed to sit down a few times before moving on to cover the whole place. It took us",

        "wiki": "Nanjing University (NJU or NU, sometimes Nanking University, simplified Chinese: \u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b66; traditional Chinese: \u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78; pinyin: N\u00e1nj\u012bng D\u00e0xu\u00e9, N\u00e1nk\u012bng T\u00e0hs\u00fc\u00e9h), known as Nanda (\u5357\u5927; N\u00e1nd\u00e0), is a major public university, the oldest institution of higher learning in Nanjing, Jiangsu, and a member of the elite C9 League of Chinese universities.\nEstablished in 1902 as Sanjiang Normal School, it underwent a number of name changes until it was renamed Nanjing University in 1950. It merged with the University of Nanking in 1952.In addition to its membership in the C9 League, Nanjing University has been designated a Class A institution in the Double First Class University plan, a government initiative to cultivate an elite group of Chinese universities into \"world-class\" institutions. The university is perennially ranked one of the best research universities in China, and one of China's most selective universities. It is ranked among the top universities worldwide in major global university rankings. Regarding research output, the Nature Index 2017 ranks Nanjing University number 2 in China, number 3 in Asia Pacific and number 12 in the world.NJU has two main campuses: the Xianlin campus in the northeast of Nanjing, and the Gulou campus in the city center of Nanjing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nNanjing, situated in the lower part of the Yangtze, has historically been the capital of various kingdoms and dynasties, with the reputation as the center of education. In 258 CE, the Kingdom of Wu under the reign of Emperor Jing of Wu, founded a Confucian learning institute for the purpose of learning Six Arts. In the first year of Jianwu reign (317), Taihsueh (\u592a\u5b78) campus was built in today's Fuzimiao (\u592b\u5b50\u5edf) area on the banks of Qinhuai River, and Nanking Imperial University began recruiting students from common families instead of only from noble families. Like its forerunner Chengjun (\u6210\u5747) and succeeding Shang Hsiang (\u4e0a\u5ea0) founded by Yu (\u79b9, 21st century BCE) in Chungyuan, the earliest recorded imperial higher learning institutions and their successors, it was the Kingdom's central university, which after Han dynasty excellent students from local schools could be selected to attend to pursue further education.\nIn 470 during the Former Song dynasty, the Imperial Central University (Zongmingguan) became a comprehensive institution combining higher education and research, with five divisions: Literature, History, Confucian Study, Xuan Study and Yin Yang Study. The campus of School of Literature and School of History were located in today's Nanjing University Gulou campus, west to Gulou (\u9f13\u6a13) mountain, and the campus was moved to today's Chaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bae) area at the time when Wang Jian (\u738b\u5109) was university president and the areas of study were narrowed, with a heavy focus on Confucian classics. In the period the faculty members included such scholars and scientists as Zu Chongzhi (\u7956\u6c96\u4e4b), Ge Hong (\u845b\u6d2a), Wang Xizhi (\u738b\u7fb2\u4e4b), and students included such figures as Xiao Daocheng, Emperor Gao of Southern Qi who studied at School of Confucian Studies, and Zhong Rong, a founding scholar of poetics who graduated from division of literature. After the fall of Chen dynasty, the school was closed and later replaced by Nanking Academy (or Jiangzhou Academy, Jiangzhou Zhouxue) in Sui dynasty.\nIn 937 when campus of the imperial national university was again in Fuzimiao area, Li Shandao, a scholar of the university, established another national school Lushan National Academy outside the capital city Nanking which is called Bailudong Shuyuan (White Deer Grotto Academy), a famous academy that hosted many renowned scholars including Zhu Xi, Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming.\nIn 1382 the Imperial University (\u570b\u5b50\u76e3 Kuotzuchien or Guozijian) moved campus from Nanking Fuzimiao area to south of Qintian Mountain (\u6b3d\u5929\u5c71) and Xuanwu Lake (the area around Nanjing University campus before 1952. In 1952 Nanjing University moved to Gulou and its engineering school was split and formed several independent colleges including Nanjing Institute of Technology, which at its peak spanning 10 Li and hosting near 10,000 students, and around there were institutes including Qintian Jian (Imperial Astronomy Institute) and Taiyi Yuan (Imperial Medical Institute). In 1403 Peking Guozijian (Beijing Guozijian, Imperial University of Peking) was established. The Imperial University of Nanking (\u5357\u4eac\u570b\u5b50\u76e3) developed and flourished in the period, consisting of six schools: three basic level colleges (Chengyi, ChongChih, Guangye), two middle level schools (Hsiudao, Chenghsin) and one advanced level school (Shuaihsing), altogether 4 years to complete according to the system, one and a half years for both of the former two levels and one year for the latter level, to achieve 8 credit points a year and then upon graduation Chushen (qualification, diploma) would be awarded, with subjects including Confucian classics, history, literature, mathematics, law, calligraphy, equestrianism and archery, etc. Yongle Encyclopedia was completed at Imperial Nanking University in 1408 after five years compilation, 9169 scholars selected from nationwide took part in it, thereinto 2180 were student scholars of the university. The publishing house of the imperial university of Nanking had been a publishing centre for several hundred years. Wu Cheng'en, Tang Hsiantzu and Zheng Chenggong studied there during the Ming dynasty.\nEach time when Nanking became a non-capital city, the Nanking Imperial University was changed to be regional Nanking Academy. The Imperial Nanking University was changed to Nanking Academy (\u6c5f\u5be7\u5e9c\u5b78, Jiangning Fuxue) in 1650 after Qing dynasty replaced Ming dynasty, and in 1865 after Taiping Rebellion the academy was relocated to Chaotian Palace. The ancient school history was recognized during ROC. In 1954 the school authority controlled by CPC decided to set the year starting to establish the modern new type school Sanjiang Normal College as the school's new founding year.\n\n\n=== Late Qing and Republic of China ===\n\nIn 1902, Sanjiang Normal College (\u4e09\u6c5f\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u5802) under the new educational system, using Japanese modern higher institutions of learning as references, was beginning to be established to replace the traditional Chinese school Nanking Academy, and was opened in the next year, with campus constructed south to Qintian Mountain. The name was changed to Liangjiang Normal College (\u5169\u6c5f\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u5802) in 1906, and the new president Li Ruiqing (\u674e\u745e\u6e05) established the first faculty of modern art in China.\nIn 1915 after the Republic of China replaced Qing dynasty, the Nanking Higher Normal School (\u5357\u4eac\u9ad8\u7b49\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u6821) was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed three years before due to Xinhai Revolution, Jiang Qian (\u6c5f\u8b19) was appointed as the president. The school established the China's first faculty of modern gymnastics (physical education) in 1916. In 1920 the school consisted of five colleges: Liberal Arts, Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce and Education.\nThe \"China Science Society\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u793e), a major science organization in the modern history of China, founded its headquarter in the school in 1918. Its members established \"Academia Sinica\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u7814\u7a76\u9662) which was later moved to Taiwan and known as the \"Chinese Academy of Sciences\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u9662) in mainland China. Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in America and some European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China. It became the Chinese cradle of modern science. Among 81 academicians of \"Academia Sinica\" elected for the first time in 1948, five entered or graduated from the university in 1920. More than half of the leading Chinese scientists whose works were published in scientific journals in the early period of Chinese modern science were graduates or academics of Nanjing University.\nKuo Ping-wen (Guo Bingwen, \u90ed\u79c9\u6587), an influential university president, was appointed in 1919 after Jiang Qian. The school meeting passed The Audit Law for Women Students (\u300a\u898f\u5b9a\u5973\u5b50\u65c1\u807d\u6cd5\u6848\u300b) on December 7, 1919, as result of efforts of the educationist T'ao Hsing-chih (Tao Xingzhi, \u9676\u884c\u77e5), as well as the president Guo Bingwen, and the professors including Liu Boming (\u5289\u4f2f\u660e), Luh Chih-wei (Lu Zhiwei, \u9678\u5fd7\u5049), Yang Hsingfo (Yang Xingfo, \u694a\u674f\u4f5b), etc., and then decided to formally recruit female students. The school became the first higher learning institution in China to recruit coeducational students. It enrolled eight women students in the first year 1920, and in addition, more than 50 female auditing students were admitted.\nIn 1921 the National Southeastern University (\u570b\u7acb\u6771\u5357\u5927\u5b78) was founded, and in 1923 Nanking Higher Normal School was merged into it. In the autumn of 1921, the Faculty of Business established in 1917 was moved to Shanghai to establish the first business school conferring degrees in China. The university consisted of five colleges (or schools) at the time: Liberal Arts (including departments of Chinese literature, foreign literature, history, philosophy, psychology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geoscience, and the Department of Politics, Law and Economics), Education, Agriculture, Engineering, and Commerce (or Business, including departments of general commerce, business administration, accounting, finance, economics, international trade, etc.), and soon later the College of Liberal Arts was divided to be College of Humanities and College of Sciences. The earliest modern scientific research laboratories and groups in China were established at the university. It integrated teaching and research, with status of university's independence and academic freedom, and was regarded as the earliest Chinese modern university. The university along with its affiliated primary school and middle school served as a pioneer and model which laid the foundations for the establishment of modern educational system (\u58ec\u620c\u5b78\u5236, Renhs\u00fc Hs\u00fcehchih, 1922) in China, and in addition, its experimental kindergarten (Gulou Kindergarten) founded in 1923 was later also adopted as the model for Chinese kindergartens (Kindergarten Courses Standards by Ministration of Education, 1932), including its teaching system, teaching materials, teaching methods and teaching tools. In October 1921, \"Hsuehheng Society\" (or Xueheng Society, \u5b78\u8861\u793e) was founded in the university which was the focus of the \"Hsuehheng School\" included the scholars Liu Yizheng (\u67f3\u8a52\u5fb5), Liu Boming (\u5289\u4f2f\u660e), Mei Guangdi (\u6885\u5149\u8fea), Wu Mi (\u5433\u5b93) and Hu Hsien-Hsu (Hu Xiansu, \u80e1\u5148\u9a4c). They reinvigorated Confucian culture and humanism and published the monthly \"Critical Review\" (Xueheng, \u5b78\u8861 in Chinese) in January 1922. It enabled Nanjing University to become a center of Confucian thought and humanistic scholarship. During this period, Nanjing University was known as the foremost \"Oriental Education Centre\" and recognized as an academic and cultural exchange centre for east and west. Many scholars visited and instructed there, including the American educationist Paul Monroe, W. H. Kilpatrick, E. L. Thorndike, philosopher John Dewey, British philosopher Bertrand Russell, German philosopher Hans Driesch and the Indian (also Bengali) poet Rabindranath Tagore.\nThe university became the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital by Nationalist Government, initially renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (or called National Nanking Chungshan University) in June 1927 when National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province, and was renamed Jiangsu University in February 1928, and in May 1928, it was renamed National Central University (\u570b\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u5b78). At the time there were eight colleges (or schools): Humanity, Social Science, Natural Science, Engineering, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, and Medicine. The College of Commerce moved to Shanghai in 1921 and College of Medicine established in Shanghai in 1927 were split from the university in 1932. In 1935 College of Medicine was again established, in Nanjing. During the Anti-Japanese War between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to Chongqing, while the College of Medicine and Department of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Medicine of College of Agriculture moved to Chengdu. The Chinese Association of Natural Science (\u4e2d\u83ef\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b78\u793e) was originated at the university in 1927 and adopted the name next year, which was the second largest scientific organization in China in 1949, after China Science Society. China Association of Scientific Workers (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5354\u6703) was founded in the university in 1944. China Science Society and the associations were merged to be the China Association for Science and Technology (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u6280\u8853\u5354\u6703) in 1958 in Beijing. The Natural Science Forum was initiated by the university faculties in 1939, which was later renamed Jiusan Forum (Sept. 3rd Forum) and became Jiusan Society in 1945, an organization for intellectual groups in China.  In the united college entrance examinations beginning in 1937, about two-thirds of students put the university as the first choice. It became the first Chinese university enrolling blind college student, when enrolled Luo Fuxin (\u7f85\u798f\u946b) in 1942.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nIn 1949, during the late time of Chinese Civil War, the central government of the Republic of China retreated from Nanking and the National Central University was renamed National Nanking University (National Nanjing University, \u570b\u7acb\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78) after Nanking was controlled by CPC army, before the establishment of People's Republic of China. In 1952, many colleges and departments, mainly colleges of education (or teacher, normal, including art and physical education departments), engineering, agriculture, and medicine, were split from Nanjing University, and many new independent schools were formed, including Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing Institute of Technology which was located at former Nanjing University site and later renamed Southeast University, etc. At the same time, University of Nanking (\u91d1\u9675\u5927\u5b78), a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into Nanjing University (\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78), which lost its \"national\" appellation in 1950 to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was west to Gulou Mountain and was also once the site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times. A separate National Central University was reinstated in Taiwan by its old alumni association in 1962.\n\nDuring the period of communist society including the period of Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the school suffered heavily. In 1976, Nanjing University faculty members and students launched Anti Cultural Revolution Force Movement which was called \"Nanjing Incident\" by the authorities of the time, spreading countrywide. In 1978, Hu Fuming, a faculty member of Nanjing University in philosophy, wrote the historic article entitled \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth\", and after being published it led to the nationwide \"Debate on Standards for Judging the Truth\", and thus in certain degree liberated thought and promoted the ending of Cultural Revolution and the coming of reform era.\n\n\n=== After the Reform and new development ===\nMany faculties have been reestablished or newly founded since the Reform after 1978, e.g., law reestablished in 1981, medical school in 1987, environmental department newly founded in 1984. Some departments were divided into two or more departments, e.g., the Chinese language and literature department divided into departments of language & linguistics, literature, philology and drama arts, or some new faculties came out of older faculties, e.g., computer came out of mathematics, urban planning came out of geography, in many case formed integratively, i.e., formed based on parts of two or more faculties, e.g., parts of faculties of physics and chemistry integratively formed material faculty. In around 1990 the university consisted of schools (colleges) of Humanities, Sciences, Technological Sciences, Medicine, Business, etc.. Then many departments became schools, e.g., mathematics, physics, chemistry, or grouped into new schools, e.g., architecture and urban planning. The size of university significantly expanded during the years.\nIn 2009, Xianlin Campus opened to undergraduates, replacing Pukou Campus which was in use since 1993, and Pukou Campus became the campus of NJU Jinling College, an independent private college directed by NJU. The Xianlin campus now is a main campus along with Gulou campus.\n\n\n== Faculties ==\n\nMore than 1500 years ago, ancient University of Nanjing founded the earliest faculties of literature, history, etc.. In modern times, Nanjing University established Chinese first faculties of art, gymnastics, biology, psychology, business management, etc.. Its faculties, departments and schools have been changed and evolved timely. For example, in 1921, the university consisted of 5 schools: liberal arts, education, agriculture, engineering and business, in 1928 the school of liberal arts had become three schools, and the university consisted of 8 schools: humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, agriculture, engineering, business and medicine, and now, many former departments of humanities, natural sciences and social sciences have become schools.\nThe system of academic degree or diploma has also been changed. In the early years of ROC the university adopted the system similar to western especially American universities and began to award bachelor's degree. The university founded China's first modern laboratories in physics, chemistry, etc.. In 1922, the university professors founded The Biology Research Institute of Science Society of China, the first modern scientific research institute in China, integrated with the university's biology department. With the aid of Rockefeller Foundation, Science Centre was constructed in 1924 and completed three years later. In 1926 the university passed The General Regulation of Graduate Institute. China's first doctor's degree was awarded by the school of medicine of the university in 1931. Soon the educational system was changed. In the early 1980s after a period of transformation, universities in mainland China resumed to award doctor's degrees, and graduate and undergraduate education were integrated into departments and schools. Nanjing University is the first in mainland China to award doctor's degrees in such fields as Chinese studies, world history, computer science.\nIt is distinguished in many fields including Chinese Language and Literature, and natural sciences.\nIts faculty, including part-time faculty, includes more than twenty Nobel Laureates engaged in teaching.\nThe university is a Double First Class University Plan university in 15 academic disciplines.\n\n\n=== Schools and departments ===\n\nCurrent schools and departments\n\nSchool of Liberal Arts (School of Literature, or College of Literature)\nChinese Language and Linguistics; Literature; Philology; Drama Arts\nSchool of History\nChinese History; World History; Archaeology\nDepartment of Philosophy; Religion\nSchool of Foreign Studies\nEnglish; Russian; Japanese; French; German; Spanish; Korean; International Business\nSchool of Government\nPolitics; Government Administration; Labor, Personnel and Social Security; Diplomacy and International Affairs\nSchool of Law\nSchool of Social and Behavioral Sciences\nSociology; Social Work and Social Policy; Psychology; Anthropology (institute)\nSchool of Business (NUBS)\nSchool of Management: Business Administration; Human Resource; Accounting; Marketing & Electronic Commerce\nSchool of Economics: Economics; Industrial Economics; International Economics & Trading; Finance\nDepartment of Information Management\nSchool of Journalism and Communication\nDepartment of Mathematics\nSchool of Physics\nPhysics; Modern Physics; Photoelectricity Science; Acoustic Science and Engineering\nSchool of Astronomy and Space Science\nAstronomy; Space Science\nSchool of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\nChemistry; Chemical Engineering; Polymer\nSchool of Geoscience\nSchool of Atmosphere Science: Meteorology; Atmosphere Physics\nSchool of Earth Science and Engineering: Earth Science; Water Science; Geology Engineering and Information Technology\nSchool of Geography and Ocean Science: Natural Geography; Land, Resources and Tourism;  Earth Information Science; Coast and Ocean Science\nSchool of Life Sciences\nBiology; Biochemistry\nSchool of Medicine\nClinical Medicine; Dentistry; Basic Medical Science; Laboratory Medicine; Public Health and Medicine (institute)\nSchool of Environment\nSchool of Architecture and Planning\nArchitecture; Urban Planning and Design\nSchool of Electronics Science and Engineering\nElectronic Engineering; Micro-electronics and Optoelectronics; Informational Electronics; Communication Engineering\nDepartment of Computer Science and Technology; Software Institute\nCollege of Engineering and Applied Sciences\nMaterials; Energy; Quantum Electronics and Optical Engineering; Biomedical Engineering\nInstitute of Education (Graduate School of Education)\nInstitute for Gymnastics\nInstitute of Arts\nInstitute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Science\nSchool for Basic Sciences Education\nInternational School\nSchool for Overseas Students Education\nJinling College(First-class applied college)\nJohns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center)\nOther research and education institutes in areas such as African Studies, Judaic Studies, Agriculture, Engineering Management, etc.\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nNanjing University has three main campuses: Gulou, Xianlin and Pukou campus. The distance between Gulou and Xianlin campus is about 18 kilometers.\nGulou Campus is located in Gulou District, at the center of Nanjing City. The main campus itself is divided into two sections by Hankou Road: North Garden, Bei Yuan, is where teaching and research take place; and South Garden, Nan Yuan, serves as the living area for both students and academic staff.\nPukou Campus is situated in the suburban Pukou District, by the northern side of Nanjing New & High-Tech Industry Development Zone, and became part of Nanjing University in 1993. Once Pukou campus hosted undergraduate freshmen, sophomore and junior students. In 2009, the Pukou campus became the campus hosted the undergraduate students in Nanjing University Jinling College, which was founded by Nanjing University in 1998. Nanjing University Biomedical Research Institute is also located in Pukou.\nXianlin Campus is located in the northeast of Nanjing, in the Xianlin Universities Town, south of Yangtse River and Qixia Mountain, east of Purple Mountain, and west of Baohua Mountain. The campus is home to undergraduate students and parts of graduate students. It was opened in September 2009. There is the stop of Nanjing University Xianlin Campus on Line 2 of Nanjing Subway, which enables Xianlin and Gulou campus to be connected through subway.\nIn Gulou campus, there are several museums including Nanjing University Museum, Museum of Art and Archaeology, Museum of Earth Science. There is Sun Yat-sen House. It's said that Sun Yat-sen, the first president (provisional president) of the Republic of China, lived there. There are also Pearl Buck House, John Rabe House, etc.. Gulou campus is now becoming mainly for professional graduate campus.\nThe location of Nanjing University has changed for several times, with historical campuses mainly in Fuzimiao (on the bank of Qinhuai River), Gulou, Chaotiangong and Sipailou (south of Qintian Mountain) areas. In addition, during Anti-Japanese War, its main campus moved to Shapingba, Chungking, with two auxiliary campuses, one in Bohsi, Chungking, and one in Hwahsiba, Chengdu, in some sense combined with Chongqing University and Western China University (now medical school of Sichuan University) respectively. It also deserves to mention that before the war, with the rapid development of the university, a new campus planned to cover an area of 8000 mu (about 5.3 km2 or 2.0 sq mi) south to Niushou Mountain in the southern suburb area of Nanjing had been built for near a year. After the war, it moved back to Nanjing, making former campus Sipailou as main campus, and the new campus Dingjiaqiao was built for agriculture and medical schools. Nanjing University relocated in Gulou six years after moving back, and then near sixty years later Xianlin campus emerged. Today's Nanjing University Gulou campus is the location of Imperial University of Nanjing during Former Song dynasty in more than 1500 years ago when it was in the west of the city, and now it's in the centre of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Motto ===\nOfficially translated into English as \"Sincerity with Aspiration, Perseverance and Integrity\". Another version is \"Be Honest and Intelligent, Study Hard and Act Sincerely.\"(simplified Chinese: \u8bda\u6734\u96c4\u4f1f \u52b1\u5b66\u6566\u884c; traditional Chinese: \u8aa0\u6a38\u96c4\u5049 \u52f5\u5b78\u6566\u884c; pinyin: ch\u00e9ng p\u01d4 xi\u00f3ng w\u011bi l\u00ec xu\u00e9 d\u016bn x\u00edng)\nThe first half of this motto was the motto during the National Central University time, and the last half was quoted from the classic literature work Book of Rites. It was voted to be the motto by university students in 2002, and the then university president supported it and wrote an article to interpret it.The translation does not fully express the meaning of the Chinese words of the motto. Motto counterparts between Chinese and English literally: Cheng (\u8bda, Sincerity, Honesty, Integrity), Pu (\u6a38, Simplicity, Austerity, naturally being oneself), Xiong (\u96c4, Sturdiness, Majesty, being vigorous and keeping ideal and ambition, being firm and persistent with fortitude), Wei (\u5049, Greatness, having great ideal and ambition, with great mind comprehending, containing and improving world), Li Xue (\u52f5\u5b78, Endeavor to Learn), Dun Xing (\u6566\u884c, Urge to Act, Act Sincerely). The term Dun Xing comes from the context in Book of Rites: Having broad knowledge and strong learning ability and being modest, acting in sincerity and benignity and not slack, that is a gentleman (gentleperson) (\u535a\u805e\u5f37\u8b58\u800c\u8b93 \u6566\u5584\u884c\u800c\u4e0d\u6020 \u8b02\u4e4b\u541b\u5b50).\n\n\n=== Song ===\nThe university song, recovered in 2002, was created in 1916. It is the first school song in the modern history of Nanjing University, with the lyrics written by Jiang Qian and melody composed by Li Shutong (\u674e\u53d4\u540c).\n\n\n=== Anniversary ===\nThe present school anniversary is on May 20 every year, which was set by the school authority in 1954 in some sense due to some ideological reasons of the time, with the starting year being 1902 when relaunching the school as a modern higher learning institution, and the day May 20 in memory of the movement of anti-hunger and anti-war initiated by the university in that day of 1947. In recent years, the date May 20 has another new meaning: in Chinese Nanjing pronunciation, 5.20, sounds like I Love You (Wu Ai Ni). It shows students' love for their Alma Mater.\n\n\n== Recent status ==\n\n\n=== Recent developments and present status ===\nThe School of Modern Engineering and Applied Sciences was established in 2009, replacing former School of Technological Sciences. NU received a RMB 400 million endowment gift from enterpriser Yang Xiu on the anniversary day in 2012, 300 million was designated for the establishment of engineering school and the rest for history study development fund. The Engineering Building covering floor space of 6000 sqm was started to construct in Xianlin campus in 2014.\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\nAccording to Nature Index released in January 2018, the ranking of high-quality natural sciences research by Nature Publishing Group, Nanjing University is ranked No.3 in China, No.4 in Asia Pacific, No.14 in the world among all institutions (including CAS in China, CNRS in France and other national organizations), and ranked No.2 in China, No.3 in Asia Pacific, and No.10 in the world among universities.Nanjing University was ranked 91-100 for World Reputation Ranking in 2017 by Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and 114 by 2015 QS World University Rankings.It's ranked 7th in China by ShanghaiRanking in 2018.Reviewing rankings, domestically, according to university rankings in China, Nanjing University was generally ranked among the top 3 universities before the university merger tide occurred in the several years about after 2000, and then ranking down, even falling to No.7. Chinese university ranking by Chinese Academy of Management Science since 1995 ranked Nanjing University between 1st and 3rd before 2000 and since then between 3rd and 6th. Chinese university ranking since 1999 by the higher education publisher Netbig consistently ranked the university among the top 3 before 2005, and in the most recent ranking among the top 5. Academic Ranking of World Universities since 2003 by Shanghai Jiaotong University (ShanghaiRanking) suggested a domestic rank of number 2 to number 7. The first-time integrative ranking of universities in China, in 1989, ranked Nanda as the No.1 comprehensive university.\n\n\n== Admissions ==\n\n\n=== Most selective university status ===\nKnown for its stringent admission criteria, Nanjing University was reported by national media to be the No. 1 most selective university (\"the university that is the hardest to get in\") in mainland China.\n\n\n=== Overseas students ===\nIn 2012, 667 new students from abroad attended Nanking University, among them about 20% from USA, 22% from Britain, France, Germany and Italy and the rest from other countries. In 2013 Nanda recruited 761 overseas students from 61 countries. In 2014, there were about 3600 overseas students, about 40% from Asia, 40% from Europe and North America, and 20% from other regions.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Chinese language and literature ===\nNanjing University has a long history in the field of Chinese language and literature. The School of Literature founded by Hsieh Yuan in the 15th year of Yuanjia reign (CE 438) was the oldest literature school in ancient China. In modern times, it was the first in mainland China to have granted a doctoral degree in Chinese Language and Literature. In addition, Nanjing University is in close cooperation with the United Nations to offer a Chinese language programme. Widely recognized as one of the most eminently prestigious Schools of Chinese in the world, it was ranked with Peking University as Joint No. 1 in Chinese Language and Literature. Peking University and Nanjing University are widely recognized in the academic community as the two top universities in the field of Chinese Language and Literature in the world, with both consistently taking the two top places in rankings on the subject. [Nanjing University] had produced modern China's first PhD in Chinese Language and Literature, Dr. Mo Lifeng (\u83ab\u783a\u950b), who is still serving as its Professor of Chinese.\n\n\n=== Western literature ===\nNanjing University established the first department of Western literature among Chinese universities, in 1921. Two years later the department was merged with English department and other faculties including French and German and renamed department of foreign languages and literature, later known as school of foreign studies.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Ming Xiaoling (Chinese: \u660e\u5b5d\u9675; pinyin: M\u00edng Xi\u00e0o L\u00edng; lit.: 'Filial mausoleum of Ming') is the mausoleum of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming dynasty. It lies at the southern foot of Purple Mountain, located east of the historical centre of Nanjing. Legend says that in order to prevent robbery of the tomb, 13 identical processions of funeral troops started from 13 city gates to obscure the real burying site.The construction of the mausoleum began during the Hongwu Emperor's life in 1381 and ended in 1405, during the reign of his son the Yongle Emperor, with a huge expenditure of resources involving 100,000 labourers. The original wall of the mausoleum was more than 22.5 kilometres long. The mausoleum was built under heavy guard of 5,000 troops.\n\n\n== Layout and monuments ==\n\n\n=== Great golden gate and Square city ===\nDa Jin Men and Sifangcheng. One enters the site through the monumental Great Golden Gates (Da Jin Men), and is soon faced by a giant stone tortoise (bixi), which resides in the Sifangcheng (\"Square city\") pavilion. The tortoise supports a splendid carved stone stele, crowned by intertwining hornless dragons. The  well-preserved stele is known as the \"Shengong Shengde Stele\" (\u795e\u529f\u5723\u5fb7\u7891), i.e., literally, \"The Stele of Godly Merit and Saintly Virtue\". The inscription of the stele, extolling the merits and virtues of the  Hongwu Emperor Hongwu Emperor was written by his fourth son, the Yongle Emperor. The tortoise is 5.15 m long, 2.54 m wide and 2.8 m tall,\nthe stele stands 8.78 m tall (including the tortoise) and is one of the best-known examples of its genre.\nIt is thought that originally the Yongle Emperor planned to install a much bigger stele here. The work on making it was started in the Yangshan Quarry (some 10 km east of the mausoleum) in 1405, but the unfinished stele was abandoned in the quarry, as it was realized that it would not be possible to move it.Unlike the similar pavilion at the Ming Tombs near Beijing, Nanjing's  Sifangcheng does not have its roof anymore, as it was destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion. Recently, Chinese engineers have conducted research in regard to the possibility of restoring the roof.\n\n\n=== The Sacred Way ===\nThe Sacred Way is an  1800-metre-long road at the Nanjing city Government site. The winding Sacred Way (Shendao) starts near the Sifangcheng pavilion. It includes several sections: the Elephant Road and the Wengzhong Road. The Elephant Road is lined by 12 pairs of 6 kinds of animals (lions, xiezhi, camels, elephants,\nqilin, and horses), guarding the tomb. Beyond them is a column called huabiao in Chinese. One then continues along the Wengzhong Road. Four pairs of ministers and generals (or warrior guardian figures, wengzhong) of stone have been standing there for centuries to guard the journey to the after life.\n\n\n=== Lingxing Gate ===\nThe Lingxing Gate, a pailou at the end of the Wengzhong Road was destroyed long ago, but rebuilt in 2006.\n\n\n=== The central area ===\nOne enters the central area of the mausoleum complex through the Wen Wu Fang Men (The Gate of the Civil and the Military). \nOn an inscribed stone tablet outside of the gate is an official notification of the local government in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) is ordered to protect the tomb. Inside the gate, there the Tablet Hall (Bei Dian)  in which 5 steles stand. The one in the middle, also mounted on a stone tortoise, is inscribed with 4 Chinese characters, \"\u6cbb\u9686\u5510\u5b8b\", which were written by the Qing dynasty's Kangxi Emperor on his third inspection tour of the South in 1699. The text is interpreted as alluding to the greatness of the Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang, matching (or surpassing) that of the founders of the Tang and Song Dynasties of old.Behind the pavilion, there used to be other annexes; however most of them have collapsed into relics from which the original splendor can still be traced. The emperor and his queen were buried in a clay tumulus, 400 metres in diameter, known as the Lone Dragon Hill (Du Long Fu). A stone wall with a terrace on top, known as Ming Lou (Ming Mansion) or the Soul Tower is half-embedded into the front face of the tumulus. On a stone wall surrounding the vault, 7 Chinese characters were inscribed, identifying the mausoleum of Emperor Ming Taizu (respected title of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang).\nThe mountain to the south of the tomb, known as Meihua Shan (\"Plum Flower Mountain\"),  is the mausoleum of Sun Quan, King of the Kingdom of Wu in the Three Kingdoms period (220-265). The existence of this tomb is the reason why the Sacred Way is not straight.\n\n\n== Later history ==\nThe mausoleum complex suffered damage during the mid-19th century Taiping Civil War, but was restored during the Tongzhi era thereafter.\nAlong with the Ming Tombs north of Beijing, the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum of Nanjing was inscribed by UNESCO as part of the World Heritage Sites \"Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The mystery of the third tortoise ==\n\nIn 1999, another, unfinished, stone tortoise and an unfinished  stele lying on the ground were discovered in a ravine just over 100 m to the southeast from the Sifangcheng Pavilion, and even closer to Madame Chiang Kai-Shek's former villa (known as Meiling Gong). The tortoise,  larger than those under the Shengde stele and the Kangxi Emperor's steles, and the matching blank stele were recognized by experts as being products of the early Ming, but the reasons for their manufacture and abandonment became subjects for speculation among historians. A number of possible explanations - from faulty material to the overthrow of the Jianwen Emperor by the Yongle Emperor in 1402 - have been advanced.\nIn the meantime, the tortoise and the blank stele (\u65e0\u5b57\u7891)  have been moved to the Red Chamber Culture Park (\u7ea2\u697c\u827a\u6587\u82d1, Honglou Yiwen Yuan), located just east of the Ming Xiaoling complex. The park (which otherwise is a modern Dream-of-the-Red-Chamber-themed landscape and sculpture park) can be visited on the same ticket with the Ming Xiaoling proper.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nXiaoling Tomb, Nanjing, China (Asian Historical Architecture - a Photographic Survey) - includes detailed site map and photos.

          "I was happy that we hired a private tour guide for the visit of the tombs. If you are not interested in history, without a tour guide, you'll just consider it as pieces of bricks. However, if you listened to tour guide's explanation, you'll realize the fabulous of old wisdom.",

          "I had seen pictures of this place, but I wanted the experience of actually visiting it. The place was meant to inspire awe and it does! The pathway up to the tomb is lined with giant stone animals, and there are several gates that take you up to the tomb itself. The most",
          "This tomb is part of the park complex which also includes the Sun Yat Sen Memorial. I would recommend taking a ride up using one of the available buggies for about 10RMB which saves you the walking time. The place is historic and shows the story during the Ming dynasty that",
          "We walked here from the Mausoleoum through the park which was lovely and tranquil. The tomb has been well preserved and is a good opportunity to see a real piece of history.",
          "Many interesting parts to explore as you approach the main tomb building. The size of the wall as you approach it is immense and then you enter the dark tunnel leading you up towards the main tomb. The inside is not as exciting but does have lots of information about the",

          "This tomb was built for the emperor Hun, the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife. The tomb was badly damaged during the Taiping rebellion in March 1853. However, the surviving fragments, allow us to speak about the greatness of this building.",
          "The area is closed to purple mountains and there can be a lot of people on weekend but on sunny day it is a good place to visit or have a walk around especially at this time of the year (February - March) where the cherry flowers are blossomed. There are good little street in",
          "Tip: get a tourist car to take you here if you are going from the Sun Yatsen Mausoleum. Saves time and effort and you'll need it for the walk! We spent almost half a day there, walking from one place to another. I highly recommend to go and take a walk around purple lake, you'll",
          "This was a nice park which shows the history of amazing China with his dynasties. Nanjing has had 10 dynasties at least that is what they told me.",
          "Former Chinese emperors love to make a big deal of their tombs, including huge gardens and majestic structures in the design. So visiting this site is more about viewing these gardens and structures. The actual grave is actually right at the end of these structures in a forested",
          "Quite an interesting place to visit. There isn't actually that much to see at the tomb itself, but the site of the main building in beautiful forest scenery is very nice. The tomb building itself is impressive, too.",
          "A good place to spend a whole day. Be prepared for lots of walking. To get up there you need to board bus #2 which cost RMB2. But is jammed pack and getting back is also another headache. We ended walking down the hill as the wait for the bus is almost eternal. Very",
          "A huge complex in the nice park, not far from Mausoleum. There are several ways, one with the beasts, the other with generals, still other with mandarins; you better go through all of them on the way to the tomb, as it is very beautiful.",
          "Entered via gate 5 after visiting Meiling Palace. There was a tomb museum near to the gate and the ticket entrance (which was quite hard to find) was just behind it. In sum, you would have to walk further in front and then turn right to make a U turn . the route towards the tomb",
          "This park which contains the Ming Tomb as well as the Sacred Pathway is stunning. The gardens are maintained to a higher level than any other I've seen in China and are magnificent, with many different garden areas and pavilions to discover. If you walk off the main tracks",
          "I went to this tomb with a colleague on his first visit to China. Even though it was my third visit, I still find the sight of the final wall and building to be breath-taking. Sadly it was pouring when we visited which detracted slightly from our enjoyment. However, it was a",
          "This is simply a beautiful area to visit. The walk up the mountain is lovely, and not too bad. The steps seem never-ending, but the view from the top toward Nanjing is worth it. So many things to see- I can't remember how many there were. Walking back down from the top is so",
          "Xiaoling Tomb Mausoleum is a historical site. The garden that surrounds the Xiaoling Tomb is large, calm and provides some informations about Ming dynasty (statues, informative stones...). The museum is very rich of relics. There are some restaurants near to the museum and a",
          "A beautiful place ful of cultural treasures, the stone animal walk and teh tombs are beautiful. A must go destination if you are in Nanjing. Cheap to catch a taxi up there or take the local bus.",

          "The Xioling Tomb is another of the must-see parts of Purple Mountain, despite of the 70 yuens. Even though a lot of the original tomb is missing, the remaining buildings are spectacular. I was particularly impressed by the platform on which stands the building where the shop is",
          "I went for 3 hours and didn't cover half of it. Definitely worth a visit even if you only have an hour. Interesting historical memorials that give a glimpse of the emperors that ruled in ancient times. All within a beautiful setting with lovely plants, lawns, etc. Very peaceful",
          "We got off at the Muxuyuan station and ended up at the entrance gate to the tomb. The entrance fee was 70 RMB, a discount was offered for senior over 60. It was about a 25 min walk from there to reach the site. The walk was through a park like walk way, very enjoyable and",
          "The walk up to the tomb was beautiful however unless you understand what you're seeing along the way it loses a lot of significance. It would be much better with a robust audio guide.",
          "This place is by far my favorite place to visit in Nanjing. I love sharing it with every person that I come here with. I marvel at the beauty of the stone carvings everywhere. Walkways; stone dragons around the main building; the bixi and steles; the stone figures along Spirit",
          "Firstly, this place is huge! You could easily visit many times and still manage to find something new to explore. There is a lot of history here and it's also a fantastic escape from the city.",

          "Obviously important place in ancient Chinese history, there is unfortunately not too much to see. Not a priority if you don't have time but can stop there in case you go to Sun Yat Sen's mausoleum.",
          "Really enjoyed wandering around the gardens on a drizzly day. It was quiet and peaceful so nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of Chinese cities. Would be amazing in spring with plum blossoms everywhere. The tomb itself is really just a big brick building but it is of",
          "walk around in an huge area with some tombs and buildings from a long time ago, lazy weekend and really a visit worth",
          "We really enjoyed this part of the Purple Mountain. The walk towards there is framed by statues and shaded by trees, making it very pleasant. The complex has nice architecture and is an interesting spot for history geeks. Unfortunately, as with majority of Nanjing sightseeing,",
          "If you're already at Purple Mountain for other reasons, then you should stop by and see it but it shouldn't take top priority. There isn't much that is unique or particularly grand about this tomb. The crowds all gravitate elsewhere, so it is relatively quiet and there are",
          "All in one area: Zhongshan Mountain National Park in Nanjing. All main attraction are here. Xiaoling Tomb was the first one, that's why its good to be here.",
          "This review concerns only the tomb itself without the surrounding garden. There is nothing to see or to say about the tomb. We walked up the stairs and expected to see something, but nothing. This tomb is far more boring than Zhongshan Ling, and it is not free. What's more, the",
          "Okay, so it seemed as if half of Nanjing heads to the Purple mountain to relax on a sunny bank holiday weekend. Add in all of the selfie sticks, umbrellas and tourists stopping in the middle of the path to take yet another selfie - then this is not a relaxing walk in the park!",
          "If you make a trip to the Purple Mountain, you should visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and the Ming Tombs which will easily take you half a day to a day, so an advice is to start early to avoid the crowd. Very nice and big park with a long stroll to arrive at the 600 year-old",
          "The Ming Tomb is one of my favorite sites in Nanjing. It is one of the many Purple Mountain attractions. It is accessible from Xiamafang metro, but does require a brisk walk. There are many entrances, but I recommend starting at the Square City entrance, and following the",
          "A lot of enjoyable parks to walk through. The long walk to the tomb is nice but ends with a lot of steps. There is a garden and another long walk down an alternate way to the tomb entrance (no access, though) where you see pairs of statues (first half former advisors, second",
          "Thia tomb along with the Sun Yatsen mausoleum are part of the same park and definitely are amongst Nanjing's top attractions. It's hard to navigate through this mammoth park complex and I recommend buying the ticket that allows you to access transport inside the park to save",
          "If you get here make sure to wear your walking shoes because it takes a few hours to get around. Nevertheless I went last weekend just as the plum blossom was blooming. So of course there were lots of people visiting. As it was plum blossom festival the tickets were reduced",
          "We had a free weekend day on a business trip to Nanjing, so we saw many of the sights. The Xiaoling Tomb is impressive.",
          "The tomb is beautifully restored, colourful and great to see. Other areas are immaculate and signs in both English and Chinese as well. Worth seeing, i think entry was 70rmb for the entire area",
          "The Tomb was by far the most interesting part about visiting Nanjing. Be prepared to spend at least a full day. Two days at a nice leisure pace. It is nestled in the heart of a very vast park filled with statues, waterways, buildings and culture. The Tomb features a massive",
          "This place is very big and lots of walks ,the tomb is not open yet ,but they have quite good museum very informative .very interesting site and keep wondering all these empire speed so much time and money to look after they after life ,lovely animals status and beautiful",
          "this place is very beautiful when it's autumn, colours are fantastic! it's a typical tomb of a rich family, you can see the stone animal procession that leads to the tomb",
          "The two walking paths are the best attraction there. The 70 Yuan entrance fee is too high considering the tomb itself is not excavated. Not much to see. The statues on Shen Dao (holy road?) and Shi Xiang Lu (stone elephant road) are amazing. They shouldn't have put any plants",
          "I walked here from the Hanyuan Hotel, which is about 30-40 minutes away. The entrance fee was 70 yuan. There are several entrances. I entered from the one nearest the first gate which is a very tall impressive building. The final part of the tomb appears as a high imposing",
          "Gorgeous area and fascinating history. Full of tourists, but that's China - you can't expect differently. Don't go on a tight schedule, as this whole place is huge and there are many things to see. Reserve a full day, I'd say. If you feel tired or want to save some time, there",
          "This well preserved tomb along with the gorgeous 600 metres \"spirit path\" is located in a beatiful park, much better worth visiting than Xiaoling successors in the famous 13 Ming Tombs Valley near Beijing. Take your student card along and get a reduced entrance fee ;-)",
          "Visited at the recommendation of our hosts. The tombs are located within a very large urban park. Well worth visiting but you must have good walking shows. Access to vehicle is limited in the park and you must walk a great deal to get to it. I enjoyed the walk through the",
          "The architecture must be excellent considering the period. The engineering must be prefect to build such a site. I was told repair and modernisation was done to the site and I still feel the whole site is impressive. I am a handicap person who cannot walk long distance and I",
          "Excellent walk up through the gates, shrines and woods to the tomb. Do not miss the processional walk through the paired stone animals and figures.",
          "Even if the building of the tomb is the main goal of this attraction, I find the surrounding park more interesting.",
          "The park where the tombs are on is good but the tombs aren't impressive compared to other tombs one can see in China and globally. I would've considered giving it an extra star but the museum by the tombs was entirely in Mandarin so I it wasn't really \"user friendly\" for me but",
          "The tomb of the first ming emperor is an amazing monument and a must-see in Nanjing. However, it tends to be crowded and at the end a typical tourist-trash-store is welcoming you.",
          "A significant tomb located in a lovely wooded area on Purple Mountain. The walkway of stone animals is particularly great - and good fun even for 3 year olds.",
          "Having seen the Ming Tombs in Beijing we wanted to see the first of the lot, here in the first capital of the Ming Dynasty. As expected, the architecture and layout was the same. Overall the experience was similar to Chang Tomb in Beijing, but with slightly less to see. One",
          "On both sides of the main path there stand ceremonial stone sculptures. Of warriors, horses, elephants, and numerous legendary beasts. They stand in pairs, facing each other. It's an interesting background for photos or selfies.",
          "First of all this is different from the Ming Tombs outside of Beijing. This is the tomb of the first Emperor in the Ming Dynasty. Very interesting and large complex. You could probably spend half an hour exploring everything and the museum outside of the complex if you wanted",
          "The tomb was great but the gardens are better. The walkways with the ancient statutes are amazing. There are several museums to visit.",
          "We specifically wanted to see the first Ming tomb(s) to compare with those outside of Beijing and to see how they differed from the tomb of Wu Zetian. The Spirit Way leading to the tomb of the 1st Ming Emperor was long and impressive with matched pairs of tigers, elephants,",
          "Visited in Nov 2012, the area of the Tomb is huge like that of 13 Tombs in Beijing! All we see are palaces and trees, I can't remember all of the tiny details of the Tomb but it's worth a visit. You can see the sarcophagus of the emperor there...",
          "Nearest Metro is Muxuyuan and entrance is from gate 3. Cost 70 RMB for the Ming Tombs and realized it also covers the whole park with its different attractions as well. The other attractions are Plum Blossom Gardens , Purple Lake , Memorial to Sun Quan , Sakura Gardens ,",
          "First time you go, you'll see a temple next to it, and then a long strip of park and maybe food fairs, it's mostly a place for families to relax and use open spaces, not very touristy really.",
          "There is very little to see and would recommend skipping this unless you're a real Chinese history buff",
          "Treat this as a huge park for young and the old! A lot of walking and exploring along the many \"paths to the tomb\", and to get to the tomb is some experience.",
          "A nice walk to this tomb but also nice to be breathing in some fresh air and this tomb was interesting not like any that I have seen.",
          "The Ming tomb was great as it allowed us to go into the top of the building. Although, we could go up the hill where the emperor was buried but there is no sign of exactly where.",
          "The Ming tomb area is quite impressive. This is also part of the Purple Mountain Park, which includes the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sun and Linggu Temple. The Ming tomb complex is quite long, but worth the journey. You walk along paths lined with 400 year old statues of animals",
          "Like most spots in Nanjing, this place lacks the gaudy appeal that sites such as those in Beijing may hold, but it is a nice spot none-the-less. You do have to pay, I can't remember how much exactly though, something like 80 RMB. it would be better if it were free, cause there",
          "I went there in late Autumn, it's very beautiful at that time, trees were in red and golden yellow colors. Many visitors came here to take photos, so be sure to come in the early morning to avoid the tour groups. The area is very big, I spent about 4 hours there, the most",
          "We were here by Sept 2014. A very beautiful place especially if you come by fall season when maple leaf all become red. When the time we came there was only yellow color maple. The tomb itself is nothing much to see because the excavation of basement palace is prohibited by",
          "Walked to the Ming Tomb from the Sun Yat Sen Mausoleum, down the 650m curved path, among pairs of sculptures of various animals both real and fictitious, manicured trees and shrubs, and everything clean and tidy. Although the tomb is closed, the outer buildings and approaches",
          "I was lucky enough to be escorted by local university to the Xiaoling tomb so i cannot say whether it is expensive or not but it worths the visit. One could expect something similar to the forbidden palace. It is less sumptous indeed and less buildings around although the main",
          "Took a cab there. Subway is too far out to walk in. Tix is rmb70 just for Xiaoling, a combo tix rmb100 for Xiaoling, Meiling museum and Linggu Temple. The ticketing is just in front of the tomb buildings, cutting short the traditional approach via the spirit way. This is",
          "Don't imagine the tomb as just a tomb, its a whole complex of palace (ok probably a bit exaggerating :)) but, its a pretty big, while i like history, the place not that impressed to me, probably too many restoration already, and the originality a bit disappear. I don't really",
          "This place is huge and beautiful. There are actually many areas which you can sightsee at. Come with good walking shoes and water and be prepared to walk. I took a detour to a beautiful lake and took my time to look through the little nooks and crannies. Easily spend more than 4",
          "Well preserved Chinese Imperial History. A must for all visitors to Nanjing. Worth a whole day. Will need a whole day to see everything. Wear good walking shoes. Good access & transportation facilities.",
          "People normally associate China's imperial history with the capital, Beijing, but for a few decades before the establishment of Beijing as the capital, the Chinese emperors ruled from Nanjing, literally the \"Southern Capital\". The city walls are a fine reminder of this time, but",
          "Out of the city, and a good walk from any of the drop off points. Plenty to see, with adequate facilities and resting places. Suggest you go early to avoid the crowds.",
          "The walk up to the actual tomb must be nearly a kilometre long, lined with lovely trees and fantastic statues, firstly of animals then huge generals and officials from the Ming period. We particularly came to see the stone animals and they exceeded expectations. Visiting early",
          "another one place which you must visit to nanjing in a very nice place full of trees and parks you visit this monument. they have not take care of this a lot, and inside there is a small Market too , which i didnt like....i dont like markets in monuments, means no respect in",
          "Gigantic premises, when you think you are done, there is more to see. The details of the gardens and the buildings are amazing. It is a great place to visit with the family. Lots of walking and steps. Not handicapped accessible.",
          "This tomb is very nice, restorations did not destroy the charm of this old monument. You will progressively discover old building from ancient China in the middle of the jungle. The atmosphere was very nice and not crownded even if the tomb itself is not so interesting.",
          "Located in the Purple Mountain scenic area and itself laid out in a garden setting, this is a less visited site but nevertheless steeped in ancient history. This is the only emperor mausoleum outside of Beijing and one of the largest. It was originally surrounded by a 45",
          "Like so many monuments, it is difficult to see what is original and what has been reconstructed. Nevertheless: the walk to the tomb is very pleasant and once you get there, the where size of the building is quite impressive. Not clear where the actual tomb is (or was), and there",
          "Amazing in Spring when all the blossoms are in season, otherwise it is a rather dismal walk up to the tomb and around the grounds.",
          "This is one of the many historic sites to visit on the mountain. It is a long walk through gardens and statue lined avenues but, if you like walking amongst ancient ruins its worth it.",
          "I like the buildings but these places honor the rich and powerful and one forgets the 1000s of slave laborers that built these places.",
          "The tombs sit in the \"complex\" of purple mountain, which in itself with the many number of temples, buildings and mausoleum are worth a whole day to spend here. The whole area is a green oasis of hills, trees and hiking paths outside of the city and should be visited. The tomb",
          "Second time here, slightly after the peak of the plum flower blossoming period. Very pretty tomb buildings and gardens, with just a few areas not particularly well maintained.",
          "Have lived in Nanjing for 8 years - MING DYNASTY TOMB - on Purple Mountain is my all time favourite place. NOT the actual tomb - that is not very interesting - but the actual walk way up to it - huge statues of animals - absolutely beautiful when the blossoms are in bloom - for",
          "If you try to visit this place in the late afternoon, you will regret it. There are almost no information and signage, so you will not understand at all what there is to see and WHERE it is. You could walk for countless time without seeing a single statue. And moreover the",
          "This place was a mess! Yes the statues were interesting, but the signage was so poor (in English and Chinese) that we couldn't find anything. We walked forever and enjoyed nature, but it was all in vein. We studied the maps, walked back and forth, and wore ourselves out for",
          "Halfway to the Mausoleum, this would be a refreshing place to visit, albeit not for too long, because it's just like a park with some interesting statues. I wouldn't consider it a landmark. But it could serve as the dessert that completes the feast at the Mausoleum.",
          "A sure place to visit. The Burial site is a BIG stone \"Block\", aurrounded by a great garden full of People and BIG animals statues lined along a wonderful walk surrounded with Trees and Flowers. Finest place for final rest. It is located on the mountain dominating the city, that",
          "Went on a Friday morning before 10am which was nice. Less people and more relaxing. Didn't find the buildings very impressive. What is wonderful is the greenery and the animal statues along the walk towards the tomb. Behind the tomb are steps that appear to be a hiking trail",
          "My visit here, along the ancient stone animal-lined path to the tomb, was actually a beautiful relief because we visited the mausoleum of Dr Sun Yat Sen on the mountain first. It just places life vertically as well as horizontally (in the present). Actually, the surrounding",

          "Beautiful colours in Autumn and worth visiting. Less crowded than Zhongshanling which is free. Like every other tourist attraction in China, tickets are not cheap (RMB70 for the entrance). Perhaps this is even more so since it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nice gardens and",
          "Beautiful park. Lots to do and see so set aside a whole day or at least 4 or 5 hours. Thankfully it wasn't too busy when we went there. We took a taxi there but realised when we got there that we could have gone there by MTR although it would have been a walk uphill to get",
          "Great park with a good selection of sites. I recommend this park if you're interested in history, architecture, or just want to take a walk in a well maintained park. Do be aware that if you take a taxi to the site, they do not pick up visitors from the park. We had to walk",
          "This was my first visit to any type of historic tombs in China. It really was worth a visit - certainly awe inspiring and i was shamed into not knowing more of the history of this beautiful and enchanting country. We planned the visit quickly as we had a day off from our",
          "The tomb is a very nice place to stay during the afternoon. It's located on the purple mountain and shows the huge burial place of a chinese emperor of the ming dynasty. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I found the entrance fee of 70 yuan a bit steep for what is was. The toms is more like a temple, and at the top building the doors were closed so there is no way of seeing the actual Tombs, unless I missed something. Take bus nr 20 to get back into town as there are almost no",
          "This is one of the attractions in a HUGE garden. We trailed behind a tour guide and got a free tour of the place. So beautiful. I love this place. Not enough time to do them all. This garden needs a few days to be completed. Seriously, it's worth it. A world cultural heritage",
          "I had a private guide who gave me so much information about this amazing piece of history. It was a beautiful day, and it's gorgeous.",
          "The pharaohs did better but that is it really. The walk up to the tomb building and the setting for the place tells you a lot about the divine ego (id?) of the buried man in there. Let your imagination fly: you'll really find yourself in a very foreign land and with very",
          "The statues on the sacred walk in are wonderful - elephants, lions etc. Really beautiful path with the new leaves on the trees. The temple itself is apparently much restored (well it is 600 years old and the city has seen a lot of conflict in that time) but interesting and",
          "This is definitly a must-visit. I appreciated the yellow-tile tomb , the almost exact copy of the Forbidden City main door but in a genuine natural landscape. Don't miss the alley with stone animals which is unique in China :-)",
          "Its a nice sacred place where the king of Ming dynasty was buried. A long walk and climb up the wall to visit the tomb but you won't see The tomb except the burial place where a few Chinese words were inscribed. I guess one will appreciate it only if one knows chinese history.",
          "The Tomb f Ming is part of Unesco World Heritage and it says a lot, as there is not much to see of the ancient China in nanjing anyway and if you like history and history of architecture - the place are very well worth to visit. Beware of the few points - it is crowdy, no matter",
          "I like the pathway going to the Main Tomb... it shows Chinese culture and beliefs. I enjoyed most walking along the different animal structures. They were impressive!",
          "The spirit path up to the tomb is quite nice and in the early morning mist, you feel like you are in alien land. The actual tomb is on an enormous scale, but the new 'old' buildings are not so good. You can actually see the bases for the columns of what was clearly a grander",
          "Unfortunately this has been restored to look not authentic. Poor paint details make me think of something from Pier 1 in the US. I was at the Forbidden City the weekend before and this is a sad comparison. The walk up to the tomb is refreshing with statues, shrubbery and",

          "On New Year's Day 2012 after heavy snows had fallen, we walked around the lake to Purple Mountain to the Ming tombs... To our delight the mountain was virtually deserted and we were able to see and photograph without any people in the scenes..a very rare event in China!",
          "The Ming tombs set in parkland are well preserved, well explained in signage in several languages and show how skill were the Chinese architects and designers at that time. The richness of the colours has been well restored and these are a must see in Nanjing.",
          "The monument itself is nice, but the best part is the walk to the tomb. The gardens and pathways are beautiful.",
          "This whole park was really beautiful. I would try to visit in spring or fall. I went in the winter and most of the overhanging trees had lost all their leaves so it was not as pretty as some pictures I have seen but still pretty. The stone creatures along your way just make the",
          "We walked here after visiting the Sun Yat Sen mausoleum. The buildings are recreations of what may have once been erected on the site. They are not the original buildings as in other places in China",
          "This is an extremely relaxing and scenic location. Fundementally a park with arboretum like qualities. Was able to visit in the spring when the ?plum? trees were blooming. While many trees bloomed white or pink, occasionally you would see one or two that had mixed blooming on",

One of the oldest temples in Nanjing,  it is located in the Xuanwu District near Xuanwu Lake.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe temple, which literally means \"rooster crowing\" was first constructed in 527 during the Liang dynasty and has been destroyed and reconstructed many times. The existing temple was initially constructed during the Ming dynasty during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor in 1387. It was destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion but was rebuilt later.\nBy 1931 most temple buildings had been appropriated as barracks by police and army of the Nationalist government of Republican China. The main hall had been emptied completely apart from the large Buddha statue. Only one hall, near the city wall was still being used for worship. The temple remained popular primarily because of its tea house which was also situated in that hall.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWithin the temple are Guanyin Hall (\u89c2\u97f3\u6bbf), Huomeng Building (\u8c41\u8499\u697c), and the Medicine Buddha Pagoda (Chinese: \u836f\u5e08\u4f5b\u5854). The Rouge Well (\u80ed\u8102\u4e95), got its name from a legend that the emperor of the Southern Tang Dynasty and his concubine hid themselves in the well to escape enemy pursuit. The stains of rouge were left on the well: hence the name of Rouge Well.The seven-story pagoda overlooks Xuanwu Lake. There is an entrance to the Nanjing City Wall from the rear of the temple. Behind the temple there remains a section of palace wall called Taicheng.It is the busiest temple in Nanjing, particularly during the Lunar New Year.The newly opened Line 3 metro line has a stop for the temple called Jimingsi\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\u5bfa\u9662\u4ecb\u7ecd (Jiming Temple) (Chinese and English)\n Geographic data related to Jiming Temple at OpenStreetMap",

          "The bridge introduced in our textbook has been a tale for many Chinese like me. it's a master-piece at that time. We come worship this place to worship a dream with satisfaction and disppointment",

          "It was kind of exciting for me to finally see the bridge for myself. I was told that it was a great piece of Chinese engineering because of the interesting story behind it! It was built by workers and people that donated their effort and time in the building of the bridge",
          "Obviously the Chinese are very proud of this massive Bridge, and rightly so, it is impressive, but it is just a bridge. I struggled to see how it could be classed as a Tourist Attraction. I think it's more a large piece of propaganda used to emphasize how mighty and great China",
          "I went in the fall and it was very beautiful. There is an interesting market on the road leading to the park. The bridge itself is underwhelming but it's a nice sight. The bridge is also extremely dangerous due to moped traffic. All in all it makes a lovely place to visit on an",
          "If you know a bit of the history of this bridge, you can understand why the Chinese are so proud of this bridge. This is the first steel bridge built by the Chinese without any help from anyone (especially the Soviets) and has the best safety record. It is a double decker",
          "If you can tolerate the onslaught of honking bike horns as riders whip past you just inches away, coupled with a mouthful of car fumes from the constant flow of traffic; this bridge never fails to impress. Crossing the length of the bridge on foot both at nightfall and by day",
          "The bridge is a landmark for the bravery and sacrifice of the Chinese. Too bad it's packaged as a tourist trap. There are 2 parts to this site, the museum and the shop selling crystal ball painting. The museum is unkempt and dilapidated, the store is beautiful and well",
          "I enjoyed the bus ride across each morning and the hustling walk each night. I felt as if I was reliving the moments of the Vietnam war when we sent young men into boats without lights, food or elbow room. I could feel the insanity of Vietnam.",
          "The bridge was a great landmark as it had a beautiful view which made it look like a flood of boats. The view from the top was even better. 15yuan to go up to the top.",
          "A little history goes a long way. I understand that the \"mixed reviews\" are generated by folks who have little to know view of China. The bridge was completed and open for traffic in 1968. It was the third bridge over the Yangtze after the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the",
          "This bridge, built in the 1960's, was the first bridge across the Yangtze. There are now probably 20 or so, and this makes it interesting to reflect on how quickly China has developed. The bridge also features Cultural Revolution era sculptures on its approaches and quirky",
          "Not much more to say really, it is just a bridge after all. Easy to find and get a taxi driver to take you over it is best, or view from the many river boats that go up and down",

          "The first modern steel bridge built by the Chinese when the Soviets withdraw their support in the late 50's. It's the longest bridge across the Yangtze river where trains can travel through at the lower level of the bridge. It's massive and the structure is sound and gracious.",
          "It showcased history that Chinese could build such an impressive bridge when nobody else could do back then.",
          "The view is exquisite especially under the lights at night . If your kids wanna try a ride with the mini boats do not hesitate. It is safe and it is fun!",
          "Although a trip to the bridge may appear disappointing, the real surprise is the Zhang Guangqiging School of Inner Drawing Art where you can see some of the Master's work and even his students at work. Wander through the shop in awe at this fantastic skill where paint is applied",
          "It is lit up at night and looks like a dream. There are several places to dine on the water-side. Also, there is a boat ride on the river. All works together to make the area a fantastic visit. Oh yes, near the site are a number of small shops. The shopping is good - but the",
          "The bridge, the first double decker road/rail built by the Chinese, is a feat of engineering and worth a visit. The view from the viewing tower at the city end is magnificent, especially to see the constant river traffic on this wide stretch of the Yangzi. We went in the winter",
          "The bridge was suppose to be a joint Soviet-Chinese project but the Soviets pulled out and the Chinese finished by themselves. It's usually on various tour groups places to stop. There are other places to see the Yangtze River rather than from the bridge. However, if you want",
          "The Yangtze Bridge was first double-decker (ie cars and trains) , built by the Chinese in China. You can access the belvedere for a great view of the bridge and of course the Yangtze itself. At night the bridge is illuminated by some 1000+ floodlights, 500+ halogen lights and",
          "I walked across both ways. Unfortunately I made the mistake of walking against the prevailing traffic on motor bikes and scooters, bikes and a small number of pedestrians. Yes that traffic, in true Chinese fashion, uses the bridge paths not the road to cross. Despite",
          "A bridge is a bridge is a bridge. So what? But this bridge is built by the peoples' effort without help from outside. That is what the tour guide told us. Well, it is a very well built bridge. However, the traffic is building up year after year. However, the view of the bridge",
          "This bridge was build with a very interesting story. The bridge itself was constructed between 1960 and 1968. This bridge is the longest bridge with the dual functions of highway and railway. And it's amazing bridge indeed. You must go to the top of this building and see the",
          "It's cool to walk through the bridge from one side to the other in the spring breeze! The bridge has a few arches as its supporting structure for the steel-frame railway level and the concrete roadway level above.",
          "The story of how the bridge was built and the costs of human lives, how the new generation has forgotten, etc, was related frankly by the tour guide. You will get an unobstructed all round view from the tower and the room with the model of the bridge was supposed to be where the",

          "This bridge has a very interesting history and is an amazing piece of engineering. The view from the top over the harbour and city is great (on a clear day) but the best part is listening to the history of the construction and the part that the USSR tried to, but did not, have",
          "Of great importance to the Chinese people as it cut traveling times significantly. Nice viewpoint to see traffic and the river but very smoggy. Not a great tourist site for international travelers.",
          "We were taken to Nanjing Bridge as part of our tour, it was very impressive, because it was a structure that was started in partnership with Russia. I don't know what happened but Russia pulled out of the project, just after it started and China completed it, our guide was very",

          "Get a taxi there. Top of the tower provides very good views across the river. Bustling and busy on the top. Wouldnt recommend small children to walk across. I enjoyed it after learning about the Yangtze in Geography A level. Awful gardens surrounding, no water in fountains. Not",
          "We didn't go out on the towers but just drove across and made a u-turn and came back. Maybe going out on the towers is cooler, but we liked the revolutionary statues. China's good for having revolutionary statues in any place.",
          "We paid to enter the park (7RMB) and go up by elevator to the top of the bridge (8RMB). Even this small amount of money was a waste, don't bother. There are no places nearby where you can get a nice picture of the entire bridge (you are too low and there are trees). The",
          "Nanjing Bridge is a symbol that you can visit. Built in 1968 during Chinese Cultural Revolution, it has been depicted as the symbol of Chinese Communism Power. The first Bridge entirely conceived and built by Chinese engineers, though not the first one on the YangTse, it still",

          "Yangtze is the World's third longest river and a good idea is to walk to the ferry and take it across. You will see Nanjing's skyline and a lot of exciting river traffic.",
          "if you consider going pick a clear day (or evening) and choose the left side of the bridge, 'cos it has a viewing platform. well, the first problem was to get there. Taxis didn't want to take us on the bridge, so finally we found one that took us near it. From there it was",
          "I think I was expecting something a bit more special. OK - it's a bridge that made a big difference in connecting the north and south but worth visiting - I wasn't that impressed",
          "The Yangtze River Bridge was built during the time of Mao Tse Tung and is a spectacular feat of communist engineering, which spans the wide Yangtse River. 1950s engineering is combined with typical 'revolutionary' touches such as elaborate lamp holders and giant propagandist",

          "Very romantic and beautiful walk, but a little crowded if you do it early evening",

        "wiki": "Linggu Temple (simplified Chinese: \u7075\u8c37\u5bfa; traditional Chinese: \u9748\u8c37\u5bfa; pinyin: L\u00edngg\u01d4 S\u00ec; lit.: 'Spirit Valley Temple') is a famous Buddhist temple in Nanjing. It is now surrounded by a large park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe temple was first built in 515 during the Liang dynasty (502-557). It used to lie at the northeast foot of the Purple Mountain, i.e. where the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum is located, since the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) chose the place to be his mausoleum and then the temple was moved to the present place. The temple was named by the Hongwu Emperor himself. It used to be large and covered an area of over 300,000 square metres. Later it was destroyed in warfare during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) and rebuilt during the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor. In the temple, except for buddhas and bodhisattvas, Xuanzang and his relics were enshrined and worshipped.\n\n\n=== Wuliang Hall ===\n\nWuliang Hall, or Beamless Hall, was constructed in 1381, and is 22 metres high and 53.8 metres wide. The hall enjoys high reputation for its special architectural techniques. It has three archways on the front and rear sides respectively. The structure was built with bricks from the bottom to the top entirely, without a piece of wood or a single nail. Thus it was called Wuliang Hall, since Wuliang means beamless. It happens that the hall originally enshrined Amit\u0101bha (the Buddha of Infinite Light) whose Chinese name is similar to \"Wuliang\". Later in 1928, the hall was turned into a memorial hall for soldiers who lost their lives in the Northern Expedition (1926\u20131928). More than 30,000 soldiers were enshrined.\n\n\n=== Linggu Pagoda ===\nLinggu Pagoda is not connected with the temple, but  was designed by American architect Henry K Murphy and built between 1930 and 1932 as a sign of remembrance for the soldiers. The nine-story-tall pagoda stands 60.5 metres high. Speeches made by Sun Yat-sen and epigraphs of Chiang Kai-shek were inscribed on the tower.\nIn the temple, there is also a Three Superb Tablet, on which a painting of Baozhi painted by Wu Daozi, a famous painter; a memorial poem written by Li Bai, a Tang dynasty poet; calligraphy written by Yan Zhenqing, a well-known Tang dynasty calligrapher, is inscribed. Since the three were all masters in their own field in the Tang dynasty, the tablet was considered Three Superb Tablet. Unfortunately, the original tablet was broken in warfare, the present one is a duplicate made during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Geographic data related to Linggu Temple at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August.

        "wiki": "Xuanwu Lake (Chinese: \u7384\u6b66\u6e56; pinyin: Xu\u00e1nw\u01d4 h\u00fa) is located in Xuanwu District in the central-northeast part of Nanjing, Jiangsu. It is near the Nanjing Railway Station and Ji Ming Temple. Five islands within the lake are interconnected by arched bridges. Within the park are temples, pagodas, pavilions, gardens, teahouses, restaurants, entertainment venues, a small zoo, and other attractions. Its main entrance is the Xuanwu Gate.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lake was formed, according to geologists, when tectonic plates shifted and created Mount Yanshan. A legend is that Emperor Sun Quan (182\u2013252) settled in the Nanjing area and he had the lake created and filled with water. The lake was named for a black dragon, believed to be a water god by Chinese Taoists, from a Southern dynasty (420-859) legend. The dragon, seen in the lake, looked like a tortoise and a snake and was named Xuanwu, meaning black tortoise.During the Six Dynasties period (222\u2013859) a garden on a basaltic site was created, which is now considered one of the most scenic places in the park. The area was used for hunting and training by the emperor's family members.Also called \"Military Rehearsal Lake\", the lake was used for naval battle exercises during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). The \"Yellow Book Storage\", or the \"Yellow Register Archives\", was built there in the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), and it was thus made an imperial garden and \"forbidden land\".The lake and surrounding area was made into a park in 1911 after the end of the Qing dynasty. It was renamed from Yuanwu Lake Park to \"Continental Park\" in 1928 and officially made Xuanwu Lake Park in 1935. A plan was made for the 2005 creation of the Li Yu Cultural Park, Garden Park, Qingyinge pavilion and an immortality garden.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe main entrance to the Xuanwu Lake Park is through Xuanwu Gate, which is part of the Nanjing City Wall that borders the south and east portions of the park and Ji Ming Temple is in its southwestern area. The Zifeng Tower overlooks the lake. The 444 hectare lake is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) in circumference.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Park ==\nXuanwu Lake Park (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56\u516c\u56ed), once an imperial lake garden, is now a city park. In the spring, the pink cherry blossom trees are in bloom. Summer visitors experience emerald lotus leaves, flowers, and \"a peaceful haven of weeping willows\" followed by red maples and golden ginkgos in the fall. Arch bridges connect five islands. The \"Autumn Chrysanthemum of Liang Islet\" has the Lake God Temple, Wenji Pavilion, the Peony Garden, Bonsai Museum, and a fish pond. The \"Flowers Sea of Ying Islet\" is sanctuary to more than 200 rare species of birds. An entertainment venue, including a bandstand, is located on \"Green Islet.\" The \"Willows and Smokes of Huanzhou Islet\" has a playground for children. The fifth island is the \"Clouds and Mists of Ling Islet\".Within the scenic park are pagodas, pavilions, tea houses, and restaurants. Entertainment options include boating, zoo, and an outdoor theatre. Key attractions include the Nuo\u2019na tower, Lama Temple, cenotaph of Guo Pu, and the Rose Garden. On the lake are boats and ferries. It is also considered the \"Pearl of the Stone City\". If desired, a visitor could stroll through the park for up to five hours.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nIt is designated a National Grade AAAA Attraction. The City of Nanjing has identified it as one of the top five parks in the city. Others are Mochou Lake Park, Qingliangshan Park, Wuchaomen Park and China Gate Castle Park.Nanjing's Couple Park, or Qingl\u00fcyuan Xuanwu (\u5357\u4eac\u60c5\u4fa3\u56ed), is adjacent to the western edge of Xuanwu Lake and behind the Nanjing International Exhibition Center.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site (Chinese)\nXuanwu Lake Park map (Chinese)",

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity.

With an area of 70,000 square metres (17 acres), it is one of the largest museums in China.  The museum has over 400,000 items in its permanent collection, making it one of the largest in China.  Especially notable is the museum's enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Nanjing Museum was one of the first museums established in China. The predecessor of the Nanjing Museum was the preparatory department of the National Central Museum, which established in 1933. The museum took over 12.9 hectares (32 acres) in the Half Hill Garden of Zhongshan Gate. Cai Yuanpei, the first preparatory president of the council of the museum, proposed building three major halls, named \"Humanity,\" \"Craft\" and \"Nature\". Because of China's political instability in the 1930s, only the Humanity Hall was built. During the Japanese invasion, part of its collections were transferred to Southwest China, and in the end moved to the National Palace Museum in Taipei when the Kuomintang lost the Chinese Civil War. The historian Fu Sinian and anthropologist and archaeologist Li Ji were once preparatory presidents, and the archaeologist and museologist Zeng Zhaoyu was the first female president and also a founder of Nanjing Museum. In 1999 and 2009, extensions were built to the museum.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nThe main building was designed by Liang Sicheng in the 1930s combining Chinese and Western architectural styles. The front section is structure of traditional style and features a golden tiled roof. In the back is a Western-style flat-roof structure. Added in the 1990s to the west of the main building is an art hall which references Chinese architecture of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n== Exhibition halls ==\nThere are twelve exhibition halls at the museum. A highlight of the collection is a full-size suit of armor made from small jade tiles held together by silver wire.\n\nQin Garden\nEarthen Ware Hall\nTreasure Hall\nFolk Art Hall\nBronze Ware Hall\nMing and Qing Porcelain Hall\nWu Weishan Sculpture Hall\nAncient Paintings Hall\nModern Art Hall\nJiangnan Silk Product Hall\nJade Hall\nLacquer Hall\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lacquer ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNanjing Municipal Museum\nList of museums in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Chinese and English)",

          "We took a day trip to Nanjing from Shanghai and saw parts of the wall in multiple locations. It was great to have personal guides who spoke English and could give us the history. We visited shortly after the Chinese New Year/Lantern Festival and many lanterns were still up on",
          "Went there for a walk after a business diner, it really gives a feeling for how much history is in Nanjing",
          "Great place to go. You get great views from all around the city. If you are into fitness you can walk all around the walls. I did partway. Was enough for me. There are buggies that Will take you around. Chairs & kiosks to stop & rest. It is a fair walk from one entrance to",
          "Nice to see how the wall is integrated into the city. Around the area are some nice pedestrian shopping areas with some craftmanship stores.",
          "We were really hungry after looking around City wall and our kids was tried after long walks so don\u2019t miss out this. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t look nice outside but the foods were amazing!!! DO NOT Miss this",
          "We visited on a public holiday mid season and I estimate that there were up to one million people in and around the city wall precinct that day. We were in throngs of about 20 people wide on all the streets for most of the day. Absolutely enthralling place to visit...AND the",
          "Really cool walk, plenty of local tourists and impressive lake view and a beautiful Pagoda (10yuan) . You can enjoy one half day over there , be ready for a long walk, worth it!",
          "Fantastic look back into history of Nanjing former capital of China. Really super interesting and well worth the visit",
          "I don\u2019t think that all of the wall is 650 years old, and I certainly didn\u2019t cover the whole length of it (just the part along the lake), but this an impressive monument to the city\u2019s imperial past offering great views. Definitely with visiting this piece of Nanjing heritage if",
          "The Nanjing city wall is the biggest in the world, and with 25 or so km remaining you can still see a lot of it. You have to choose where to go and see it. I followed the advice on an internet site, to go to Zhonghuamen metro station by line 1. When you come out (exit 1 or 2 by",
          "Came here in the evening as I read that the area and view from the top is more beautiful at night. I was not disappointed. We came by subway and the walk from the nearest station is about 1.2 km away. The walls are indeed beautifully lit. The entrance fee of 50 RMB per adult is",
          "Visited the wall in the cool of the evening and walked a few km along the top. What an incredible structure from 650 years ago. The wall is lit up beautifully to view from below. Up on the wall, the lighting is adequate but you do need to watch your step as the walking area is",
          "If this is the only place in China to visit an ancient city wall, by all means do so. The city walls all had an almost identical layout including impressive watch towers and gates. This is a beautiful place to walk and view the city.",
          "There is a small fee to walk on the city wall, but it is well worth it. Not only is it a great place just to see much of the old city, but it's also just a beautiful walk....especially if you go in the early evening or early morning.",
          "If you visit Nanjing you will be overwhelmed by the friendliness of the people and the majesty of the local history. There is plenty to see, particularly around the protected heritage areas and the most obvious example of this is the ancient city wall. Built in the time of the",
          "We walked for many kilometers on the top of this ancient wall. It offers sites that need to be experienced. History & culture are alive and well here",

          "I was surprised to see the city wall when I first visited. The wall is a tourist attraction that requires a minimal fee, its a nice walk on the wall, and you will get a great view of the city. It is also decorated with lanterns (some in animal shapes) and lights up at night.",
          "The grimace reflection in the pond is awesome, especially at night! The wall itself is a wall, but with lots of history. Nanjing City has done a great job of making it a nice park and walk along the river just outside the wall.",
          "It was a great walk through the wall with a nice view of the lake. I travel there in May 3 and the weather was nice and sunny so make sure you have hat or umbrella to.",
          "Massive city walls, you pay 30 rmb to enter. Good views over the city. There are also some siege weapons lined up which is a nice touch. You could walk a good hour on the wall, but after half you probably seen it. Good to combine with Jiming temple and Xuanwu lake & park.",
          "Very popular destination which can make it crowded. They have placed large plastic models of Chinese characters all along the top of the wall. The wall is mildly interesting and offers a great view. It is worth going to if you want to tour the old city. Otherwise, I would",
          "If you come to Nanjing, you should try to stand the city wall to review the whole city and imagine the Ming Dynasty.",
          "Yes the reviews are right. Nice walk great scenery and lovely lake. Even though I was here during a holiday and was packed it was a beautiful area and well worth a look",
          "It is nice to see this remnant of another age still standing, although heavily rebuilt I imagine. I walked the section near the Nanjing Museum as I wanted to stay close to the metro. Not as impressive as Xian\u2019s city wall, but good exercise.",
          "With reportedly one of the longest city circular walls in the world, this defensive structure was built to protect the Ming Dynasty in the 1300's. For me the most interesting aspect was that individual bricks in the wall were \"signed\" to indicate where they were made and who",

          "Thought the wall would've been a little more special, with more history narratives, but it's pretty much just a wall. Much wider than the Great Wall, so it looks more formidable and impressive in terms of scale. The carved calligraphy on the bricks are probably the most",
          "I expected to see more about the history of the wall. Perhaps, the special features of the wall, e.g. the calligraphy on the bricks should be given a little more prominence, as this could easily be missed if you are not aware of it. The significance of the wall in Nanjing",
          "A very well presented city wall similar to Xian. Exits and entrances can be problematic if you just wander along the base of the wall. Excellent views of the lake.",
          "Nexus holidays took us through Nanjing and i was surprised to see a fully intact unbroken wall that surrounds the city. It was completed by the Ming dynasty. Apparently the japanese imperial army could not break through for 6 months as the troops behind the wall was well",
          "Erected about 600 years ago by the emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The wall was one of the largest ever built. The whole wall is not there today but much of it remains intact. Nice visit",
          "I was unable to go to the top but the wall is breathtaking and in wonderful condition. I suggest looking into the history prior to your visit.",
          "When you hear about walls in China, everybody thinks of the Great Wall first. However, the City Wall around Nanjing is very impressive in its own rite. It's taller and wider than much of the Great Wall and encircles the large city of Nanjing, which is also an underrated city for",
          "All over China you will see walls, which were used as a means to protect the inhabitants from invaders. Unlike the European castle, the Chinese walls are spread over a larger area and include a bigger piece of land - which means that they tend to be more massive and serpentine.",
          "I am not into history. Sites like this is not my cup of tea. But for those that do want to learn about the history of places, and are history buffs, of course this is an excellent stop. Entrance is free, as it should be so more people can experience and feel history.",
          "As the City Wall is high and the surrounding buildings are low, you can have a great view of Nanjing. Worth visiting as you can also walk to different gates using the City Wall.",
          "Just spent a few minutes walking along part of this wall, but it is amazing. Great views of the city. Really difficult to realise how old the walls are as they are in such good nick.",
          "Nanjing was Capital of China in the past, so we can see the Wall in the midle of the nowadays city just like we can see in Xian. Nice place to visit and get to know more about Chinese History.",
          "Not sure how this wall compares to other walls accross China, but as a gate to the city it was very impressive. The engineering was awesome.",
          "This magnificent City Wall of China is not to be missed. Although, this might not be as old as the one in Xian, this one is better built and the material represented the artisan of its historical period. You will see a great view of the city especially during the evening as the",
          "Nanjing is one of China's ancient capitals and a hidden gem from international tourists. This is one of the oldest city walls in the world that is still standing and you can walk across for kilometers. Additionally on certain stretches it gives a fantastic vantage of the city",
          "It is an old city wall that you can walk over. Really impressive if you consider that it was built by hand. There is information available in English to illustrate the history of the place. Being there I could not help thinking of a certain South park episode.....",
          "I enjoy the history here. Walking where in World War 2 and even further back in time soldiers stood, fought and died. This wall is one such great example of all the above. It's, for the most part, well maintained. I mean it's basically a huge chunk of solid rock. It's going to",
          "A wall of protection. That is how the city dwellers of Nanjing protected themselves. A tall, broad and a well maintained wall with a beautiful sight of the city and over-view of the surrounding. Impressive.",
          "Nice place for visit, photo shooting and picnic. Visited on a sunny day and i suppose summer its best. A walk on the wall is recommended. You have to pay to walk on the Nanjing wall.",
          "Like some other cities in China , Nanjing also has a city wall, this is called the history back. Maintain Well. Recommended to visit there in the evening.",
          "The wall is beautifully preserved and the bricks with the individual stamping of the makers had me fascinated. Loved the canons and enjoyed watching many brides have their photos taken. Beautiful views over the park and lake also.",
          "Not as impressive as the city wall in Xi'An but a very nice walk along the lake side especially on a nice day",
          "Well preserved wall with massive park and grounds to explore. We were able to explore different facets of the park and observe the daily routines of the local Nanjingers. We also visited Buddhist temple which is adjacent to wall , very intriguing.",
          "Even though it was rainy and foggy, the views of the city and the lake were impressive from the top of the city wall. It is a good idea to spend some time walking over it and be impressed by the blossomed trees, old temples and dominant skyscrapers.",
          "Nanjing is doing an amazing job with air pollution, and sunset at the Wall is a must-do. We were there on a Sunday night, and it seems like every family in Nanking had the same idea. Note how the brick makers had to place their names on individual bricks to ensure their quality.",
          "Worth the money to go up on the old wall. Provides a good view back over Nanjing one way and over the lake the other.",
          "If I were to redo the walk on the wall around XuanWu Lake, I would have started from ShenCe Gate at ShenCeMen Park (northern end of XuanWu lake, a nearby metro stop would be the Nanjing Railway Station stop on the green line or XinMoFan stop on the blue line) and walk",
          "We walked the section of the wall near Xuanwu lake. It costs $30 RMB per person, but those older than 60 are free. Students are also half price. Once you get up on the wall, it goes for miles and miles and is very well preserved. Many bricks are stamped with writing and it is",
          "Go here along with Jiming temple and Xuanwu lake. They are all right next to each other and it makes for an amazing day in Nanjing! It is a good walking distance from the metro and I dont remember the exact prices but they were very reasonable, especially for students like me",
          "Thanks to the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, the city wall of Nanjing was erected. The wall was to consolidate his sovereignty and keep out invaders. This city wall of Nanjing was among the largest city walls ever constructed in China. This 600 year old city",
          "This was a gate to Nanjing. Make sure you do not get caught in the middle. They might pour hot oil on you. In Chinese men=gate. Good for about 1 hour visit",
          "Walked the length of the wall which was super relaxing in the afternoon. Find the concept of the wall very intriguing.",
          "Leaving the Jiming Temple, we took a 5 minutes\u2019 walk to the Nanjing City Wall. Current Nanjing City Wall is built in Ming Dynasty, some 600 years ago. In order to cope with the winding landscape, unlike most of the Chinese City Walls (e.g., Xi-an), the Nanjing City Wall was",
          "One of the best preserved city walls in Asia I\u2019ve come across. Great views and some interesting artefacts. Unfortunately not wheelchair accessible, but once you\u2019re up on the top it\u2019s suitable for all ages.",
          "Start the wall walk at the Jiming Temple pagoda, if you can make the climb. The scenery is terrific, and you will experience both the inner wall near the pagoda, and the lake wall. At the lake wall, I suggest walking north to the gate by the lake\u2019s park entrance. Only a couple",
          "It is right next to he Jiming Temple. You can visit the temple and climb up to the city wall where you will find beautiful scenery of the city s well as the lake that the walls are surrounding. This lake was the naval training center during the empire period.",
          "Visited in November 2017, great to walk around, with great views of the city and river. Highly recommended if visiting Nanjing",
          "There are ample spots around the city to visit the Nanjing City Walls. As we only wanted a whistle-stop tour of the wall we were advised to go to the part of the wall at Taiping Gate where the entrance fee also includes a visit to a small museum within the wall complex. The",
          "It's easy to get to and the section we went to is right next to the Jiming Temple, in fact I believe you can access the wall from the temple by going over a small bridge. There was a small exhibit inside one of the guard houses explaining the history of the wall and with an",
          "Lovely place to walk and see different parts of the city. We accessed it by the lake and then walked past a number of gates",
          "Not far from the city center, and very convenient to visit. We were here last month, the autumn view was amazing.",
          "The old city wall still exists only in sections, some much larger than others. The biggest section surrounds Xuanwuhu Park and requires a RMB30 fee to enter and climb. The wall is amazing, but there's really not much need to climb it or walk along the top as once you're there",
          "We went on a Saturday and there was literally no one on the wall. It was a beautiful walk with some great views of the whole city. An excellent adventure. Also you can rent bikes if you don't want to walk. They even have a seat for a three year old to hang on to.",
          "There are 2 entrance to the City Wall. If you want to see the whole of Nanjing, this is a great place to see it. Can walk on top of the wall to experience the ancient Nanjing",

          "Not much to see, just a wall. It's kept up in good shape but what can you say about a wall? Lots of food and things around to pass the time and relax but a wall can only be so exciting?",
          "Walking the Nanjing City Wall is wonderful - see the lake & the city on mostly flat surfaces. The climb up to the wall is steep stairs, but the wall itself is an easy walk. Take bottled water. You can walk several miles if you plan ahead. Strongly recommend this.",
          "A great city to walk around and explore. And the wall is amazing and to think that it remains after all of these days and years is great. Great for a walk on a nice morning or afternoon.",
          "Easy sightseeing , about one hour at slow pace. Educational exhibits in English. There is a fun shopping area just outside gate of City Wall, Hunan Lu.",
          "If you like an ancient walls, you should see this one also. But behind the wall is large lake where you sit and rest, or rent some boats to go around the lake. There pedals or electric boats. You will have fantastic view from your boat over significant part of the city.",
          "I went on a week day and had the wall almost all to myself. You can get a really nice view of the lake and the surrounding area, very beautiful and peaceful.",
          "We saw the wall and gates at many places, but got onto the wall at the Timing Temple and walked east a long way. There is a good view of the lake below and the mountains with the tombs and memorials as well. Just thinking about the height and the breadth of the wall in its",

          "Big Cty wall is impressing by its lenght and hight. We walked about 2 km admiring the magnificent view of Nanjing. At the end was a Temple with monastry. Awesome!",
          "All this area in general is wonderful. Is a great place to visit, but you will need to do a little bit of walking to truly enjoy it.",
          "Take a nice stroll along the wall that kept Nanjing safe. You can see the whole city and get some amazing pictures.",
          "Similar to other city walls, but covering a very big area. The South Gate was interesting, but wall itself was just fine. Bike rentals weren't great. Compared to other city walls, like the one in Xi'An, it's nothing special.",
          "boring. all walls are not created equal but they are all quite boring. definitely not a must see attraction while here",
          "The wall is quite impressive for how long it is, size, and historical significance. At the China Gate there are golf cart rentals to ride along the wall. Other places it's nice to just walk along the wall and enjoy your day. Combine with visit to Xuanwu Lake to see both and have",
          "We drove by it several times and it was cool all the time. There were engravings on the wall and it was so cool to see the history of this wonderful city!",
          "Perhaps coming from the US, old things like this are particularly interesting. This wall was interesting but not as big as the city wall in Xian...and needless to say the Great Wall, but still interesting to look at and walk along. The most interesting part was a demonstration",
          "When in Nanjing it is easy for you to combine a visit to the Nanjing City Wall and Xuanwu lake since the lake is next to the wall. The city wall is impressive and dates back to the Ming dynasty. Since Nanjing was the capital of the Ming it makes sense that a wall was built to",
          "Cost 30RMB to climb the stairs to the wall. Those above get in at halh price...hehe, need proof of age. There's nothing special and unlike the Xi'an wall and Beijing wall, this has some sort of English transaltion describing when and how the wall was built.",
          "The wall is great for a walk around the city. It's well kept and there are many different areas you can explore, e.g. walk next to the lake on the northern side or close to zhong hua men in the south. There's something for everyone.",
          "Entered near museum just before December sunset. Light mist and cold, had it all to ourselves. Thousands of bricks have writing and makers mark still plainly visible from the 1360's. While lights on edges of crenellations and gates diffused in mist. 28 years to construct using",
          "One of the few wall still largely intact in many places. We entered near the Zhongshan Gate and from there we had good views over the lake and surrounding area. The only downside now is that there is an entry fee, fewer access points to the wall, and limited entry times.",
          "I think it's a great place to visit, first you can explore the Zhonghua Gate in Old town and the either take a walk along the wall or rent bike / golf car. Be prepared for a long way. And bring your water with you ) Entry fee is 50 yuan. Attraction opens at 10am and closes at",
          "We took the south wall gate entrance and rented a golf cart type vehicle. That was so fun to stop to take pictures and hit the bumps. You get it for one hour so that was more than even time to do the whole wall where they allow the carts.",
          "I spent the morning walking around the lake and then a good few hours exploring the wall, which was great. Even though its not as impressive as the Great Wall or Xian its still pretty cool and a great way to understand the history of Nanjing. Off you go then!",
          "One of the many city walls around the Nanjing city. Take a 2-hour walk along the top of the walls for some good views of the Xuanwu lake.",
          "Nanjing's city walls are certainly impressive. But I preferred the walls at for example Xi'an, as you can cycle at the top of them (whereas in Nanjing, you can just walk along the walls at the bottom). Still, there are quite a lot of footpaths along the bottom of the walls, so",
          "I was taken to this place by the conference organizers. Its a beautiful place and you get one of the best views of the Nanjing city atop of this wall. It is rich in its heritage and gives a deep insight into the defenses of the Ming dynasty. The view especially of the sunset",
          "The wall is great to look at and has a lot of history to it; unfortunately, a lot of the history you will have to find on your own. I do recommend seeing it and looking into the hostory",
          "A formidable structure, left intact at least 700 years. Some 200-years old cannons on the top. Number of gates of different sizes.",
          "i walked the wall from 4pm to sunset. It was wonderful - peaceful without the noise of the city and with few crowds but able to see all the city old and new. only cost 30rmb too - a bargain",

          "I went with a couple of friends onto the Nanjing city wall, the section near Zhonghuamen. There the walkable (or rideable, bike rental at the start) part is about 4km long. Very nice views of the city. While being on the wall notice the inscriptions on the stones, these are",
          "Impressive wall which provides an opportunity to walk along sections an enjoy the contrasting views from each side. Take snacks and drinks to enjoy a few hours",
          "Fun to walk on the wall and see how the town was protected. Views at all points were stunning. Walking the wall was difficult as it is uneven.",
          "You should visit if you have a chance and be astonished by the amount of history within the district. And the temple is next to it, so it's a two in one visit.",
          "This wall is more than 650 years, built (finished) in Ming Dynasty. The wall is still standing around Nanjing and the original bricks are covered with Chinese characters on one side, do you know why? It`s on the list of World Heritage, hope we can make it.",
          "This place is good for picnic, gathering and also for a long walk in the evening along the lake. Lighting kites make sky more beautiful.",
          "Extraordinary nice, with beautiful lake view (starting the walk from Jinming temple). An underrated piece of China. Rather than sharing one square meter with 1000 other people on the most busy pieces of the Great Wall, go here and enjoy a relaxing walk.",
          "Check out the many bricks inscribed with the makers name and details, done as a form of quality control. It is a pity that some of the restorations done are bodges using the wrong materials.",
          "Walking up and up and when you think you are at the destination a few more steps but well worth it The temple at the top is worth going up just for the view",
          "The view from the city wall includes the tallest building in Nanjing & the ancient Buddhist nunnery- old meets new in China again. Fascinating!",
          "There are some sections of the wall that are so quiet and peaceful, without any other tourists around, you'll forget you're in a modern tier 2 city! It reminds me of the city wall in Xi'an, except a lot more peaceful (and less wide).",
          "It is an impressive place, the wall is tall and wide, very well built and and its conditions is just excellent. During day time is good to watch the extension, the weapons reproduction shown in there as well as the details of the construction, the signed bricks and impressive",
          "One of the best attraction in Nanjing. It's a beautiful place to spend the day. The park is free but you have to pay 30 RMB to go to the wall.",
          "There are many different places to get up on the Nanjing Wall. I like the nearest to Laomendong. Here, built into the wall are large rooms where soldiers were barracked. There are also some small historical exhibits which are interesting.",
          "When you think of the invasions of Nanjing over the years the fact that this wall remains standing is truly amazing!",
          "The old city wall offers great views (especially the section by the lake) and a good way of walking between sites such as the lake and the chicken temple. Beware that it offers no shade in Nanjing's very hot summers.",
          "One of the many attractions in China with a great history. You may walk a few kilometers overviewing parts of the city.",
          "The Nanjing city wall was the longest in the world when it was built (16th c). Long sections of it are still in existence. Visit the Zonghua Gate in the south for a great experience of the wall and its defensive role.",
          "Beautiful, peaceful and historic entrance fee require in order to enter overlook breathtaking scenic of Xuan Wu Lake and Jiming Temple",
          "We explored the wall in a couple of places and recommend: 1. Daytime - from the Jiming Temple with views of the XuanWu Lake and Park, Jiming Pagoda and Intercontinental hotel tower 2. Nighttime - from the Zhonghua Gate when the wall is nicely lit-up (come between 6.30-8pm) Each",
          "The Nanjing City Wall has a few entrances but the main one is at Zhonghua Men. Needs to pay an entrance fee. The walk on top of the wall is quite breath taking as it will show you a different view of Nanjing. The walk can take at least 1.5h with some exit points along the way.",
          "This was the first stop I made when I arrived in Nanjing on a bullet train from Shanghai. Not many taxi drivers spoke English in Nanjiang so I feverishly googled City Wall of Nanjing and several places popped up. One of them is on the outskirt of the city in a scenic area.",
          "Very well maintained. As you would expect at a city wall, there are lots of steps, but they are even and of human size not like the Great Wall. Well worth the effort to climb and walk. Entry is reasonable and like most Chinese historic sites there are concessionary prices for",
          "First time we went to the wall (around 2013), there were a couple of entrances you could go up the wall and some were free of charge. This time only one (proper/official) entrance was open and you had to pay the entrance fee. Just after the entrance you can read up about the",
          "Great views of the city and nice to walk around. The Great Wall is not much wider but is more imposing because of its altitude. It is definitely a place where a sunhat is required on a hot day.",
          "It's part of the city and you won't miss it. I suggest you to get onto the city wall via Zhong Hua Men before sunset and take a walk along the wall for 1 hour or so, I think it's the most beautiful scenery in Nanjing. Entrance fee is 50RMB from memory.",
          "It was raining and cold for May in Nanjing, a walk from Zhonghua Gate to Wuding Gate is not enjoyable, but definitely memorable. Looking at the whole city rain, you look at the fragile and saddening history",

          "It's not bad, but it's nothing special. It offers a chance to look at the city and park for a little higher up, and the exercise is good. But unless you know your Chinese history, it's just a walk on a stone wall. For me, the Great Wall of China is more impressive. On hot",
          "City wall buily during the Ming dynasty. It is very impressive with large parts remaining or restored. The main gate is particularly impressive, exhibitions however a bit boring.",
          "Other cities had their walls torn down in the rush to modernize, but for political reasons Nanjing was put last in line to receive modernization. Good thing!",
          "It's a well preserved relic site from thousands years ago. I enter the site from Zhonghua Gate and walk along 3 km to the south. In the right side you can see the beautiful Qinhuai River where locals do their morning strolls, fishing and biking. More to the south you can catch a",
          "I didn't get to walk on the wall as we visited rather late in the day. However we walked around part of the lake admiring the very impressive wall. Don't remember seeing too many other city walls that are as intact as this one. Very pleasant evening stroll along the lake,",
          "I really enjoyed taking a walk on this ancient and giant wall. Also provides you with stunning views of the lake and city.",
          "Ignore whoever said you can't walk on the wall. Yes you can. You pay \u00a530, but you can. Amazing piece of history and views of the lake",

          "Took the metro to Sanshan Street on line 1 and then walked down to the Gate of China. We spent some time here and then walked east for a good hour and a half until the wall ended at the water gate. Good opportunity to see parts of the city on both sides.",
          "You can virtually feel the history of the Ming Wall by touching it and its amazing it stood the test of time despite the turbulence of mankind. The wall has outlived its purpose and now stand as a remembrance to the past that we should learn from. The only disappointment is that",
          "Nanjing's history is one of protection of its people. The various sections of the Ming City Wall are important starting point of the tour.",
          "Worth the climb up the stairs, a fun visit that is definitely worth revisiting with different lights and weather. Excellent for architecture and history buffs. And pretty cheap",
          "I was in Nanjing China for an official visit. We took some time off one afternoon to pay a visit to the Nanjing City Wall and it was a worthwhile experience. I have not been to the Great Wall of China but the visit to the Nanjing City wall was itself an eye opener. To see the",
          "The city wall provides good views but it is also difficult to leave, so make sure you use it as an itinerary item rather than a shortcut as you may get frustrated. Very limited entry and exit points",
          "If you have time have a look at the wall and enjoy the view over the City. If you are lucky you will find bike rentals. We did it although it started to rain but we had a lot fun.",
          "If you are in Nanjing you have to go to the wall. Not as long and impressive as Beijing but very well preserved and rebuilt. You can spend an hour walking at the top or even hire a bike and bike around. There is a very small museum and a small coffeshop. Unfortunately the view",
          "Entrance fee RMB 30. 25km in total. A good place to see Ji Ming temple and xuanwu lake, especially for the sunset. Not so crowded. quiet and peaceful walk!",
          "If you are in Nanjing you definitely want to spend few hours walking on the City Wall. It's a historical and cultural stroll, which I recommend to rent a bike if you want to visit it entirely.",
          "Not much to look at but an interesting history. We drove around the city and had a review about the wall, etc.",
          "The City Wall and the Scenic Place are actually one and the same. Whether you enter from up or down, the entry fee is 30 RMB. The Wall: The wall, designed by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang after he founded the Ming Dynasty. Nanjing, the former capital over 600 years ago, the wall took",
          "We took the subway to this site and walked about 1km. We took the bus back to the subway station. We ate along the way and there wasnt much food to eat there. The entrance fee was 30-50Y. Inside was pretty cool and we ended up staying in side the gate for a while and watched",
          "This was an interesting history experience and had nice views along the way. Some steps, but not really strenuous. It did remind me of the Great Wall but much easier to do. It can be a long walk if you desire.",
          "I walked along the wall in an afternoon and it was very pleasant. Could see the lake and had a great view of the city.",
          "a must see while in town - visit the wall at the Gate of China. it gives you an idea of the great history of Nanjing",
          "The architecture must be excellent considering the period. The engineering must be perfect to build such a wall. I was told repair and modernisation was done to the wall and I still the whole wall site is impressive. Next to the Great Wall of China, this mini version of wall",
          "Very impressive site which we thoroughly enjoyed and spent a surprising large amount of time there. We loved the views from the top of the wall and wished we had walked a bit further on the wall but it was really great to see the sections we saw. If you have been to the Great",
          "There are only a few 'types' of attraction in the world, whether they are museums, sky scrapers or monuments. The Nanjing City Wall is almost a type in itself. It is remarkable how well preserved it is and frankly how what an amazing achievement it is. A wall built brick",
          "One of the highlights of Nanjing. A very well preserved medieval wall with nice views of the city. Do not recommend to walk the whole length on a sunny day.",
          "Once up on the wall we had to walk some way before we could get back down at another gate. I know, I should have known better than to take a small child, but normally she's good at such things, but this particular place did not capture her imagination. It was a hot day and it",
          "Truly amazing that such a large tall and long wall was constructed to surround the city. The work put into this and the effort to maintain and restore it is excellent. Well done to the people of Nanjing",
          "A nice walk with a great view of the lakes and the city. A nice tea house and a museum to visit the wall.",
          "A wall in near original condition. Don't wear your heals to this one ladies the floor is quite uneven. Great views, well worth a vist",
          "This is a well preserved city wall from the Ming Dynasty. It stretches very long and is a great place for a stroll especially in spring or autumn.",
          "It was incredible to walk on something as old as the city wall and look at the new city. The contrast is mind-blowing and I think you have to go.",
          "If you are passing by, you might want to take a peek. But, it is not something you need to go out of your way to see.",
          "Visited in November 2012, as usual city walls like this is very STRONG! A fortress type of wall that protects the city from wild invaders. Very similar to the Great Wall in Badaling or Mutianyu) Nice place to be)",
          "I am very fond of historic wall in every old city. It is really amazing to walk on the top of this hundred years built city wall of this old city. Though it is narrower than the one in Xian, it is still an interesting and momorable experiencef for a complete walking. When you",
          "I think it needs more middle-exit down the wall aheading to lake side.",
          "Its the only wall built around the city in the world, its an amazing sites to be, just like the great wall of china in Beijing. You can walk up and around the wall on a pleasant evening, there are some nice food streets around the place that you may enjoy, If you are in Nanjing",
          "True piece of history. Go in the direction of the Olympic rings and go to the top. It's scenic, there's a small museum, and you can see areas both inside and outside the Xuanwu Lake area.",
          "Made forsafety of this ancient city, but now population and city limits exceeds much more outside wall. Still a landmark attraction for tourist. Well maintained wall.",
          "The Ming City Wall is quite broad and large. It spans several dozen km and goes through many parts of the city you wouldn't get a great view of otherwise. You can walk as much or as little as you want as there are several exits, and the engrish signs all over the place really",
          "The city wall is quite huge. I usually go up at the Xuanwumen side and walk until I get to Jiefangmen. That is usually a nice relaxing stroll that takes about 1 hour. But the whole wall is quite long and there are multiple access sites. From above you get great views of the",
          "No need to risk your life crossing the busy streets, you cruise on a large elevated hiking trail, which is the 650 years old, one of the longest city walls in the world. You learn about the history of Nanjing on the way and discover the sweeping views of the city. Best urban",
          "Yes, you're just walking on a wall...but I LOVED it! There was hardly anyone else up on the wall, the day was beautiful, and it was so peaceful to walk up there and look out over the beautiful Xuanwu park. I was able to go up for only 15 RMB because of the student discount. I",
          "There are lots of places to get up on the wall most of them cost money. But the views are great. Make sure you have good shoes on and some water. There is not water to buy on most of the wall and if your older it will get very hot.",
          "Seems silly when the actual attraction is the wall, which is better seen when you are not actually on it. If you are really interest in walking atop it, then you should visit another site that allows access to the wall - like Yuejiang temple - and kill two birds with one stone.",
          "You see once of this many walls in other parts of China and you see all and unless you are into chinese history of the different dynasty, you may just not look in ewe. ..a good view once you are up ghe walls n try to imagine back then the life of soldiers n etc.mings dynasty has",
          "There are 25km worth of walls that can be walked on. We paid 30 RMB (students were free) and walked from Xuan Wu Gate to the Jiming Temple (Olympic rings). It was worth it. If you could rent a bike and ride along that would be fun too. They have done a nice reconstruction",
          "Its just a wall built by an emperor. A bit far from Zhonghuamen metro station. You won't find taxis easily. Entrance ticket is 50/person. 50%Discount for students. Only the view from the top is good.",
          "The old town wall is very cool. The view is good and very cozy place.",
          "The Nanjing City Wall is a fantastic sight to see and well worth the effort to visit if you find yourself in Nanjing. It is said to be the largest intact city wall in China. And honestly, I preferred it to the much more famous Great Wall outside Beijing. Perhaps because it",
          "Great views, and some good walks along the top. Cant do the whole city but the sections you can do are really impressive and you see all sorts looking over the sides at the old cit",
          "This is a superb example of a garrison fortification. Get down to the South Gate and start from here. There is a huge citadel with defences and battlements all around. The big thing here is that the bricks were made with inscriptions telling who paid or sponsored the brick,",
          "like a younger small healthier version of the great wall but no tourist. lovely views around of city and lake area! easy to get around. some tower have informative history bits too",
          "I love to get a perspective of a city from above if possible and from an ancient wall is even more special. Allow yourself some time to walk some of the many kilometers of wall that surround the city and sit adjacent to the lake and rivers. It is a great way to enjoy some",
          "Nothing special......you can tell by the lack of Chinese tourists who usually are in great numbers at big attractions",
          "Not sure if we come at the right spot, when we came around 5.30pm, the place was very quiet, and only less than 10 people, while the wall is amazing, and give you idea how they defended the city back then, nothing else special there. The wall open until 9pm (forgot what time it",

          "Not as big and long as great wall but a must to see when visiting nanjing. Main wall of the Ming dinasty which still stand to date.",
          "Most of the city of Nanjing was destroyed in the 1930s during the massacre by the Japanese, and most of today's city is just concrete flats and high-rises, so to see something of the original city is welcome.",
          "Easy to access and very well kept, spoilt in places by reproduction figures etc.However, take a close look at the actual bricks of the wall, each one signed by it's maker. Check the history before you go.",
          "Despite the damage caused during the Japanese invasion of Nanjing, much of the walls are intact and very enjoyable to walk where you can.",
          "Awesome City Wall ! Really impressive what people could build without a machines. Well maintained City Wall is very high and pretty wide on some places. You can view a modern city of NanJing with skyscrapers on the one side and the mountain above the lake on the another side of",
          "It's a portion of a wall. What else can you say? It's fairly clean, it's been restored so it's not like you're looking at ancient ruins. Lots of foliage to see as you walk along, quite a few places to sit and rest. And it's free.",
          "The wall is an important cultural relic for the inscriptions on the bricks. The Nanjing citizens attach great importance to the work of protecting the wall and access to climb onto the wall is limited.",
          "Awesome place. Wear comfy shoes and clothes, bring an umbrella for rain and sun, and a poncho. It rained in the middle of the day. You will go up the mountain with a ski lift chair. Coming down, you have an option of ski lift or a wagon!!!!",
          "I went to the Shanghai railway station and found the English window (49). A colleague already printed out the train schedule for the day of all Gtrains to Nanjing so I circled the train I wanted and handed it to the agent. She indicated there were no 2nd class seats on that",
          "Absolutely include this on your itinerary as it provides a fabulous perspective of fortifications - and the need for same - in centuries past. The length and complexity of the wall when it was constructed is quite extraordinary and you can certainly feel the history as you walk",
          "I had other plans for the day but somehow ended walking this wall and was very impressed without knowing at the time any of the history of the wall. You get great views to Xuanwuhu Lake and park below, the Purple Mountain district and the city. I walked this wall and continued",
          "A great story behind this wall with a great view from the top to the outer areas of the city. Back in the day you would have had to crazy to try and penetrate all four gates to get through the city wall! If the archers didn't get you the soldiers running out of the hidden dens",
          "I couldn't help thinking, as we approached Nanjing, of the sorrowful history of the massacre in 1937, I thought the city would still have a pall hanging over it but not at all. It is a thriving, happy bustling place, situated at the foot of a mountain but very flat in itself",
          "This wall is placed between jiming temple and xuanwu lake.. i don't really have a plan to went here but since i have to cross it so it doesn't hurt to take a look.. the wall was really big and long, it reminds me of great wall only this one located in the middle of the city..",
          "The wall is pretty impressive even as Nanjing is modernizing itself. It's a landmark to add to set Nanjing apart from other cities in China.",
          "This one impressive wall. One of only three large city walls left in China. It even manages to outshine the Xian city wall not only in length but also in sheer audacity. It was built around 1370 and is 33 km long. I'm not sure if its complete as I only saw sections of it.",
          "The wall is magnificent and beautiful, a must see if you're in Nanjing. You can actually catch glimpses of it as you are traveling on the road, but standing on top of it is just different. There's no shop or activities here, just walking and admiring the views and materiality of",
          "An interesting relic is what I would categorize this attraction. I did make it a point to travel here to visit, and enjoy the park with my guitar a couple of hours before leaving for Shanghai.",
          "Walked the section along Xuanwu Lake. It's quiet on the wall, with views of Xuanwu Lake & the city. The wall is well preserved and feels quite imposing in some parts. Hard to believe they are hundreds of years old. Saw a couple of exhibits along the walk but they were only in",
          "Like a mini great wall. Very quiet and nice views. Go to the one connected to the temple also so you can knock out 2 in one.",
          "Had a great trip out to the Nanjing wall - very interesting and you can explore lots of the nooks etc - Make sure you feel the bricks inside the tunnels for hiding the soldiers in (they are warm in winter!) Well worth a trip out!",
          "This may be a false impression, but I felt the city wall was respected, not artificially preserved but allowed to stand with its own presence a reminder of power through the ages. The wall is huge, part of the modern landscape (with children playing on the top, in care of",
          "Have walked the entire walk a number of times with members of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center community. Delightful group outing. Entire walk takes anywhere from 6-10 hours, with lunch and other breaks. Some fantastic parts; some, not so.",
          "We walked from the lake to the wall and paid our 30RMB for the two of us to go onto it! not sure what that meant. Walked along the wall for about a mile, great views over the lake and parts of the city, on public holiday it was busy but not crowded busy like the rest of Nanjing",
          "The City Wall is of the ancient times that still stands till today. There are so much of additional items added where it is mixed with the contemporary. Having aid that, it is still a tourist attraction, and locals come here everyday to walk around, exercise. If you are a fan",
          "If you had a bicycle ride on the Xian wall - you'd better not to go there. Most of pieces are still under reconstruction, the reconstructed parts though are a bit far from perfect also.",
          "You need to take a small stroll on these walls as they give you a complete different view of the city of Nanjing. See temples and lakes from a (low flying) bird eye view.",
          "..... and it's in amazingly good condition. It extends a very great distance and speaks of the deep history of this extraordinary city.",
          "Like other cities Nanjing has its own wall in which from different parts of the city you can get access and depending on the side you get in you can have nice view of the city.",
          "On a sunny day it was pleasant to chill out by the walls and the moat. Very picturesque but if it was in another city it wouldn't be notable.",
          "The city wall is totally reconstructed and you can not walk along most of it - only climb to the top of one of the gate towers and look around. A couple of interesting exhibits are found within the caves of the wall. Overall, this is worth maximum an hour of your time.",
          "How did they built this magnificent structure. Walk along it and imagine what is is like hundreds of years ago. Strong winds to be expected if you go during the cooler months. Bring along warm clothing a.",
          "The wall can be visited in several different areas. In many ways it is like many of the other city walls that can be visited in China. This one gives yo a nice view because the wall is quite tall. We were here at dusk so they started closing parts of the wall. It was this",
          "Walked over to this from the Nanjing Intercontinental when a meeting finished early. It's an easy walk, straight down Beijing Street from the roundabout and the to the left when you see the big yellow temple. The Temple is beautiful, too! But don't miss out on the wall. Walk",
          "Built by the first Ming emperor 600 years ago at great expense with 200,000 laborers over 21 years, this city wall is truly magnificant and is one of the best preserved in China. The wall is beautiful by itself, but unfortunately it is currently adorned by ostentatious,",
          "Enjoy a nice stroll on the wall and visit the museum to understand this incredible structure. You can walk down to the lake and enjoy Te peach blossoms this time of the year!",
          "Take the time to see this wall if you can. Sure it's not the Great Wall, but it's less crowded and still very impressive. Note: it maybe quite difficult to get a taxi from this area.",
          "The wall at Nanjing is one of the best examples of a Chinese city wall. The intact and restroed sections are very impressive and much taller than many walls in China. The section at Jiming temple is probably the best.",
          "Nanjing's city wall is very well conservated and still exist in most if not all places. Worth a look at when you visit Nanjing...",
          "Impressive achievement but under utilized for tourism purposes, most of the wall is inaccessible. Size is more impressive than Xian, but access is not.",
          "Although the wall is just that, a huge brick wall...it is well-built and looks like it would protect to the people. It is next to a park and you can hit golf balls into the lake there.",
          "To be honest, there's not much to see - and it's a fair way out. But it's a piece of history, most interesting for its connection to the Nanjing massacre.",
          "A very nice historical place to visit. It looks that it was massively renovated (?) but it will still be worthwhile to explore. Take few pictures of the river from the top of the wall",
          "If I'm honest I found the site a little below my expectations. Interesting only for an hour or two at most with only access allowed to a small part of the site. Unless it was part of an organised tour I wouldn't go out my way o visit",
          "The architecture with it 5 layers of walls is impressive. We wre part of a tour but if we'd have been given more time we would have cycled around the walls as you can loan bikes",
          "Worth a quick trip to the south of the city but only to witness the scale of the engineering. The wall has been skillfully and tastefully restored but they really need some information about its history.",
          "I love the walls - all the different aspects. They can be be walked on many parts. My favorite walk is for Taipingmen gate, along the Xuanwo lake edge and down again at the monastery.",

          "Nanjing City Wall is another underappreciated historic site in China, the wall is not as large or well restored as Xian's but is well worth the time. It provides good views of the city- including the contrasts of modern skyscrapers and ancient pagodas- and is easy to reach",
          "This wall runs near the temple to near purple mountain on the other side. Both sides have entrances and exits. There is a small cost to get up on the wall but it is worth it. Its a nice walk if you are heading to purple mountain from the west near the temples. It offers mainly",
          "We walked the wall on a couple of occasions and did find interesting. Their is a small cost to entering the facility, but you should attempt to walk here during a cooler time of the day. It is amasing to think back in time and consider how the wall was constructed so many years",
          "While Nanjing has grown beyond it's ancient wall, the structure remains Larger than Life as sections still stand tall over neighborhoods. Whether it snakes along the rivers or rambles through the shadow of skyscrapers the wall offers views and history that is literally Solid as",
          "The site includes a museum embedded in the wall as well as miles of walks on and along the wall. The views are spectacular. My only complaint is that the museum (quite extensive) does not have anything in English. Too bad - you could really spend an hour or two just in the",

          "From what I've read, it's still the most complete ancient wall in china or the world today that is still standing strong. http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5324/ An excellent view from the top, it has 4 gates: Xuanwu, Yifeng, Yijiang, Donghua. The main gate is at",
          "Interesting and teaming with history. Kids loved the bike ride on top of the wall and also the musical stairs. Try not to go in the heat of the day, the glare and heat on top of the wall is severe. Take hats and lots of water.",
          "Worthwhile visit - take your walking shoes for a hike through a pretty garden to the tower that overlooks the old city walls. Great view of the city.",

          "The walls of Nanjing define the city as well as nearly completely encircle it. There are great views of the wall from many places, but you definitely get a better perspective by walking on it. There are good exhibits and good English explanations of various parts of the wall.",
          "well at least more authentic - worth walking along the 3k or so by Xunwa lakes and then taking a cab to the south gate which is really a bank of four gates which is in excellent condition.",
          "From this wall, you can really see the past, in the form of the Buddhist Tempe, and the present, in the form of tall, modern skyscrapers. The contrast is breathtaking.",
          "So disappointing. The wall is not preserved from littering, dirt and dog poo. They should learn from Xi'An. If you want to see a nice city wall - head to Xi'An or Beijing.",
          "This is a must see during a Nanjing visit, incredible construction built around 1400 a.c. this massive 33 km long wall around the city. Big entrances at several sides of the city were massive defensive outposts. Great work with interesting quality management (stones from",
          "The walk on the ancient city walls of Nanjing will take no more than an hour, but the views from this ancient walls are stunning. Whether you choose to look at the city, or prefer the stunning scenary of Xuanwu lake, it's worth the 10RMB entrance fee.",

          "Takes an hour or so but we really liked it. Don't miss it",

          "It's amazing to walk along such magnificent structures and the view is one to NOT be missed! I enjoyed walking along the wall and later along the lake and to the center islands. Make sure you have a good portion of the day set aside for the Jiming Temple, the Nanjing City wall",
          "On the first day we did a walk on the Wall, that is world heritage site. Nobody was on the Wall, so we had an undisturbed walk. At the end of the wall it turned out the gate is closed and we had to walk back to the original place. It was made from granite. We began at Gate of",

          "We were sorry that we did not have more time to spend on the wall. One can rent bikes and go for a bumpy spin, however, just waking along on the top was great as well. The wall is an amazing structure.",
          "During my two days I visited the city wall from two access points: Zhonghua Gate and Jiming Temple. The former provides entrance on the southern section of the wall and has the added bonus of being able to rent a bike for a small fee if you are interested. There are decent",
          "Check out the \"signed\" bricks. Apparently, if a brick failed, the maker and his supervisor were held accountable and executed!",
          "I liked the Nanjing City Wall. It was pretty cool but not overly special. You could probably have a good time having a picnic up there, and we saw a couple brides getting pictures. The view is much more impressive than Xi'an's city wall. We were just south of the lake. We got to",

        "wiki": "The Ming Palace (Chinese: \u660e\u6545\u5bab; pinyin: M\u00edng G\u00f9g\u014dng; lit.: 'Ming Former Palace'), also known as the \"Forbidden City of Nanjing\", was the 14th-century imperial palace of the early Ming dynasty, when Nanjing was the capital of China.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 14th century ===\nZhu Yuanzhang, who became the founder and first Emperor of the Ming dynasty, began building a palace in what was then known as Jiankang in 1367. At the time, he was self-styled \"King of Wu\". The palace was built outside the existing city of Jiankang, and was completed by 1368. With its completion, Zhu proclaimed the Ming Dynasty; with himself as the first emperor, known as the Hongwu Emperor; and that Jiankang, now Yingtian, was the \"southern capital\" (\"nanjing\") of his empire. For the next few years, few changes were made to the palace in Nanjing as the Emperor focused on building the \"middle capital\", located in his home town of Fengyang.\nIn 1373 the Hongwu Emperor shifted his focus back to Nanjing, with a substantial program of expansion and refurbishment of the palace which was completed in 1375. Further expansion occurred in 1392. In 1398 the Hongwu Emperor died, and was succeeded by his grandson, the Jianwen Emperor. A civil war soon ensued as Zhu Di, son of the Hongwu Emperor and uncle of the Jianwen Emperor, sought to take the crown from his nephew.\n\n\n=== 15th\u201418th centuries ===\nIn 1402, Zhu Di took Nanjing and ascended the throne as the Yongle Emperor. The Jianwen Emperor disappeared amid a fire at the imperial Ming Palace.\nThe Yongle Emperor was keen to return to Beiping (now Beijing), where he was enfeoffed as a prince. To accomplish this, he raised Beiping to the status of a second capital, adding a Jing suffix to its name - Beiping therefore became the \"northern capital\", Beijing. Zhu Di began building a palace in Beijing. The Nanjing palace lost its position as the emperor's main residence to Beijing's Forbidden City in 1420 when the Yongle Emperor officially relocated the imperial capital to Beijing. Nanjing retained the status of the \"reserve\" capital throughout the almost three centuries of the Ming era, with its own \"reserve\" court and \"reserve\" ministries, and the palace was placed in the care of officials of the Imperial Household Department. However, the palace was afflicted with a series of fires, which caused damages that were, for the most part, not repaired. In 1449, the three main halls of the Outer Court (the ceremonial seat of government) burned down and were never rebuilt. Other fires destroyed other parts of the palace.\nAfter the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebels (and, soon thereafter, to the Qing dynasty) in 1644, the Nanjing Ming Palace briefly became the seat of the Prince of Fu, who was crowned the \"Hongguang Emperor\" in Nanjing in an attempt to continue the Ming dynasty (one of a series of short-lived regimes known collectively as the Southern Ming dynasty). By this time only a small portion of the palace was intact, and the Hongguang Emperor set about rebuilding some sections of the palace.\nHowever, the following year (1645) the Qing armies reached Nanjing. The Hongguang Emperor fled and officials of the \"reserve\" court surrendered. Under the Qing dynasty, the former imperial sector of Nanjing was garrisoned by the Manchu armies of the Eight Banners, with the palace itself becoming the yamen of two military commands. Throughout the Qing dynasty, the Ming palace was gradually demolished, with stone and carvings taken away to be used as building material and decorative elements on other projects.\nBy the time of the Kangxi Emperor and the Qianlong Emperor's tours of Nanjing in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ming palace was already in ruin, and the two emperors both stayed elsewhere in the city.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nWhen the Taiping Revolution leaders declared Nanjing to be the capital of their Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, they chose not to restore the Ming Palace, but to build a new Palace of the Heavenly King. In this process, they sourced a large amount of construction material from the remains of the Ming Palace, until almost nothing remained of the buildings and walls. When the Taiping Revolution was defeated, the Qing troops razed the new palace in 1864, and built new traditional-style government buildings on that site.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe Republic of China (1912-49) established Nanjing as its capital in 1928, and transformed one of the Qing buildings into the Presidential Palace. The planned development of the capital called for a new central executive zone to be built, around the Presidential Palace, on the former Ming Palace complex grounds. The plan was never completed. In 1929, a major road, present day East Zhongshan Road, was built in an east-west direction across the palace complex site, dividing it into northern and a southern portions.\nIn the 1930s, a series of buildings were built in and around the northern portion of the palace complex site, including the offices of two Kuomintang party organs, in a \"neo-classical\" style referencing traditional palace architecture, placed symmetrically near the old east and west palace gates. The National Central Museum, the present day Nanjing Museum building, was also built in the northern section. The southern portion became a small airstrip. The building of the airstrip resulted in the demolition of the two protruding arms of the Meridian Gate, the impressive former front gate of the Ming Palace complex.\n\n\n== The Ming Palace today ==\nNo building within the palace survives today. Among other structures, the gate platforms of the Meridian Gate (the southern, front gate of the palace), Donghua Gate (the Gate of Eastern Glory, the eastern gate of the palace), and the Xi'an Gate (the Gate of Western Peace, the western outer gate of the palace) survive, though none of the wooden gatehouses survive, and the protruding wings of the Meridian Gate have been demolished. The inner and outer bridges of the Golden Water, which lie on the main north-south axis just inside and just outside the front gate respectively, survive. A number of isolated column elements and stone carvings also survive, and a number of foundations have been excavated.\nThe site of the three halls of the Outer Court has been established as a commemorative park, while the area around the Meridian Gate is also a park. Many of the remaining stone carvings and architectural components of the palace have been moved to the latter park and are arranged for display.\nLarge parts of the former palace are now occupied by various agencies and organisations such as the Aeronautical and Aerospace University of Nanjing, the Archives of the Nanjing Military District, and the No. 2 Historical Archives of China.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe palace is accessible from Minggugong Station of Nanjing Metro.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMing Palace in Beijing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScenic spots in Nanjing",

          "Nothing much to see. However, you can see the daily activity of the Nanjing people. No closing time. There is an information board to explain about the place",
          "We started with the park on the same side of the metro as this had an official looking gateway and the crowds seemed to be heading this way. This turned out to just be a locals park with some stone plinth bases scattered in the middle. At this point we were wondering why we had",

          "There is not a lot in terms of visible ruins or artifacts. But there are a few. If you are looking for a quiet, green space to sit and think, this is better than most Chinese parks. I was there on a weekend and there were some people there but it was not crowded. There were",

          "Either we went to the wrong place or the only thing left of the palace is the gatekeeper's lodge, which houses some art and artifacts. Expecting more, we went out of the back and were greeted with quite simply, gardens in which people were flying kites. Not worth the subway trip",

        "wiki": "The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, part of the former Great Bao'en Temple, is a historical site located on the south bank of external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, China. It was a pagoda constructed in the 15th century during the Ming dynasty, but was mostly destroyed in the 19th century during the course  of the Taiping Rebellion. A modern life size replica of it now exists in Nanjing.In 2010 Wang Jianlin, a Chinese businessman, donated a billion yuan (US$156 million) to the city of Nanjing for its reconstruction. This is reported to be the largest single personal donation ever made in China. In December 2015, the modern replica and surrounding park opened to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was designed during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402\u20131424), shortly after its construction in the early 15th century. It was first discovered by the Western world when European travelers like Johan Nieuhof visited it, sometimes listing it as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. After this exposure to the outside world, the tower was seen as a national treasure to both locals and other cultures around the world.\nOn 25 March 1428, the Xuande Emperor ordered Zheng He and others to take over the supervision for the rebuilding and repair of the Great Bao'en Temple at Nanjing. He completed the construction of the temple in 1431.In 1801, the tower was struck by lightning and the top four stories were knocked off, but it was soon restored. The 1843 book, The Closing Events of the Campaign in China by Granville Gower Loch, contains a detailed description of the tower as it existed in the early 1840s. In the 1850s, the area surrounding the tower erupted in civil war as the Taiping Rebellion reached Nanjing and the rebels took over the city. They smashed the Buddhist images and destroyed the inner staircase to deny the Qing enemy an observation platform. American sailors reached the city in May 1854 and visited the hollowed tower. In 1856, the Taiping destroyed the tower either in order to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties. After this, the tower's remnants were salvaged for use in other buildings, while the site lay dormant until a recent surge to try to rebuild the landmark.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe tower was octagonal with a base of about 97 feet (30 m) in diameter. When it was built, the tower was one of the largest buildings in China, rising up to a height of 260 feet (79 m) with nine stories and a staircase in the middle of the pagoda, which spiraled upwards for 184 steps. The top of the roof was marked by a golden pineapple. There were original plans to add more stories, according to an American missionary who in 1852 visited Nanjing. There are only a few Chinese pagodas that surpass its height, such as the still existent 275-foot-tall (84 m) 11th-century Liaodi Pagoda in Hebei or the no longer existent 330-foot-tall (100 m) 7th-century wooden pagoda of Chang'an.\nThe tower was built with white porcelain bricks that were said to reflect the sun's rays during the day, and at night as many as 140 lamps were hung from the building to illuminate the tower. Glazes and stoneware were worked into the porcelain and created a mixture of green, yellow, brown and white designs on the sides of the tower, including animals, flowers and landscapes. The tower was also decorated with numerous Buddhist images.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The legendary porcelain tower\".

It is 448.2 m (1467 ft) high. Its peaks are often found enveloped in purple and golden clouds at dawn and dusk, hence its name.\nA small mountain with an area of about 20 square kilometers (4,900 acres), Purple Mountain is a mountain related to many historical events of both ancient and modern China. It was originally known as Bell Mountain (traditional Chinese: \u9418\u5c71; simplified Chinese: \u949f\u5c71; pinyin: Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n) and also became known as Mount Jiang (traditional Chinese: \u8523\u5c71; simplified Chinese: \u848b\u5c71; pinyin: Ji\u01cengsh\u0101n) after Sun Quan named Jiang Ziwen, an Eastern Han official whose spirit was said to haunt the site, as the mountain's god during the Three Kingdoms era. The name Zijin (\u7d2b\u91d1) means \"copper\" - when copper is pure, it appears purple in color, so in Chinese, it is also called purple-gold. It is also named Mount Jinling (\u91d1\u9675\u5c71), due to its purple rocks. Jinling means \"the mount of purple-gold\". It is the origin of the nickname \"Jinling\" (\u91d1\u9675) of Nanjing. During the Ming dynasty, it was also called Mount Shenlie (\u795e\u70c8\u5c71).\nMore than 200 heritage and scenic tourist sites are now located in or around the mountain, including three national historical sites, nine provincial historical sites, and 33 prefectural historical sites. Located in or close to the hillside of the mountain, there are also about a dozen national research institutes and universities. The Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the tomb of Sun Yat-sen, is located at the foot of the mountain.\nPurple Mountain has 621 species of vascular plants, from 383 genera, 118 families (including 78 cultivated species).\n\n\n== See also ==\nLinggu Temple\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum\nPurple Mountain Observatory\nSun Yat-sen Mausoleum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPurple-Gold Mountain Observatory the first and largest observatory of China, in Chinese\nLocation List of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, one UNESCO World Heritage Site\nZhongshan Journal",

          "This place is great to get away from the city for a while, actually its very close to the city center, about 20 minutes taxi drive. Be ready to climb a lot of stairs though!",
          "Not good to go there on cloudy weather since you do not see nanjing city from top when it is cloudy.",
          "The mountain is big and full of many attractions. I did not hike up the mountain due to the unfavourable weather and was more interested in visiting the attractions instead. The mountain can be easily accessed via the subway- Muxuyuan (line2). The ticket counter could be found",
          "There are a series of spots and attractions in the Purple Mountain area and some shuttle buses to take you between locations as well. The most impressive spot is the Dr Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum. Climb the mountain along the stairs and the mausoleum is on the top. I went there",
          "Climb the mountain by foot, or by one of the electrical mini-buses for 10 RMB. The walk in this sub-tropical forest, lots of Bamboo trees, tiny water streams, and the Mausoleum at the top. You don't have to climb all the stairs to the top, but if you like parks and history, do",

          "The Purple Mountain area probably requires 4-6 hours depending on just how much you want to see. It has some lovely nature and architecture that should not be missed.",
          "Best place to visit, but you have to walk a lot to reach on the top. So have some drink with you for pleasant trip",
          "Great chance to exercise, like a stair-master on steroids. Beautiful setting however it lacks a lot in substance once you reach the summit. Not a special destination.",
          "In this place, you can visit lots of historical buildings, such as Sun Yat Sen mausoleum and Sun Yat Sen Museum and other buildings. It's worth to climb, even though too many people come and visit during holidays",
          "A beautiful place that I highly recommend if you enjoy nature and a great view. It also leads the the well-known Sun Yatsun Memorial.",
          "It is a huge area to cover and signage is poor and transport is confusing. Souvenir Shops are just great. The varoius areas should have better transport",

          "At least in China and moreover in Nanjjng, the Purple Mountain is a famous site for tourism. Several activities are grouped over there: Ming tomb, Sun Yat Sen Mausoleum, possibility to climb the hill to have a nice view over the city (when no smog), plum garden in spring period",

          "The cable car was creepy and unnecessary, we regretted it instantly and got off at the 1st opportunity. The walks uphill are quite nice however once you get to the top you can see haze for miles and miles at all sides. Also if you are foreign prepare to be stared at... a lot.",

          "I had only seen this in pictures and was thrilled to finally be able to visit this attraction. The walk up the stairs was tiring especially as i was unfit at the moment but absolutely worth it. the views from the top more than make up for the walk. The site is quite crowded but",

          "Absolute beautiful walk, however there's lots of stairs, but I believe there is a shuttle (probably costs) from the entrance to the bottom of the main stairway.",
          "This is a lovely place to go for a walk in pleasant woods and with great views at the end. I enjoyed this very much. Well worth a few hours walking around the area.",
          "The are really a lot of stairs so be prepared! The view is amazing though. We didn't manage to climb all the way up because it was the middle of summers with temperatures around 40 degrees, no shade... But still enjoyed it!",
          "This is a real neat place. We made the main hike up the stairs, wish we had more time to see more of the area (there seems to be soooo much more to explore. Only downside is summer time in China - about 90F and 300000% humidity (true story)",

          "A nice place to go for a walk and good that it is that close to the city. We went on saturday and there were many singing groups",
          "Extremely well preserved area with Ming Tomb, SYS Mausoleum and a number of other memorials/tombs of founding members of modern China. Efficient golf carts go around the area, which are some 5-10 minutes apart.",
          "This was a pretty nice visit, though it was a cloudy day. I had read online about several temples and sites, such as Dr. Sun's mausoleum that were on Purple Mountain. However, we didn't see any of these things; I'm not sure if there are different routes and down the mountain,",
          "This is the lovely park to visit there is a little train that can take you around as well, there is many steps to reach the top so you really need to be reasonably fit. There are toilets at the top, The view is beautiful, you will need a few hours to enjoy this Park.",
          "I rated this four stars, but it is not a destination in-and-of itself. Trip Advisor often presents the same site in multiple ways, which may lead you to believe they are separate destinations. Such is the case here. This is more of a locale in which actual spots are located. You",

          "I went to the top of the mountain with a cable car, and the journey was scary to be honest. It's like an open cable car, so you can feel the wind, and the trees if it's tall enough. On the top of it you will see the beautiful scenery of Nanjing city and some observatories but",

          "The cable car ride is nice but do not expect great scenery; not well looked after. The top is much the same, not much to see, everything was quite unkempt. Other parts of the mountain itself is much better; so if you don't have the time, skip the cable car.",

          "Beautiful park, you can take a strenuous hike and get some great views. If it is smoggy, the view is quite diminished.",
          "Went out to Purple Mountain - interesting but really too busy to enjoy! The leaves are just starting to turn red but it is difficult to walk up the mountain as so many people are jostling to also do the same thing. A long way out - so probably wouldn't bother again!",
          "I can't express the experience of being on the mountain, such a tribute to intelligent environmental care as well as to natural beauty. I was fortunate to have a moderate autumn day for my visit, and the mountain governs the mausoleum and monuments.",
          "392 steps up to the top! Chinese visit regularly. Great food court. Fresh delicious cheap food. Lovely parks to walk around. VEry enjoyable to get out of the smoggy city for a while, into some cleaner (?) air!",
          "We absolutely loved this experience. It was a bit of a walk for my husband who has a disability so if you can I would take a taxi up to the cable car, taxis are very reasonable. Being Europeans we were a bit of a \"sight\" to the local people but they were very friendly and funny.",

          "Overall it is nice place to visit - green and easy to reach from the city center. But as you are not the only one who want to visit it - beware of the crowds in the area. It is nice to go up the mountain - the higher you go the less people it shall be - so if you are after some",
          "The mountain ha s three quite interesting attractions on it and is quite a pretty natural hill. The tombs and the temple are pretty good and the mountain is definitely worth visiting while in Nanjing. The main problem, as you would expect, is that it is totally overrun with",
          "The perfect place to get away from the hussle of the city and stroll through wide forests. The mausoleums and temples are impressive and give you a beautiful insight in Chinese culture and history. The view from the pagoda is also worth climbing the stairs to the top.",

          "A super long cableway from the foot of the mountain to the top - 40 mins! Other than the mountain was over crowded by locals, it is almost covered in litter and trash - Chinese really have no relationship and any sense of preservation to their natural beauties",
          "Only 15 mins from Nanjing city this is an amazing place to visit. The park is beautiful and peaceful, there are no beggars or people harassing you and the historic value is worth the visit.",
          "Plan on walking a lot, but well worth it. One of our highlights of China",
          "I enjoyed walking around, reading about the grounds and discovering the mountain. I am not one to take a tour, a bus or taxi. I much prefer to see things at my own pace and I spent many hours on Zijin Shan. I am glad that I did and went back as I was not able to see it all in",
          "Great place to spend the whole day exploring. The Sun Yat sen Mausoleum tends to be really crowded, its better to start there early in the morning, and then move to the other sites which tend to have a fraction of the number of people",

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity.

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity. The YOG aims to spread the Olympic spirit and encourage sports participation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe city is renowned for its wide variety of architectures which mainly contain buildings from multiple dynasties, the Republic of China, and the present.\n\n\n=== Imperial period ===\n\n\n==== Inside the walled city ====\nCity Wall of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u57ce\u5899)\nGate of China (Zhonghuamen; \u4e2d\u534e\u95e8)\nFuzimiao (Confucius Temple) and Qinhuai River (\u5357\u4eac\u592b\u5b50\u5e99 \u79e6\u6dee\u6cb3)\nJiangnan Examination Hall (\u6c5f\u5357\u8d21\u9662)\nZhanyuan Garden (\u77bb\u56ed)\nOld Gate East (Laomendong) (\u8001\u95e8\u4e1c)\nTaoye Ferry (\u6843\u53f6\u6e21)\nMing Palace Site (\u660e\u6545\u5bab)\nXu Garden (\u7166\u56ed)\nJiming Temple (\u9e21\u9e23\u5bfa)\nBeiji Ge (\u5317\u6781\u9601)\nDrum Tower of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u9f13\u697c)\nChaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bab)\nStone City (\u77f3\u5934\u57ce)\nYuejiang Tower (\u9605\u6c5f\u697c)\nJinghai Temple (\u9759\u6d77\u5bfa)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Outside the walled city ====\nPurple Mountain Scenic Area (\u7d2b\u91d1\u5c71)\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum and its surrounding complex (\u660e\u5b5d\u9675)\nLinggu Temple (\u7075\u8c37\u5bfa)\nXuanwu Lake (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56)\nQixia Temple (\u6816\u971e\u5bfa)\nThe Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing (restored) (\u5927\u62a5\u6069\u5bfa\u7409\u7483\u5854)\nMochou Lake and Park (\u83ab\u6101\u6e56)\nYangshan Quarry (\u9633\u5c71\u7891\u6750)\nSouthern Tang Mausoleums (\u5357\u5510\u4e8c\u9675)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Republic of China period ===\nBecause it was designated as the national capital, many structures were built around that time.

          "Like a lot of similar places in many cities now in China, it tries to bring back the old time with food and novelty, ... and when it is successful, crowd as well.",
          "Nothing really stands out here, but it was an enjoyable place to spend two or three hours. There are several attractions close together, all of which are quite good - the Confucius temple, with its exhibits on Confucius' life; the museum about the Imperial Academy, which is",
          "Once you have walked down the street there isn't a lot compared to the various markets or Yu gardens area. Still interesting particularly the Imperial Examinations rooms.",
          "The whole area is interesting and colourful. The former site for the Imperial Examinations is of course of great historical interest. Alas the area is otherwise very much like many similar places in China - a giant commercial enterprise.",
          "He is well known in Chinese history n must teach in text book! It was quite interesting how \u201ccheating\u201d was done thousands years ago compared to now!",
          "Another wonderful location to visit. Highly recommend. Lots of great people watching and things to do here",
          "I was told the Confucian Temple Area is a must-visit place but when I was there, I was shocked as it is too touristic and extremely crowded. I don't recommend this.",
          "Sure, during the Golden Week it was busy ... very busy, sharing the area with many thousands of people. Still, a very interesting shopping experience.",
          "This is an outstanding place!! We will be going back. One definitely needs the whole day to fully enjoy!!",
          "It\u2019s best to arrive in late afternoon (5-6pm) and purchase boat tickets to ride at dusk 6:30. some reviews said boat ride was just ok... The boat ride made this place! Absolutely loved seeing it at dusk and then while still on the boat ride it becomes dark with everything lit",
          "The pictures does not do justice to the beauty of that area , it is a must visit area in Nanjing. Very welcoming people and tourist shops at reasonable prices (many were having sale at time of our visit ) at every corner, not to mention various type of food catering for all",

I love the canal especially at night when you can stroll along the river after a nice dinner. \u6c89\u9189\u5728\u53e4\u8857,\u6b23\u8d4f\u79e6\u6dee\u6cb3.Too bad the two days I was there mostly were raining (affected by Typhoon Lekima). But I",

          "This is a paradise of all things China shopping. There are TONS of different vendors (perfect for little gifts to take back home) and many different food shops. Remember, it is okay to barter here so that you get the best deal. Lots of different places to shop and eat.",
          "While walking around my hotel after dinner, I passed by the Confucius Temple and decided to walk in. Admittance fee is just 30 RMB and worth the money. Well maintained, a lot of things to see. Outside the temple was bustling, but inside quiet and peaceful.",
          "The temple is located in a restored old street full of shops and restaurants that create a vivid atmosphere; inside the temple the manifestations of folk religion are very impressive trees especially the trees with the various red talismans. You can take a boat trip from the",
          "A lot of walking around, there is just so much to see. Do also take the boat tour, the evening one is more expensive but it\u2019s a 40 min ride with a great view of the beautifully lit Qianhuai river view.",
          "Whole thing is a fake, make of concrete and made to look old. Speaking to guide they do not even know if a temple actually stood there at all, so it\u2019s just a fake tourist attraction , I would give this a miss and go straight to rape of nanking museum",
          "Very crowded with local Chinese tourist, lots eatery, the river view is excellent especially at night, so go both day n night, highly recommended.",
          "I was taken to spend an afternoon in this area of Nanjing and thoroughly enjoyed looking at all the buzzing activities going on. There are a number of artisans creating jewellery, sweets, herbs and spices and crafts. I highly recommend a visit here.",
          "Beautiful and clean area, perfect for taking photos of Chinese architecture. Fuzi Mao is situated 10 min walking distance from Holiday inn hotel. I would recommend visiting before noon and bringing umbrellas. At night, depending on festivities season, the area is illuminated",
          "Visited here in search of some shopping/ flea markets. Very busy area with all the big name shops and also side streets packed with local treats. Reasonable prices and lots of options for food. Grest day out and a must see in Nanjing.",
          "This confusian temple is a lot better than the one in Qufu. It has nice panels depicting the life and actions of Confucius. Also the statue is nice. Admission is 30 rmb. Definitely recommend. The neighbourhood is full of souvenir shops, restaurants and street food. It's right by",
          "Fuzi Miao is a place you might just have to visit to complete the experiences in Nanjing. It is noisy, crowded and very touristy but it is lovely at night, with tons of choices of regional food (Yumm!!) and a great place to buy some souvenir. My advice is to visit at night",
          "Touristy, but worth it. Lots of small stalls in the market, temple visit is good to do. Eating is a good experience. Quite crowded an dlots of people around. Good for getting those cheesy souvenirs for home.",
          "The whole area is extremely well developed, neat and clean, and beautifully decorated. The place is full of life, with lots of revelers and tourists, and a great place to visit. Chinese traditional music was playing and adding to the grand sites all around, the river / canal",
          "Great small temple, relating all the history of Confucius. Not as ancient as it pretend to be but definitely worth a visit.",
          "If you want to experience a spacious Chinese attraction with great gift shopping possibilities, this is good. All the lights in the evening were nice but really there is nothing much to do.",
          "Its a temple build in remembrance of Confucius. Located along Qin Huai old street. Entrance fees applicable, it also showcase art piece description of the life story of Confucius, the philosopher, wise man of ancient China. There's an academy museum inside too, showing teaching",

          "We visited in August 2018, be warned it is uncomfortably hot at that time of year and there is not much to do indoors in this area, so be wary of the weather before you visit. The area itself consists of the temple, souvenir shops, some average street food and a LOT of",
          "Enjoyed the museum for Examination for scholars. The place was the actual site where the examination was held. The museum took about 3-4 hours to complete-4 floors of exploration!",
          "Crowds start to gather in the later part of the morning, so go early if you want fewer people in your photos, and the whole street to yourself. Shops don't open so early, but you can walk around the river and the old houses first.",
          "Just back from a business trip to Nanjing and during my time I visited the Confucian Temple. What a lovely place to visit with a lot of history. Within the area there are a number of building to see and go into but many you have to pay for individually for entrance. Added to",
          "One of the very famous spots in Nanjing. Take a walk around to collect the impressions. There are various food styles available - you won't leave hungry. Although it is quite impressive at daylight, you should go there in the evening. I really liked all the illumination , take a",

          "The Confucious Temple (or \u592b\u5b50\u5e99) was highly recommended by many. My personal take is that it has become a tourist trap with no unique features. E.g., The temple is no longer a functional temple or even museum, rather, it is now like a performing stage. Also, there are no unique",
          "My local friend took us to a famous local restaurant near the Carpark in front of the scholar hotel. Compared with the river front area this is less crowded. The waitress recommended us some Nanjing food. When we wanted to order a lot more, she suggested we try fewer dishes",
          "If you have visited Suzhou then this particular place would be a disappointment. It is very commercialized and just another pedestrian street to promote selling of merchandises. If you enjoy decent or authentic Chinese food, please stay away from the food stalls or cafeteria",
          "Probably one of the few places in Nanjing that I would recommend a tourist going to. This a great area with a good mix of fun and history. Here you can visit the Confucius temple, the imperial examination museum, try lots of different types of food and also do some light",
          "The Confucian temple area consists of a temple and plenty of shops and food outlets. It is a tourist hot spot, mostly Chinese tourist. The temple is nice. The shops are so, so. The street food taste good but be careful, it may come back and bite you.",
          "this place has a lot to offer, including cultural and food experience. nice stop when you're at Nanjing.",
          "I visited with some local friends, can\u2019t feel the ancient time there. Way too much commercialised, only food and shopping shops can be seen. Not worth visiting.",
          "I know there is a temple area here, but we were at the fag end of our day and the focus was to get \"representative souvenirs\" from the area. This was a great place to do that. There are modern shopping markets, but right behind the temple itself there are the more traditional",
          "The temple itself is amazing, as are some of the surrounding historical structures. Great shopping area surrounding the temple complex. Really pretty spot right next to the river. Very much recommend....especially during the evening.",

          "Must try the salty duck which is the famous delicacies here. I would recommend the one with green color packing and halal certified. There are a lot small food outlets, you may fill up your stomach while walking around this area. I prefer the night view.",

          "I went to Fuzi Miao one evening and I wasn\u2019t impressed. It came across more of a tourist trap with overpriced shops and restaurants.",
          "This was our regular evening haunt. Full of colour, vibrant and exciting. Lots of shopping, lots of food. Must mention the shop in my picture, please try their flatbreads they are great.",
          "Most of the buildings are actually new,and the crowded people don't care about Confucius at all.The real impressive things are the street snacks.",
          "There are so many things to see here. The temple itself is worth the trip, but the surrounding shops and architecture is what I loved the most. It seemed a bit touristy, but because there were few westerners, I still felt I was getting a Chinese experience.",
          "i agree with some comments that theres no confucius encounter of any of that sort..i feel its a night market..we came on chinese new year,so theres a very loud disco music playing nonstop and a light display in one of the building there..around the place were surrounded by many",
          "Came here during the Chinese New Year period so it was very festive with the decorations and the crowds. Spent about 1.5 hour here, didn't learn anything Confucian at all.",
          "Fantastic place to go for appreciating the culture, shopping and nightlife. The place looks absolutely stunning once it gets dark, it's beautifully lit and - if you're there just for one short second and then go back to your life in The Western Hemisphere - makes you absolutely",
          "You can pay 10 yuan or more to strike a bell several times or you can light some incense which you also need to buy, then you will get blessed (by Confucius?). When did it become a religious shrine and a tool to make money?",
          "A great place to spend a day just walking and feeling serene. Everything is well kept and there are a lot of locals dancing, doing yoga or just relaxing. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited this place one late afternoon around the first week of December. The place comes alive in the evening when they turn the decorative lanterns along the river on. Crowded but well worth the visit. Aside from strolling down the old street lined with one too many shops",
          "This was one of the most famous place to visit in Nanjing, but now just a flee market. The buildings still look okay, but all they are selling junks. That makes the entire area looks really low. There are some good restaurants in the area though. If you are looking for some",
          "Prepare your self if you decided to visit Confucian Temple with walks lots of distance. Use your best shoes to walk. Plenty of food stalls in a long way road, souvenirs stalls, full of people, very nice to see around especially inside of the Confucian Temple that cost you \u00a530",
          "Too crowded though. But plenty of food options and souvenirs to purchase. Nan sold was very delicious. Which seem to have derived from Indian nan bread.",
          "But crowded. Like most you'll see in China. It's still similar to most of the ancient towns there. The surrounding and residential area, though, is quiet and nice. Worth a walk along the canals.",
          "The place is well restored and commercialised. Located right at the heart of the city central. The \u79e6\u6deeriver cut across the place. Beautiful for photography.",
          "On of the bigger Confucian temples I visited in my travels. Its a few blocks from the Lao Mendong. You wont miss this, if you cross bridges your near to this place. On the outside you will see a riverside teaming with boats where you can hire to enjoy a lea surly cruise up an",
          "We made a point to visit the Mauseleum as it is for a human with spirirual achievements achievable only with discipline and perseverance. Confucius has taught us to seek the light. The many visitors do not allow for meditation within the grounds.",
          "A \"temple\" to remember the great thinker, philosopher and teacher. Well-curated display of all things related to Confucius and some of his disciples. If you are visting the area including the Confucian Temple, you should leave this to be the last because the other attractions",
          "Buildings are the only authentic feature at this tourist spot. Shops, restaurants, souvenir stores are all commercialised. Products are of shoddy quality. Service is poor and in some cases non-existent. A shop keeper kept speaking on the cell phone while I stood in chilly wind",
          "Yes it'll probably be busy, noisy and maybe even frantic when you go here but that's because it's a worthwhile tourist attraction. So don't expect tranquility and enlightenment. Instead expect all kinds of food, shopping and old street buildings and canals. The food ranges from",
          "This provides insight into Chinese history (if you visit the temple), shopping opportunities from trash to high-class souvenirs and good food. During our only free evening in Nanjing, we went for the temple visit, a stroll through the shops and dinner, and thoroughly enjoyed our",
          "Very very good. Good good if you like chinesse food. The rice is ok and also The chiken and the pork.",
          "Beautiful, grand temple in the centre. Once you have visited, take a look at the surrounding shops - not to be missed.",
          "The temple is nice worth to watch is the whole are with shops and a lot of restaurants. You can make some scenic boat trips from there as well.",
          "Highly educational about confuciusism. Great architecture and well documented English translations. Must see for 30 Yuan.",
          "I call the area old town Nanjing. Confucius temple is the center. After you have a look at the temple, visit the surrounding area",
          "Temple was interesting but the area was a little too touristy for my liking. Found it interesting but lacking heart.",
          "The neighbourhood in general is very touristical (a bit too much so perhaps) but the Confucian Temple itself is a great place to visit.",
          "Confucius Temple is interesting. But what is more stunning is the area surrounding it. An excellent area to see the classical Chinese architecture and enjoy living in it. Lots of shops, cafes and restaurant are located in this area.",
          "Visit at night - brilliant, located in middle of town by the river, a really interesting visit This is must if visiting Nanjing Highly recommended",
          "I was looking forward to visiting the Fuzi Miao Confucius Temple Area and was expecting it to be very similar to other \u2018old\u2019 style towns I\u2019ve visited in China. Whilst normally quite commercial these areas are normally a lot of fun, and a good place to pick up some tasty street",
          "I highly recommend visiting this place in nanjing. Not only is there the distinct Chinese historical style but there is also a sense of modern chic with cute and quirky places tucked away in every laneway and corner. There are a myriad of unique shops and cafes and I really",
          "We saw this temple as we were walking on the city wall from Zhonghua Gate. After walking to the end of the wall, we walked down the stairs and walked to the temple. The grounds were beautiful and we knew we came at the perfect time because only one boat out of at least 50 was",
          "My understanding was that the actual Confucius Temple was destroyed and the current building is a recent rebuild. The area located within the walls of ancient Nanjing adjacent to the Qinhuai river is essentially a tourist commercial area. Rather quiet in the day but a visit at",
          "Not exactly our cup of tea but we enjoyed it! My husband and I have been living in China and have seen a lot like this.. So if you have already been to an area where there is a temple and shopping areas you may not be impressed like us, but if you havent itt is something you",

With an area of 70,000 square metres (17 acres), it is one of the largest museums in China.  The museum has over 400,000 items in its permanent collection, making it one of the largest in China.  Especially notable is the museum's enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Nanjing Museum was one of the first museums established in China. The predecessor of the Nanjing Museum was the preparatory department of the National Central Museum, which established in 1933. The museum took over 12.9 hectares (32 acres) in the Half Hill Garden of Zhongshan Gate. Cai Yuanpei, the first preparatory president of the council of the museum, proposed building three major halls, named \"Humanity,\" \"Craft\" and \"Nature\". Because of China's political instability in the 1930s, only the Humanity Hall was built. During the Japanese invasion, part of its collections were transferred to Southwest China, and in the end moved to the National Palace Museum in Taipei when the Kuomintang lost the Chinese Civil War. The historian Fu Sinian and anthropologist and archaeologist Li Ji were once preparatory presidents, and the archaeologist and museologist Zeng Zhaoyu was the first female president and also a founder of Nanjing Museum. In 1999 and 2009, extensions were built to the museum.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nThe main building was designed by Liang Sicheng in the 1930s combining Chinese and Western architectural styles. The front section is structure of traditional style and features a golden tiled roof. In the back is a Western-style flat-roof structure. Added in the 1990s to the west of the main building is an art hall which references Chinese architecture of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n== Exhibition halls ==\nThere are twelve exhibition halls at the museum. A highlight of the collection is a full-size suit of armor made from small jade tiles held together by silver wire.\n\nQin Garden\nEarthen Ware Hall\nTreasure Hall\nFolk Art Hall\nBronze Ware Hall\nMing and Qing Porcelain Hall\nWu Weishan Sculpture Hall\nAncient Paintings Hall\nModern Art Hall\nJiangnan Silk Product Hall\nJade Hall\nLacquer Hall\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lacquer ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNanjing Municipal Museum\nList of museums in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Chinese and English)",

        "wiki": "Mochou Lake (\u83ab\u6101\u6e56, M\u00f2 Ch\u00f3u H\u00fa, literally No Worry Lake or No Unhappieness Lake) is located west to Qinhuai River and Hanzhongmen Gate in Nanjing, China, inside Mochou Lake Park. The lake is named after Mochou, a legendary woman known for her beauty, versatility, virtue and loyalty. It was named Hengtang in ancient times, and also known as Stone City Lake.  The lake park was owned by Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of Ming dynasty, and bestowed to his general Xu Da. Since then, it has become a famous garden best known for its two-storied Shenggi Pavilion. Within the park are other pavilions, gardens, pools and a stunning rock display. It is noted for its architecture, collection of carved antique rosewood furniture and calligraphies. Visitors can take boats allow through the lotus blossomed lake.  \n\n\n== Tales of Mochou ==\n\nThe name of Mochou Lake originated from a beautiful woman called Mochou, which means \"do not worry\" in Chinese, from the Liang dynasty who committed suicide to prevent herself from being married to an undesirable man.Another tale has it that Mochou was a beautiful and virtuous woman who lived during the Northern and Southern Dynastyies(386-589). She was married and had a child. Her happy life was disrupted when her husband was conscripted into the army. No news of her husband came even after months of his leaving for the front. Mochou grew sadder with each passing day. Finally, unable to shake off the grief of separating from her husband, she turned into a lake, with the hope of flowing to her husband. The lake was named after this woman, as a tribute to her unflagging love and devotion to her husband.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSince the early Ming Dynasty, Mochou Lake was gradually developed into a famous garden, which was bestowed to Xu Da by the Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of Ming Dynasty, because he won his majesty while playing chess. Chinese folklore tells that the emperor and the general played the game regularly, and although the general was a great player, he always lost intentionally so as not to offend the emperor. Before long Emperor Taizu discovered the general's habit and ordered him to play normally. Needless to say, the general won. But while playing the general skillfully displayed the character 'wan sui,' meaning 'long life'. This feat pleased the emperor so much that he instantly gave Shengqi ('winning the game') Pavilion along with the Mochou Lake to his general During the following dynasty, this garden was extended several times and many other pavilions were added.Since 1929 Mochou Lake has been known as Mochou Lake Park. In 1953, Mochou Lake Park underwent major restorations, and the waterside pavilion and ready for ferry pavilion were built. The statue of Mochou was remodeled as well.\n\n\n== Park ==\n\nIt lies outside Shuixi Gate of Nanjing City, with a total area of 47 hectares and a circumference of 5 km. In Qing Dynasty, it was a beautiful garden that was also famed as the first attraction of Nanjing. Mochou Lake was once part of Yangtze River. Later the channels of Yangtze River and Qin Huai River changed their carrying capacity and direction, so Mochou Lake gradually became a lake.The park is a collection of pools, gardens, and pavilions, and a stunning rock display. Perhaps the most well-known feature of the park is the Shengqi Pavilion. It is a two-storied structure redolent of the austere architecture of ancient China. The first floor of the pavilion houses paintings and calligraphies created by famous artists. On the second floor the most conspicuous sight is of a picture depicting the emperor and Xu Da engrossed in a game of Weiqi that led to the emperor bestowing Shengqi ('winning the game') Pavilion along with the Mochou Lake to his general.North of the Shengqi Pavilion lies Mochou's former house. It is called Yujin Hall, after yujin, which means white cardamom. The hall is partitioned by a pond in which grow lilies. The pond is adorned by a  2 metres (6.6 ft) marble statue of Mochou, which stands in the middle of the pond. The statue's sorrowful expression is a reminder of that woman's tragic life. The pond is surrounded by cloistered pavilions.A large collection of ornately carved antique rosewood Chinese furniture is exhibited in one of the courtyards.The lake is situated behind the pavilion. Lotuses cover the lake, and when they are in bloom, they present a wonderful sight. There is an island in the lake's middle that can be reached by boat.\n\n\n== Events ==\nMochou Lake Park celebrates Duanwu Festival each year with a dragon boat race.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Chinese gardens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (Chinese)\nThe Mochou Lake and Story of Lady Mochou - MILDCHINA",

      "name": "John Rabe House",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "John Heinrich Detlef Rabe (23 November 1882 \u2013 5 January 1950) was a German businessman and Nazi Party member who is best known for his efforts to stop the atrocities of the Japanese army during the Nanking occupation and his work to protect and help the Chinese civilians during the event.  The Nanking Safety Zone, which he helped to establish, sheltered approximately 200,000 Chinese people from slaughter during the massacre.\nHe officially represented Germany and acted as senior chief of the European\u2013U.S. establishment that remained in Nanking (now Nanjing), the Chinese capital at the time, when the city fell to the Japanese troops.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in Hamburg on 23 November 1882, Rabe pursued a career in business and went to Africa for several years. In 1908 he left for China, and between 1910 and 1938, he worked for the Siemens AG China Corporation in Mukden, Peking, Tientsin, Shanghai and later Nanjing. Rabe suffered from diabetes by the time he was working in Nanking, which required him to have his regular dose of insulin. At the time of the Japanese attack on Nanking, Rabe was a staunch Nazi and the party's local head, as a Deputy Group Leader in the Nazi Party.\n\n\n== Establishment of the Nanjing Safety Zone ==\n\nMany Westerners were living in the Chinese capital city of the time as Nanking was, until December 1937, conducting trade or on missionary trips. As the Japanese army approached Nanking and initiated bombing raids on the city, all but 22 foreigners fled the city, with 15 American and European missionaries and businessmen forming part of the remaining group. On 22 November 1937, as the Japanese Army advanced on Nanking, Rabe, along with other foreign nationals, organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone and created the Nanking Safety Zone to provide Chinese refugees with food and shelter from the impending Japanese slaughter.  He explained his reasons thus: \"\u2026there is a question of morality here\u2026  I cannot bring myself for now to betray the trust these people have put in me, and it is touching to see how they believe in me.\" The zones were located in all of the foreign embassies and at Nanking University.\nThe International Committee was inspired by the establishment in November of a neutral zone in Shanghai, which protected 450,000 civilians.Rabe was elected as its leader, in part because of his status as a member of the Nazi party and the existence of the German\u2013Japanese bilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. This committee established the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city. The Japanese government had agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces, and the members of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone attempted to persuade the Chinese government to move all their troops out of the area.  They were partly successful.\nOn 1 December 1937, Nanjing Mayor Ma Chao-chun ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanking to move into the Safety Zone and then fled the city. By the fall of Nanjing on 13 December 1937, 500,000 non-combatants remained in the city.Rabe also opened up his properties to help 650 more refugees.\n\n\n== Nanking Massacre ==\n\nAccording to Rabe, the Nanking Massacre resulted in the deaths of 50,000 to 60,000 civilians. Rabe and his zone administrators tried frantically to stop the atrocities. Modern estimates vary, but some put the number of murdered civilians as high as 300,000. Rabe's attempts to appeal to the Japanese by using his Nazi Party membership credentials only delayed them; but that delay allowed hundreds of thousands of refugees to escape. The documentary Nanking credited him for saving the lives of 250,000 Chinese civilians.  Other sources suggest that Rabe rescued between 200,000 and 250,000 Chinese people. In his diary Rabe documented Japanese atrocities committed during the assault upon and occupation of the city.John Rabe gave a series of lectures in Germany after he came back to Berlin on 15 April 1938, in which he said, \"We Europeans put the number [of civilian casualties] at about 50,000 to 60,000.\" Rabe was not the only figure to record the Japanese atrocity. By December 1937, after the defeat of the Chinese soldiers, the Japanese soldiers would often go house-to-house in Nanking, shooting any civilians they encountered. Evidence of these violent acts come from diaries kept by some Japanese soldiers and by Japanese journalists who were appalled by what was transpiring.\n\n\n== Return to Germany ==\nOn 28 February 1938, Rabe left Nanking. He first traveled to Shanghai and then back to Germany. He took with him a large number of source materials documenting the atrocities committed by the Japanese in Nanking.Rabe showed films and photographs of Japanese atrocities in lecture presentations in Berlin and wrote to Hitler to use his influence to persuade the Japanese to stop any further inhumane violence. As a result, Rabe was detained and interrogated by the Gestapo and his letter was never delivered to Hitler. Due to the intervention of Siemens AG, Rabe was released. He was allowed to keep evidence of the massacre, excluding the film, but was not allowed to lecture again or write on the subject. Rabe continued working for Siemens, which posted him briefly to the safety of Siemens AG of Afghanistan. Rabe subsequently worked in the Berlin headquarters of the company until the end of the war.\n\n\n== Postwar ==\nAfter the war, Rabe was arrested first by the Soviet NKVD and then by the British Army. Both, however, let him go after intense interrogation. He worked sporadically for Siemens, earning very little. He was later denounced for his Nazi Party membership by an acquaintance. He was stripped of the work permit that he had previously been given by the British Zone, and had to undergo a very lengthy de-nazification process (his first attempt was rejected and he had to appeal) in the hope of regaining the permission to work. He had to pay his own legal defense costs, which depleted his savings.Unable to work to support his family and with the savings spent the family survived in a one-room apartment by selling his Chinese art collection, but this did not provide enough to avoid malnutrition. He was formally declared \"de-Nazified\" by the British on 3 June 1946 but thereafter continued to live in poverty.  The family lived on wild seeds that the children would eat with soup and on dry bread until that was no longer available either.In 1948, the citizens of Nanking learned of the very dire situation of the Rabe family in occupied Germany and they quickly raised a very large sum of money, equivalent to $2,000 USD ($21,000 in 2020). The city mayor himself went to Germany, via Switzerland where he bought a large amount of food for the Rabe family. From mid-1948 until the communist takeover the people of Nanking also sent a food package each month, for which Rabe wrote many letters expressing deep gratitude.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\nOn 5 January 1950, Rabe died of a stroke. In 1997 his tombstone was moved from Berlin to Nanjing (as it is now) where it received a place of honor at the massacre memorial site. \nIn 2005, Rabe's former residence in Nanking (as it then was) was renovated and now accommodates the \"John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\", which opened in 2006. The Austrian Service Abroad was invited to send a Peace Servant.His grave in Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Cemetery in Berlin-Charlottenburg was re-erected in 2013.\n\n\n== War diaries ==\nHis war-time diaries were published in English as The Good German of Nanking (UK title) or The Good Man of Nanking (US title) (original German title: Der gute Deutsche von Nanking).\n\n\n== Portrayals in film ==\nJohn Rabe has been portrayed in numerous films:\n\nIn Mou Tun Fei's 1995 film Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre. Minnie Vautrin and George Ashmore Fitch are also depicted.\nIn Wu Ziniu's 1995 film Don't Cry, Nanking, actor Ulrich Ottenburger played Rabe, although his name was changed to \"John Robbins.\"\nIn Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman's 2007 documentary film Nanking, actor J\u00fcrgen Prochnow played Rabe.\nIn Lu Chuan's 2009 film City of Life and Death, actor John Paisley played Rabe.\nIn Florian Gallenberger's film John Rabe, also released in 2009, Ulrich Tukur played John Rabe.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nErwin Wickert (editor).

        "wiki": "Xuanwu Lake (Chinese: \u7384\u6b66\u6e56; pinyin: Xu\u00e1nw\u01d4 h\u00fa) is located in Xuanwu District in the central-northeast part of Nanjing, Jiangsu. It is near the Nanjing Railway Station and Ji Ming Temple. Five islands within the lake are interconnected by arched bridges. Within the park are temples, pagodas, pavilions, gardens, teahouses, restaurants, entertainment venues, a small zoo, and other attractions. Its main entrance is the Xuanwu Gate.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lake was formed, according to geologists, when tectonic plates shifted and created Mount Yanshan. A legend is that Emperor Sun Quan (182\u2013252) settled in the Nanjing area and he had the lake created and filled with water. The lake was named for a black dragon, believed to be a water god by Chinese Taoists, from a Southern dynasty (420-859) legend. The dragon, seen in the lake, looked like a tortoise and a snake and was named Xuanwu, meaning black tortoise.During the Six Dynasties period (222\u2013859) a garden on a basaltic site was created, which is now considered one of the most scenic places in the park. The area was used for hunting and training by the emperor's family members.Also called \"Military Rehearsal Lake\", the lake was used for naval battle exercises during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). The \"Yellow Book Storage\", or the \"Yellow Register Archives\", was built there in the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), and it was thus made an imperial garden and \"forbidden land\".The lake and surrounding area was made into a park in 1911 after the end of the Qing dynasty. It was renamed from Yuanwu Lake Park to \"Continental Park\" in 1928 and officially made Xuanwu Lake Park in 1935. A plan was made for the 2005 creation of the Li Yu Cultural Park, Garden Park, Qingyinge pavilion and an immortality garden.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe main entrance to the Xuanwu Lake Park is through Xuanwu Gate, which is part of the Nanjing City Wall that borders the south and east portions of the park and Ji Ming Temple is in its southwestern area. The Zifeng Tower overlooks the lake. The 444 hectare lake is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) in circumference.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Park ==\nXuanwu Lake Park (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56\u516c\u56ed), once an imperial lake garden, is now a city park. In the spring, the pink cherry blossom trees are in bloom. Summer visitors experience emerald lotus leaves, flowers, and \"a peaceful haven of weeping willows\" followed by red maples and golden ginkgos in the fall. Arch bridges connect five islands. The \"Autumn Chrysanthemum of Liang Islet\" has the Lake God Temple, Wenji Pavilion, the Peony Garden, Bonsai Museum, and a fish pond. The \"Flowers Sea of Ying Islet\" is sanctuary to more than 200 rare species of birds. An entertainment venue, including a bandstand, is located on \"Green Islet.\" The \"Willows and Smokes of Huanzhou Islet\" has a playground for children. The fifth island is the \"Clouds and Mists of Ling Islet\".Within the scenic park are pagodas, pavilions, tea houses, and restaurants. Entertainment options include boating, zoo, and an outdoor theatre. Key attractions include the Nuo\u2019na tower, Lama Temple, cenotaph of Guo Pu, and the Rose Garden. On the lake are boats and ferries. It is also considered the \"Pearl of the Stone City\". If desired, a visitor could stroll through the park for up to five hours.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nIt is designated a National Grade AAAA Attraction. The City of Nanjing has identified it as one of the top five parks in the city. Others are Mochou Lake Park, Qingliangshan Park, Wuchaomen Park and China Gate Castle Park.Nanjing's Couple Park, or Qingl\u00fcyuan Xuanwu (\u5357\u4eac\u60c5\u4fa3\u56ed), is adjacent to the western edge of Xuanwu Lake and behind the Nanjing International Exhibition Center.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site (Chinese)\nXuanwu Lake Park map (Chinese)",

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity. The YOG aims to spread the Olympic spirit and encourage sports participation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe city is renowned for its wide variety of architectures which mainly contain buildings from multiple dynasties, the Republic of China, and the present.\n\n\n=== Imperial period ===\n\n\n==== Inside the walled city ====\nCity Wall of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u57ce\u5899)\nGate of China (Zhonghuamen; \u4e2d\u534e\u95e8)\nFuzimiao (Confucius Temple) and Qinhuai River (\u5357\u4eac\u592b\u5b50\u5e99 \u79e6\u6dee\u6cb3)\nJiangnan Examination Hall (\u6c5f\u5357\u8d21\u9662)\nZhanyuan Garden (\u77bb\u56ed)\nOld Gate East (Laomendong) (\u8001\u95e8\u4e1c)\nTaoye Ferry (\u6843\u53f6\u6e21)\nMing Palace Site (\u660e\u6545\u5bab)\nXu Garden (\u7166\u56ed)\nJiming Temple (\u9e21\u9e23\u5bfa)\nBeiji Ge (\u5317\u6781\u9601)\nDrum Tower of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u9f13\u697c)\nChaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bab)\nStone City (\u77f3\u5934\u57ce)\nYuejiang Tower (\u9605\u6c5f\u697c)\nJinghai Temple (\u9759\u6d77\u5bfa)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Outside the walled city ====\nPurple Mountain Scenic Area (\u7d2b\u91d1\u5c71)\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum and its surrounding complex (\u660e\u5b5d\u9675)\nLinggu Temple (\u7075\u8c37\u5bfa)\nXuanwu Lake (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56)\nQixia Temple (\u6816\u971e\u5bfa)\nThe Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing (restored) (\u5927\u62a5\u6069\u5bfa\u7409\u7483\u5854)\nMochou Lake and Park (\u83ab\u6101\u6e56)\nYangshan Quarry (\u9633\u5c71\u7891\u6750)\nSouthern Tang Mausoleums (\u5357\u5510\u4e8c\u9675)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Republic of China period ===\nBecause it was designated as the national capital, many structures were built around that time.

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity. The YOG aims to spread the Olympic spirit and encourage sports participation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe city is renowned for its wide variety of architectures which mainly contain buildings from multiple dynasties, the Republic of China, and the present.\n\n\n=== Imperial period ===\n\n\n==== Inside the walled city ====\nCity Wall of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u57ce\u5899)\nGate of China (Zhonghuamen; \u4e2d\u534e\u95e8)\nFuzimiao (Confucius Temple) and Qinhuai River (\u5357\u4eac\u592b\u5b50\u5e99 \u79e6\u6dee\u6cb3)\nJiangnan Examination Hall (\u6c5f\u5357\u8d21\u9662)\nZhanyuan Garden (\u77bb\u56ed)\nOld Gate East (Laomendong) (\u8001\u95e8\u4e1c)\nTaoye Ferry (\u6843\u53f6\u6e21)\nMing Palace Site (\u660e\u6545\u5bab)\nXu Garden (\u7166\u56ed)\nJiming Temple (\u9e21\u9e23\u5bfa)\nBeiji Ge (\u5317\u6781\u9601)\nDrum Tower of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u9f13\u697c)\nChaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bab)\nStone City (\u77f3\u5934\u57ce)\nYuejiang Tower (\u9605\u6c5f\u697c)\nJinghai Temple (\u9759\u6d77\u5bfa)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Outside the walled city ====\nPurple Mountain Scenic Area (\u7d2b\u91d1\u5c71)\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum and its surrounding complex (\u660e\u5b5d\u9675)\nLinggu Temple (\u7075\u8c37\u5bfa)\nXuanwu Lake (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56)\nQixia Temple (\u6816\u971e\u5bfa)\nThe Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing (restored) (\u5927\u62a5\u6069\u5bfa\u7409\u7483\u5854)\nMochou Lake and Park (\u83ab\u6101\u6e56)\nYangshan Quarry (\u9633\u5c71\u7891\u6750)\nSouthern Tang Mausoleums (\u5357\u5510\u4e8c\u9675)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Republic of China period ===\nBecause it was designated as the national capital, many structures were built around that time.

          "Visited here on a Friday night, overall massively dissapointed strange atmosphere. We visited Mr Gao and sat for 45mins without being served eventually left not having had a drink. Most places are restaurant style ax opposed to bars. Won't be going again!!",
          "A good place to find everything you need from a Starbucks to night clubs. It isn't very appealing though, as it is more geared towards the local youth. Also a little expensive compared to the rest of nanjing. The bar called master Gao, a small one and a larger one further down,",
          "The whole 1912 Bar Street was a bit ill-managed from my perspective. It could be more interesting if the people on the street around that solicit for bars could have been regulated. They were okay but just a bit pushy. When we asked where was the Master Gao bar, perhaps Master",
          "Not too difficult to find this place. During the day, lots of restaurants and cafes you can visit. The landscape is pretty too.",
          "A good place to visit with your family and friends. Good food. Happy hour starts from 1430 - 2130. It's half rate for your liquor during this period. Be happy. Drink happy eat happy.",

          "1912 is a decent place to stroll for 30 minutes or so while you try and find Western food. They have a few places that are not open for lunch and tend to be a bar scene at night, which is fine if you are 25 and are out for a good time. Thaitasty restaurant has good Thai food",
          "Decent food and bars. Clean area but it's a bit small. Modern area, many laowais. Don't bother with Thai food there, it's Chinese food. Good little bars.",

          "Your typical western style street with international style restaurants, bars, cafes, cocktail lounges, clubs and brew pubs. Well worth a look down if you fancy visiting one of those places but in and of itself it\u2019s merely just a pedestrianised street of little interest.",
          "The 1912 area is an upmarket nightlife area in Nanjing. It is a nice little pedestrianised complex close to the city centre so is good for a wander in the evening. Most of the bars are very similar and slightly overpriced (lots of divey style places like Ellen\u2019s/Helen\u2019s except",

          "The normal stuff A lot of expats and a lot of bars and restaurants. Luckely it's not too big so you can walk in a normal way around do some restaurants, pubs and or some disco. In NANJING everybody knows it so getting there or erring back to the hotel is peace of cake.",

          "We were recommended to go here at night that the 1912 Area in Nanjing was supposedly the hot spot. I believe that is probably true for young Chinese people. So if you are a young Chinese person you may enjoy it. And Nanjing being a smaller tier city than Shanghai, this may be"

It is 448.2 m (1467 ft) high. Its peaks are often found enveloped in purple and golden clouds at dawn and dusk, hence its name.\nA small mountain with an area of about 20 square kilometers (4,900 acres), Purple Mountain is a mountain related to many historical events of both ancient and modern China. It was originally known as Bell Mountain (traditional Chinese: \u9418\u5c71; simplified Chinese: \u949f\u5c71; pinyin: Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n) and also became known as Mount Jiang (traditional Chinese: \u8523\u5c71; simplified Chinese: \u848b\u5c71; pinyin: Ji\u01cengsh\u0101n) after Sun Quan named Jiang Ziwen, an Eastern Han official whose spirit was said to haunt the site, as the mountain's god during the Three Kingdoms era. The name Zijin (\u7d2b\u91d1) means \"copper\" - when copper is pure, it appears purple in color, so in Chinese, it is also called purple-gold. It is also named Mount Jinling (\u91d1\u9675\u5c71), due to its purple rocks. Jinling means \"the mount of purple-gold\". It is the origin of the nickname \"Jinling\" (\u91d1\u9675) of Nanjing. During the Ming dynasty, it was also called Mount Shenlie (\u795e\u70c8\u5c71).\nMore than 200 heritage and scenic tourist sites are now located in or around the mountain, including three national historical sites, nine provincial historical sites, and 33 prefectural historical sites. Located in or close to the hillside of the mountain, there are also about a dozen national research institutes and universities. The Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the tomb of Sun Yat-sen, is located at the foot of the mountain.\nPurple Mountain has 621 species of vascular plants, from 383 genera, 118 families (including 78 cultivated species).\n\n\n== See also ==\nLinggu Temple\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum\nPurple Mountain Observatory\nSun Yat-sen Mausoleum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPurple-Gold Mountain Observatory the first and largest observatory of China, in Chinese\nLocation List of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, one UNESCO World Heritage Site\nZhongshan Journal",

          "One of the important landmarks of Nanjing . Be prepared to climb around 300 steps . It's worth it ! We got a clear day , so the view of the city of Nanjing was breathtaking . It also gives you the magnanimity of the development going on in this city of China .",
          "This park is easily accessible by metro from Nanjing. We got there late afternoon so didn't get to see everything. Go earlier in the day especially if you want to walk between the historic sites. They also limit number of people at a time so you might have to wait.",

          "We got dropped off at the wrong entrance but had planned on taking the cable cars up. Instead went to the mosuelum and hiked up to the top from there. It is not a hike for the weak hearted or non-exerciser. But we did it carrying a three year old. Took about two hours then then",
          "Coming down from this mountain was one of the hardest things we ever did. Let me explain. We decided to trek around, because the reviews warned us to be prepared for lots of walking. Nothing could prepare us for what we experienced. We wanted to take the cable car up to the",

          "Yes, I can agree with the goods and the bads of these other reviews. Like most all (if not all) Chinese parks, this place has paved trails everywhere so it's not as much a nature place as it could be. But, some of the walkways are absolutely gorgeous. Plenty of walking,",
          "Highly overrated, in short! We live in Shanghai so Nanjing features relentlessly as a \"must-do\" short getaway from this city. It is supposed to be steeped in history having been the capital of the Ming Dynasty as well as that of the Republic of China in modern times. However,",
          "Came here looking for a bit of respite from the crowds of the city, and while the area is generally quite beautiful I was greeted with pedestrian traffic jams just as bad as Xinjiekou. At every corner throngs and throngs of tourists. The purple mountain also has quite a",

          "History pur and beautiful maintained park. You can catch a good view from the tomb tower. We took the small path up the hill b hind the tower into the woods, very silent and nice there. Take at least 2h time to explore the whole park, it's worth it.",
          "Great travel experience, full of historic moments and interesting facts. The climb was pretty tough though-293 steps. Would recommend to people who like exploring but not to the elderly who have aching bodies.",

          "Choose a day with low pollution and once you get to the top, it'll be worth it for the view. There is a lot to do on the site, just walk around and explore!",
          "This is a great place to visit. It was a warm day, and I underestimated the number of stairs, but with a bottle of water, and my guide we got to the top. Very culturally significant place for the local people who had some enormous battles with enemies from the past. Make",

          "The mountain is big and full of many attractions. I did not hike up the mountain due to the unfavourable weather and was more interested in visiting the attractions instead. The mountain can be easily accessed via the subway- Muxuyuan (line2). The ticket counter could be found",
          "There are a series of spots and attractions in the Purple Mountain area and some shuttle buses to take you between locations as well. The most impressive spot is the Dr Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum. Climb the mountain along the stairs and the mausoleum is on the top. I went there",
          "Climb the mountain by foot, or by one of the electrical mini-buses for 10 RMB. The walk in this sub-tropical forest, lots of Bamboo trees, tiny water streams, and the Mausoleum at the top. You don't have to climb all the stairs to the top, but if you like parks and history, do",

          "The Purple Mountain area probably requires 4-6 hours depending on just how much you want to see. It has some lovely nature and architecture that should not be missed.",
          "Best place to visit, but you have to walk a lot to reach on the top. So have some drink with you for pleasant trip",
          "Great chance to exercise, like a stair-master on steroids. Beautiful setting however it lacks a lot in substance once you reach the summit. Not a special destination.",
          "In this place, you can visit lots of historical buildings, such as Sun Yat Sen mausoleum and Sun Yat Sen Museum and other buildings. It's worth to climb, even though too many people come and visit during holidays",

          "A super long cableway from the foot of the mountain to the top - 40 mins! Other than the mountain was over crowded by locals, it is almost covered in litter and trash - Chinese really have no relationship and any sense of preservation to their natural beauties",
          "Only 15 mins from Nanjing city this is an amazing place to visit. The park is beautiful and peaceful, there are no beggars or people harassing you and the historic value is worth the visit.",

          "I enjoyed walking around, reading about the grounds and discovering the mountain. I am not one to take a tour, a bus or taxi. I much prefer to see things at my own pace and I spent many hours on Zijin Shan. I am glad that I did and went back as I was not able to see it all in",
          "Great place to spend the whole day exploring. The Sun Yat sen Mausoleum tends to be really crowded, its better to start there early in the morning, and then move to the other sites which tend to have a fraction of the number of people",

        "wiki": "A temple of Confucius or Confucian temple is a temple for the veneration of Confucius and the sages and philosophers of Confucianism in Chinese folk religion and other East Asian religions. They were formerly the site of the administration of the imperial examination in China and Vietnam and often housed schools and other studying facilities.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe temples are known by a variety of names throughout East Asia. The two greatest temples in Qufu and Beijing are now known in Chinese as \"Temples of Confucius\" (K\u01d2ngmi\u00e0o, \u6587\u5edf). In some localities, they are known as \"Temples of Literature\" (\u6587\u5edf) (Chinese: w\u00e9nmi\u00e0o; Vietnamese: v\u0103n mi\u1ebfu; Korean: munmyo; Indonesian: boen bio) or \"Temples of the Sage of Literature\" (Vietnamese: v\u0103n th\u00e1nh mi\u1ebfu). In Southern China, however, temples by that name generally honor Wenchang Wang, a separate deity associated with the scholar Zhang Yazi. In Japan, they are usually known as \"Temples\" or \"Halls of the Sage\" (Japanese: seiby\u014d or seid\u014d, respectively).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe development of state temples devoted to the cult of Confucius was an outcome of his gradual canonisation. In 195 BC, Han Gao Zu, founder of the Han Dynasty (r. 206\u2013195 BC), offered a sacrifice to the spirit of Confucius at his tomb in Qufu. Sacrifices to the spirit of Confucius and that of Yan Hui, his most prominent disciple, began in the Imperial University (Biyong) as early as 241.\nIn 454, the Liu Song dynasty of southern China built a prominent state Confucian temple. In 489, the Northern Wei constructed a Confucian temple in the capital, the first outside of Qufu in the north. In 630, the Tang Dynasty decreed that schools in all provinces and counties should have a Confucian temple, as a result of which temples spread throughout China. Well-known Confucian shrines include the Confucian Temple in Jianshui, the Confucian Temple in Xi'an (now the Forest of Steles), the Fuzi Miao in Nanjing, and the Confucian Temple in Beijing, first built in 1302. The Confucian Temple of old Tianjin is located on Dongmennei Dajie, a short distance west of Traditional Culture Street (Gu Wenhua Jie). Occupying 32 acres of land, The Confucian Temple is the largest extant traditional architectural complex in Tianjin.\nThe largest and oldest Temple of Confucius is found in Confucius' hometown, present-day Qufu in Shandong Province. It was established in 479 BC, one year after Confucius's death, at the order of the Duke Ai of the State of Lu, who commanded that the Confucian residence should be used to worship and offer sacrifice to Confucius. The temple was expanded repeatedly over a period of more than 2,000 years until it became the huge complex currently standing. There is another temple in Quzhou.\nIn addition to Confucian temples associated with the state cult of Confucius, there were also ancestral temples belonging to the Kong lineage, buildings commemorating Confucius's deeds throughout China, and private temples within academies.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nBeginning in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), Confucian temples were built in prefectural and county schools throughout the empire, either to the front of or on one side of the school.  The front gate of the temple is called the Lingxing Gate (simplified Chinese: \u68c2\u661f\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u6b1e\u661f\u9580). Inside there are normally three courtyards, although sometimes there are only two. However, the complex in Qufu has nine courtyards containing scores of steles commemorating visits by an emperor or imperial grants of noble titles upon descendants of Confucius. The main building, situated in the inner courtyard with entry via the Dachengmen (simplified Chinese: \u5927\u6210\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u5927\u6210\u9580), is called the Dachengdian (Chinese: \u5927\u6210\u6bbf), variously translated as \"Hall of Great Achievement\", \"Hall of Great Completion\", or \"Hall of Great Perfection\". In imperial China, this hall housed the Spirit Tablets (Chinese: \u795e\u4f4d) of Confucius and those of other important sages (simplified Chinese: \u5723; traditional Chinese: \u8056) and worthies (simplified Chinese: \u8d24; traditional Chinese: \u8ce2). In front of the Dachengdian in Qufu is the Apricot Pavilion or Xingtan (simplified Chinese: \u674f\u575b; traditional Chinese: \u674f\u58c7). Another important building behind the main building is the Shrine of Adoring the Sage (Chongshengci simplified Chinese: \u5d07\u5723\u7960; traditional Chinese: \u5d07\u8056\u7960), which honoured the ancestors of Confucius and the fathers of the Four Correlates and Twelve Philosophers.\n\nUnlike Daoist or Buddhist temples, Confucian temples do not normally have images. In the early years of the temple in Qufu, it appears that the spirits of Confucius and his disciples were represented with wall paintings and clay or wooden statues. Official temples also contained images of Confucius himself. However, there was opposition to this practice, which was seen as imitative of Buddhist temples.  It was also argued that the point of the imperial temples was to honour Confucius's teachings, not the man himself.\nThe lack of unity in likenesses in statues of Confucius first led Emperor Taizu of the Ming dynasty to decree that all new Confucian temples should contain only spirit tablets and no images. In 1530, it was decided that all existing images of Confucius should be replaced with spirit tablets in imperial temples in the capital and other bureaucratic locations; nevertheless many modern Confucian temples do feature statues. Statues also remained in temples operated by Confucius's family descendants, such as that in Qufu.\n\n\n== Worship ==\nThe state cult of Confucius centred upon offering sacrifices to Confucius's spirit in the Confucian temple.\nA dance known as the Eight-Row Dance (\u516b\u4f7e\u821e), consisting of eight columns of eight dancers each, was also performed. Originally this was a Six-Row Dance, as performed for the lesser aristocracy, but in 1477 Confucius was allowed the imperial honour of the eight-row dance since he posthumously received the title of king.  Musicians who accompanied this dance played a form of music termed yayue.\nIn addition to worshipping Confucius, Confucian temples also honour the \"Four Correlates\", the \"Twelve Philosophers\", and other disciples and Confucian scholars through history. The composition and number of figures worshipped changed and grew through time. Since temples were a statement of Confucian orthodoxy, the issue of which Confucians to enshrine was a controversial one.\nBy the Republican period (20th century), there were a total of 162 figures worshipped. The Four Correlates are Yan Hui, Zeng Shen, Kong Ji (Zisi), and Mencius. The Twelve Philosophers are Min Sun (Ziqian), Ran Geng (Boniu), Ran Yong (Zhonggong), Zai Yu (Ziwo), Zi-gong, Ran You, Zi-Lu, Zi-You, Zi-Xia, Zi-Zhang, You Ruo, and Zhu Xi. A list of disciples of Confucius and their place in the Confucian temple can be found at Disciples of Confucius.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Outside mainland China ==\nWith the spread of Confucian learning throughout East Asia, Confucian temples were also built in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. Starting in the 18th century, some were even built in Europe and the Americas. At their height, there are estimated to have been over 3,000 Confucian temples in existence.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nThe bill allowing for the building of the very first Confucian Temple in Hong Kong, proposed by the Confucian Academy, passed in September 2013. The location of the temple was decided to be near the famous Taoist temple, Wong Tai Sin Temple, in Wong Tai Sin District.\n\n\n=== Taiwan ===\nThe first Confucian temple in Taiwan to be constructed was the Taiwan Confucian Temple, which was built during the period of Tungning Kingdom in 1665 in Tainan. A more recent one, the Taipei Confucius Temple, was built on Wenwu Street in Taipei in 1879, torn down by Japanese in 1907 to make place for the Taipei First Girls' High School, and re-erected on Dalong Street from 1925 to 1939. The new temple was designed by Wang Yi-Shun, who also oversaw its construction. The design is an example of typical Fujian temple style. Every year on September the 28th, the birthday of Confucius, city authorities hold the Shidian (Chinese: \u91cb\u5960) Ceremony here. In addition, there is a Confucian temple located in Zuoying District of Kaohsiung that was completed in 1974 in the Northern Song architectural style. Other Confucian Temples are found in Chiayi City, Taipei, Taichung and Changhua County.\n\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nA Confucian Temple in Vietnam is called V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu. The earliest recorded V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Vietnam is the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu, Hanoi, established in 1070 during the L\u00fd dynasty. After 1397, with the construction of schools throughout Vietnam under the Tran, Confucian temples began to spread throughout the country. Another renowned Vietnamese Confucian temple is the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu, H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean, located in H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean City. Well-known Confucian temples were built in Hu\u1ebf, Tam K\u1ef3, H\u1ed9i An, H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean, H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a, V\u0129nh Long and B\u1eafc Ninh.\n\n\n=== Korea ===\n\nOutside China, the largest number of Confucian temples is found in Korea. Temples were first built during the Goryeo period (918\u20131392). In the time of Yi Seonggye (r. 1392\u20131398), it was decreed that Confucian temples should be built in all areas of the nation. Although Chinese models were followed, variations in layout and construction were common, such as the building of schools in front of temples. Korea also added its own scholars (the eighteen scholars of the East) to the Confucian pantheon.\nHistorically, Korea had a total of 362 temples devoted to Confucianism. After World War II and the division of the country, those in the North were converted to other uses. However, many of the 232 temples in the South continued their activities (see Munmyo). In addition to temples devoted to Confucianism the Republic of Korea also has twelve Confucian family temples, two temples in private schools, and three libraries.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nConfucian temples (\u5b54\u5b50\u5edf, k\u014dshi-by\u014d) were also widely built in Japan, often in conjunction with Confucian schools. The most famous is the Yushima Seid\u014d, built in 1630 during the Edo period as a private school connected with the Neo-Confucianist scholar Hayashi Razan. Originally built in Shinobi-ga-oka in Ueno, it was moved at the end of the 18th century near present-day Ochanomizu by the Tokugawa Shogunate, and a major state-sponsored school, Shoheik\u014d, was opened on tis grounds..\nOther well-known Confucian temples are found in Nagasaki, Bizen, Okayama prefecture; Taku, Saga prefecture; and Naha, Okinawa prefecture.\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n\nConfucian temples are also found in Indonesia, where they are often known as \"Churches of Confucius\" as Confucianism is a recognised religion in that country. In Chinese, these establishments are known as litang (\u793c\u5802) or \"halls of worship\". The largest and oldest is the Boen Bio in Surabaya, originally built in the city's Chinatown in 1883 and moved to a new site in 1907. There are reportedly more than 100 Confucianist halls of worship throughout Indonesia.\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nThe first Confucian temple in Malaysia was built within a primary school known as Chung Hwa Confucian School (which has since split into SJK(C) Chung Hwa Confucian A, B and SMJK Chung Hwa Confucian) in Penang, in the early 20th century. The building of the school was initiated by the Qing dynasty ambassador to the British Straits Settlement at that time. In those days parents in Penang brought their children to this temple for prayer before they began their schooling. The children prayed for excellence in their studies.\nThere are also two Confucian schools in Kuala Lumpur, namely SMJK Confucian and Confucian Private School, and a Confucian school in Malacca where ceremonies in honour of Confucius are held annually.\n\n\n== List of temples ==\n\nTemple of Confucius in Qufu, China (Confucius's home town)\nTemple of Confucius in Beijing, China\nTemple of the Master in Nanjing, China\nTemple of Confucius in Shanghai, China\nTemple of Confucius in Suzhou, China\nTemple of Confucius in Jianshui, Yunnan, China (\u5efa\u6c34\u6587\u5e99)\nTemple of Confucius in Daixian, Shanxi, China\nTemple of Confucius in Taipei, Taiwan\nTemple of Confucius in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\nTemple of Confucius in Tainan, Taiwan (\"Taiwan Confucian Temple\")\nTemple of Confucius in Changhua, Taiwan\nTemple of Confucius in Nagasaki, Japan\nShiseiby\u014d, the Temple of Confucius in Naha, Okinawa, Japan\nSeiby\u014d, the Temple of Confucius in Taku, Japan\nYushima Seid\u014d, the Temple of Confucius in Tokyo, Japan\nMunmyo, the Temple of Confucius in Seoul, South Korea\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Hanoi, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in B\u1eafc Ninh, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Ngh\u1ec7 An, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in V\u0129nh Long, Vietnam\nBoen Bio in Surabaya, Indonesia\n\n\n== See also ==\nConfucian churches\nMansion and Cemetery of Confucius\nWenchang Wang\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nImages of the Temple of Culture, with detailed history of Confucian temples\nFull Virtual Walk & Info on Confucius Temple, Beijing\nAsian Historical Architecture: Fuzimiao in Nanjing\nAsian Historical Architecture: Confucian temple in Suzhou\nThe Confucian temple in Tainan\nSurabaya, with description of Boen Bio\nThe Taipei Confucius Temple",

          "The temple is worth a look if you haven't been to one before; take a quick stroll through the area, then move on. There's better things to see in Nanjing. In particular, I would advise against eating here. Just overpriced buffet restaurants and the so-called 'Gourmet Street'",
          "Off of a shopping street this is a quite place to look at the temple and exhibits. It takes at least thirty minutes but you could spend more time just meditating.",
          "A nice area, but a little bit to touristic in my taste. But if you like large crowds, enjoy some entertainments you should go there in the evening.",
          "I hate this place so much. There was trash and spit on the ground, and unfriendly locals shouting in their dialect. The food at Fuzimiao's restaurants was horribly terrible as well. I understand taste is a very subjective thing, but, well, the service provided was intolerably",
          "A commercialised network of street that was packed full of people on a Tuesday night. We came for the boat rides along the canals, aiming to float on over to Zhonghua Gate. The last of the boats on that route left at 18:00, which we missed. Instead, we took a different option",
          "Nice shopping area in historical surroundings. Day time at this time of the year can be extremely hot and the area comes to life around 6pm. The temple visit costs around 30rmb which is reasonable and can take up to a couple of hours most artefacts have English descriptions.",

          "In regards to the Confucius Temple, I have been to Qufu, the birthplace of Confucius, so I've had my fill with Confucius. I was very disappointed by the temple itself and the high ticket price. If you have been in China a long time and you've seen these kind of temples before,",

          "I'm not particularly into the temple as it truly is the heart of a heartless world by being so touristy but I love Fuximiao area. If you do like cheesy photo opportunities then head behind the temple to dress-up in traditional costumes for 20 RMB, I'd recommend starting at Aqua",

          "Fuzi Miao has been changed a lot since last time I was there. They did away with all the small vendors and moved them into new shops that match all the others. Kind of a Disneyified version of a market now. Kind of fake. But worth a visit to find something to bring home if you",

        "wiki": "The Yangshan Quarry (Chinese: \u9633\u5c71\u7891\u6750; pinyin: Y\u00e1ngsh\u0101n b\u0113i c\u00e1i; lit.: 'Yangshan Stele Material') is an ancient stone quarry near Nanjing, China. Used during many centuries as a source of stone for buildings and monuments of Nanjing, it is preserved as a historic site. The quarry is famous for the gigantic unfinished stele that was abandoned there during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. In scope and ambition, the stele project is compared to other public works projects of Yongle era, which included the launching of the treasure fleet for Zheng He's maritime expeditions and the construction of the Forbidden City in Beijing.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Yangshan Quarry is situated on the Yangshan Mountain (elevation 140 m),\nalso known as Yanmen Shan (\u96c1\u95e8\u5c71),\nnorthwest of Tangshan Town (\u6c64\u5c71\u9547).\nThe Yangshan is the main peak of the Kongshan Mountain Range (\u5b54\u5c71\u5c71\u8109). The site is located 15\u201320 km to the east from the eastern part of Nanjing City Wall and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Administratively, the area is in the Jiangning District of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Yangshan Quarry has been worked from the time of the Six Dynasties, the local limestone being used for construction of buildings, walls, and statues in and around Nanjing.After Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor) founded the Ming dynasty in 1368, the city of Nanjing became the capital city of his empire. The Yangshan quarry became the main source of stone for the major construction projects that changed the face of Nanjing.\nIn 1405, Hongwu's son, the Yongle Emperor, ordered the cutting of a giant stele in this quarry, for use in the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum of his deceased father. In accordance with the usual design of a Chinese memorial stele, three separate pieces were being cut: the rectangular stele base (pedestal), the stele body, and the stele head (crown, to be decorated with a dragon design). After most of the stone-cutting work had been done, the architects realized that moving stones that big from Yangshan to Ming Xiaoling, let alone installing them there in a proper way, would not be physically possible. As a result, the project was abandoned. In place of the stele, a much smaller tablet (still, the largest in the Nanjing area), known as the Shengong Shengde (\"Divine Merits and Godly Virtues\") Stele was installed in Ming Xiaoling's \"Square Pavilion\" (Sifangcheng)  in 1413.The three unfinished stele components remain in Yangshan Quarry to this day, only partially separated from the solid rock of the mountain. The present dimensions and the usual weight estimates of the steles are as follows:\n\nThe Stele Base (32\u00b004\u203203\u2033N 119\u00b000\u203200\u2033E), 30.35 m long, 13 m thick,  16 m tall, 16,250 metric tons.\nThe Stele Body (32\u00b004\u203207\u2033N 119\u00b000\u203202\u2033E), 49.4 m long (this would be the height, if the stele were to be properly installed), 10.7 m wide, 4.4 m thick,  8,799 tons.\nThe Stele Head (32\u00b004\u203206\u2033N 119\u00b000\u203202\u2033E), 10.7 m tall, 20.3 m wide, 8.4 m thick, 6,118 tons.According to experts, if the stele had been finished and put together, by installing the stele body vertically on the base, and topping with the stele head, then it would have stood 73 meters tall. For comparison, the Shengong Shengde Stele actually installed in Ming Xiaoling is 8.78 m tall (6.7 m body + crown, on top of a 2.8 m tall tortoise pedestal). The Song-dynasty (early 12th century) Wan Ren Chou (\"Ten Thousand Men's Sorrow\") Stele in Qufu, which is thought to be one of the tallest in China, is 16.95 m tall, 3.75 m wide, 1.14 m thick.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nAccording to a legend, workers who failed to produce the daily quota of crushed rock of at least 33 sheng would be executed on the spot. In memory of the workers who died on the construction site\u2014including those who died from overwork and disease\u2014a nearby village became known as Fentou (\u575f\u5934), or \"Grave Mound\". Ann Paludan translates the place name as \"Death's Head Valley\".In the centuries since the giant stele project was abandoned, a number of Ming, Qing, and modern authors visited the site and left accounts of it. The poet Yuan Mei (1716 \u2013 1797) expressed his feelings in \"The Song of Hongwu's Great Stone Tablet\" (\u6d2a\u6b66\u5927\u77f3\u7891\u6b4c), which concludes with \"one hundred thousand camels could not move it!\" (\"\u5341\u4e07\u9a86\u9a7c\u62c9\u4e0d\u8d77\"). The poem is published in his collection Xiao Cangshan Fang Wenji (\u5c0f\u4ed3\u5c71\u623f\u6587\u96c6).\n\n\n== Present day ==\n\nIn 1956, the Yangshan Quarry was entered on the Jiangsu provincial register of protected cultural monuments. It is maintained as a tourist site, although, according to journalists who visited it at the turn of the 21st century, the site was little known even in Nanjing itself, and had few visitors.A small theme park called the Ming Culture Village (\u660e\u6587\u5316\u6751, M\u00edng W\u00e9nhu\u00e0 C\u016bn) was constructed at the entrance to the site; as of 2011, it  has a stage, children's rides, and various history-themed amusements. A single admission ticket allows one to visit the \"village\" and then to walk some 300\u2013400 m to the quarry proper on one of several forest trails. The site is open year-round, but still is mostly deserted in winter.\nTransportation from Nanjing to the Yangshan Quarry (either directly to the Ming Culture Village's entrance plaza, or to the \"Yangshan Quarry\" stop on the Jiangsu Provincial Highway 122 (S122)) is provided by several bus routes, including the Nanjing-Tangshan Line (\u5357\u6c64\u7ebf,  N\u00e1n-T\u0101ng Xi\u00e0n) from the Nanjing Railway Station.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nYang, Xinhua (\u6768\u65b0\u534e); Lu, Haiming (\u5362\u6d77\u9e23) (2001), \u5357\u4eac\u660e\u6e05\u5efa\u7b51 (Ming and Qing architecture of Nanjing), \u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u793e (Nanjing University Press), ISBN 7-305-03669-2\nMa, Weiyuan (\u9a6c\u6e2d\u6e90) (2011), \u5927\u660e\u5e1d\u56fd\u4e4b\u6731\u68e3\u5377 (The Book of Ming Empire's Zhu Di), ISBN 978-7-5641-2865-4",

To consolidate his sovereignty and defend the city against coastal pirates, he adopted the suggestions of advisor Zhu Sheng to build a higher city wall, to collect grains and to postpone the coronation. The construction of the wall required the labor of 200,000 workers over twenty-one years to complete. Around 7 million cubic metres of earth were shifted. The City Wall of Nanjing was among the largest city walls ever constructed in China.  The enclosed Nanjing City is about 55 square kilometers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first Ming emperor was proclaimed in 1368 and a great deal of preparation was done prior to this to have an imperial city and all the imperial trappings ready. The name of the city was changed again to Yingtianfu (responding to heaven). A \"new city\" was built to the east of the old one to be used as a new palace or \"forbidden\" city. This city was laid out in much the same pattern as Beijing; indeed Nanjing\u2019s was the pattern for Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City.\n\nIn expanding the walls, it appears the Hongwu Emperor intended initially to simply add a bulge to the existing walls and encompass the New City to the east. The main north gate would have been the Drum Tower. However, it was decided to bring Lion Hill to the northwest into the city defences for strategic reasons, and this almost doubled the area the walls would encompass. In addition to the surviving walls of stone and brick, an outwall was built along the river and to the south as an additional defensive measure. Old maps show that there were close to twenty gates in this rammed earth wall. This outwall is long gone, but the names of the gates survive as local place names. Part of the wall on the south shore of Xuanwu Lake was built on the foundations of the old Stone City walls from the Six Dynasties period, and reused many of the bricks from that old wall.\n\nOriginally, thirteen gates were built through Nanjing\u2019s walls, but this number had grown to eighteen by the end of the Qing dynasty. Of the thirteen original gates, only Zhonghua Gate in the south, originally known as Jubao Gate, and Heping Gate in the north, originally called Shenci Gate, are still standing. Heping Gate is closed to the public as it is still used as an army barracks. Parts of other gates survive or have been partially reconstructed. The remains of a west gate, Hanzhongmen, originally called Shichengmen, stand in the middle of a plaza. These walls are part of the last of a series of three or four courtyards that made up the gate complex. During the Qing dynasty three more gates were added, including an entrance to Xuanwu Lake from the west built in 1910. Yijiang Gate on North Zhongshan Road was built in 1921, as was the major entrance to the city during Republican times when most visitors to the city arrived by boat at the docks just to the west.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nDifferent from ancient city walls in Beijing and Xi'an, its design and construction was unique and changed the old ways of equilibrium and symmetry. The construction concentrated on military defence because the city was at the foot of a mountain\u2014a natural barrier to control the commanding elevation with the river as its natural city moat. Because of this, the 60-square-kilometre Nanjing city became strategically located and difficult to reach.\nIgandon wall belonged to a military defensive system too. The difference was that it adopted a winding, free style, based on the city's complicated topography. Construction of the Beijing and the Xi'an city walls was in the ancient style of square or rectangular design. When it was built by the second son of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, the 12-kilometre long Xi'an city wall became the seat of local government. It could not match the scale of the capital Nanjing at that time.\n\n\n== Today ==\nToday the 600-year-old city wall of Nanjing still stands. Experts from Nanjing Cultural Relic Bureau say most of the foundations use granite, rectangle stones or limestone. The walls were packed layer by layer with broken bricks, gravel and yellow earth. All the brickwork joints were poured with mixed lime, water in which glutinous rice had been cooked, and tung oil because the coagulated mixture was very strong. That is why the city wall has stood for a long time. On top of the outer wall were 13,616 crenellations, or battlements, for defenders of the city to observe the enemy or dodge arrows. Opposite it was the parapet wall used as a balustrade to keep the defenders and horses safe. Standing on the wall, you will see tall ancient trees under your feet. Aside the top wall there are stone sluices to drain rain and near the wall's foundation there are further outlets. The ancient city wall was listed as a key cultural relic under state protection in 1988.\nIt was the longest city wall in the world and the city enclosed by it remained the world's largest until the 17th century.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNanjing City\nGate of China, Nanjing\nChinese city wall\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Old City Wall and Related Gate Buildings of Ming Dynasty in Nanjing\nInformation on specific gates and how to get to them",

        "wiki": "The Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders is a museum to memorialize those that were killed in the Nanjing Massacre by the Imperial Japanese Army in and around the then-capital of China, Nanjing, after it fell on December 13, 1937. It is located in the southwestern corner of  downtown Nanjing known as Jiangdongmen (\u6c5f\u4e1c\u95e8), near a site where thousands of bodies were buried, called a \"pit of ten thousand corpses\" (simplified Chinese: \u4e07\u4eba\u5751; traditional Chinese: \u842c\u4eba\u5751; pinyin: w\u00e0n r\u00e9n k\u0113ng).\n\n\n== Nanjing Massacre ==\n\nOn December 13, 1937, the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing (then spelt Nanking) \u2013 then the capital city of the Republic of China. During the first six to eight weeks of their occupation, the Japanese Army committed numerous atrocities, including rape, arson, looting, mass executions, and torture. China estimates that approximately three hundred thousand civilians and unarmed soldiers were brutally slaughtered.  This estimate was made from burial records and eyewitness accounts by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal and included in the verdict for Hisao Tani. Corpses littered the streets and were seen afloat in rivers for weeks, and many structures in the city were burned down. Countless shops, stores, and residences were looted and sacked.Japanese soldiers were also reported to have conducted killing competitions and bayonet practice using Chinese prisoners.  Approximately twenty thousand cases of rape occurred within the city during the first month of the occupation, according to the \"Judgement of the International Military Tribunal\". Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\n\n== Memorial Hall ==\nThe Nanjing Memorial Hall was built in 1985 by the Nanjing Municipal Government in memory of the three hundred thousand victims of the massacre. In 1995, it was enlarged and renovated. The memorial exhibits historical records and objects, and uses architecture, sculptures, and videos to illustrate what happened during the Nanjing Massacre. Many historical items were donated by Japanese members of a Japanese\u2013Chinese friendship group, which also donated a garden located on the museum grounds.\nIt occupies a total area of approximately twenty-eight thousand square meters, including about three thousand square meters of building floor space.\nThe memorial consists of three major parts: outdoor exhibits, sheltered skeletal remains of victims, and an exhibition hall of historical documents.\nAdmission is free. Visitors should prepare themselves for large crowds of people at all times of day. \n\n\n=== Outdoor exhibits ===\nThe outdoor exhibit include statues, sculptures, relief carvings, tablets, and a large wall listing the names of victims, as well as an atonement tablet and memorial walkway.  The memorial walkway displays footprints of survivors, some of which were impressed as recently as 2002.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Skeletal remains ===\n\nThe skeletal remains of massacre victims, now exhibited in a coffin-shaped display hall, were excavated from Jiangdongmen in 1985; 208 more were uncovered in 1998.\n\n\n=== Exhibition hall ===\nThe tomb-like exhibition hall, half underground, contains more than 1000 items related to the massacre, including an immense collection of pictures, objects, charts, and photographs. Paintings, sculptures, illuminated display cabinets, multimedia screens and documentary films serve to demonstrate to visitors the crimes committed by the Japanese military.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe memorial hall is accessible within walking distance west of Yunjinlu Station of Nanjing Metro. Take Line 2 to Yunjinlu Station. Use Exit 2. The entrance to the Memorial Hall is right across the street from the subway entrance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMemorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre (1937-1938)\nNanjing Massacre Memorial MuseumKirk A.

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly. In July 2019, Washington University School of Medicine announced a collaboration with Huici Health Management Co., and the Xiangcheng District, to open the new Huici Medical Center, which will include a 1,000-bed hospital for adult and pediatric patients. Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments. It is beside Jinji Lake, which lies to the east of the Suzhou Old City. On 26 February 1994, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew represented China and Singapore respectively in signing the Agreement to jointly develop Suzhou Industrial Park (originally called the Singapore Industrial Park). The project officially commenced on 12 May in the same year. SIP has a jurisdiction area of 288 km2 (111 sq mi), of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 (31 sq mi) with a planned residential population of 1.2 million.SIP is home to the Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District, an area of universities and higher education institutions, including Soochow University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Suzhou Industrial Park is also a popular residential district for many foreigners who work and live in Suzhou, as well as 'new Suzhou' residents who migrated to the area in search of work opportunities.\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone ====\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone was approved to be established by the government in April 2000, with a planning area of 2.9 km2 (1.1 sq mi). It is in Suzhou Industrial Park set up by China and Singapore. Inside the Export Processing Zone, all the infrastructures are of high standard.\n\n\n==== Suzhou New District ====\n\nThe Suzhou New District was established in 1990. In November 1992, the zone was approved to be the national-level hi-tech industrial zone. By the end of 2007, foreign-invested companies had a registered capital worth of US$13 billion, of which US$6.8 billion was paid in. SND hosts now more than 1,500 foreign companies. Some 40 Fortune 500 companies set up 67 projects in the district.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSuzhou Dongwu currently play in China League Two, the third division of Chinese football.

Suzhou railway station, near the city center, is among the busiest passenger stations in China. It is served by the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway (mostly \"conventional\" trains to points throughout China) and the Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach Shanghai railway station on the fastest G-series trains and less than 1 hour to Nanjing.\nThe Suzhou North railway station, a few kilometers to the north, is on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.\nOther stations on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as Kunshan. In and between Suzhou and Kunshan South railway station, Suzhou Industrial Park railway station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.\nThe northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang, presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-Yangtze railway from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway connects Suzhou with Shanghai, alternatively, there is the Yangtze Riverine Expressway and the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou Expressway. In 2005, the Suzhou Outer Ring was completed, linking the peripheral county-level cities of Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu. China National Highway 312 also passes through Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nSuzhou is served by three airports, Sunan Shuofang International Airport (co-owned by Wuxi and Suzhou), Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport ( one hour drive ), Shanghai Pudong International Airport ( two hours drive ).\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nPort of Suzhou, on the right bank of the Yangtze River, dealt with 428 million tons of cargo and 5.86 million TEU containers in 2012, which made it the busiest inland river port in the world by annual cargo tonnage and container volume.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Suzhou Rail Transit currently has four lines in operation and five other lines under construction. The masterplan consists of nine independent lines. Line 1 started operation on April 28, 2012, Line 2 started operation on December 28, 2013, and Line 4 started operation in 2017.

Fares are flat rated, usually 1 Yuan for a non-air-conditioned bus and 2 Yuan for an air-conditioned one. The Suzhou BRT, a 25-kilometre (16 mi) bus rapid transit system opened in 2008, operates 5 lines using elevated busways and bus-only lanes throughout the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOpera: Kunqu originates in the Suzhou region, as does the much later Suzhou Opera. Ballad-singing, or Suzhou pingtan, is a local form of storytelling that mixes singing (accompanied by the pipa and sanxian) with portions in spoken dialect.\nSilk: throughout China's Imperial past, Suzhou silk has been associated with high-quality silk products, supplying silks to ancient royal families. By the 13th century, Suzhou was already the center of the profitable silk trade.\nSong brocade: Suzhou's Song brocade, with its flashy colors, exquisite patterns, strong and soft texture, is one of China's three famous brocades, together with Nanjing Yun brocade and Sichuan Shu brocade. Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved. Whenever people talked about brocade, they mentioned the Song Dynasty, and thus Song brocade got its name and has been well-known ever since.\nHandicrafts: Suzhou embroidery, fans, Chinese musical instruments, scroll mounting, lanterns, mahogany furniture, jade carving, silk tapestry, traditional painting pigments of Jiangenxutang Studio, the New Year's wood-block prints of Taohuawu Studio.\nPaintings\nCalligraphic art\nCuisine: Yangcheng Lake large crab\nSuzhou Silk Hand Embroidery Art\nSuzhou is the original place of \"Jasmine\", a song sung by Chinese singers or actresses thousands of times on the occasions of almost every important meetings or celebrations.

        "wiki": "Yangzhou, postal romanization Yangchow, is a prefecture-level city in central Jiangsu Province, China. Sitting on the north bank of the Yangtze, it borders the provincial capital Nanjing to the southwest, Huai'an to the north, Yancheng to the northeast, Taizhou to the east, and Zhenjiang across the river to the south. Its population was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to 2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.\nHistorically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (lit. \"Rising Prefecture\") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient Yangzhou prefecture in imperial China. Yangzhou was one of the first cities to benefit from one of the earliest world bank loans in China, used to construct Yangzhou thermal power station in 1994.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nCurrently, the prefecture-level city of Yangzhou administers six county-level divisions, including three districts, two county-level cities and one county. Accordingly, they are further divided into 98 township-level divisions, including 87 towns and townships, and 11 subdistricts.\n\n\n== History ==\nGuangling (Chinese: \u5ee3\u9675; pinyin: Gu\u01cengl\u00edng; Wade\u2013Giles: Kuang-Ling), the first settlement in the Yangzhou area, was founded in the Spring and Autumn period. After the defeat of Yue by King Fuchai of Wu, a garrison city was built 12 m (39 ft) above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c. 485 BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three li square was named Hancheng. The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect Suzhou from naval invasion from Qi. During the Han dynasty, Guangling was the seat of Guangling Commandery. It constituted a part of the Xu Province, rather than the Yang Province (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established Yang Prefecture, and began to be referred to with its current name.\nUnder Emperor Yang of Sui (r. 604\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the Grand Canal until the fall of the Sui dynasty. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\n\n\n=== Tang Dynasty ===\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). Many Arab and Persian merchants lived in the city in the 7th century, but they were massacred in the thousands in 760 during the An Lushan Rebellion by Tian Shengong's (Chinese: \u7530\u795e\u529f; pinyin: Ti\u00e1n Sh\u00e9ng\u014dng; Wade\u2013Giles: T'ien Shen-kung) rebel insurgents during the Yangzhou massacre (760).During the Tang dynasty, many merchants from Silla also lived in Yangzhou.\nThe city, still known as Guangling, was briefly made the capital of Wu during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.\n\n\n=== From Song to Ming ===\nYangzhou was briefly the temporary seat of the Song dynasty government between 1128 and 1129, when most of North China had been conquered by the Jurchens during the Jin\u2013Song Wars. The Song had retreated south to the city from their original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchen in the Jingkang Incident of 1127.\nFrom Yangzhou, the Song moved to Hangzhou in 1129, later establishing it as the capital of the Southern Song.In 1280, Yangzhou was the site of a massive gunpowder explosion when the bomb store of the Weiyang arsenal accidentally caught fire. This blast killed over a hundred guards, hurled debris from buildings into the air that landed ten li away from the site of the explosion, and could be felt 100 li away as tiles on roofs shook (refer to gunpowder article).\nMarco Polo claimed to have served the Yuan dynasty in Yangzhou under Kubilai Khan in the period around 1282\u20131287 (to 1285, according to Perkins). Although some versions of Polo's memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry, if indeed he was employed there at all. Chinese texts offer no supporting evidence for his claim. The discovery of the 1342 tomb of Katarina Vilioni, member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of a thriving Italian community in the city in the 14th century. Moreover, both in The Travels of Marco Polo and in the History of Yuan there is documentation about a Nestorian Christian, who funded two churches in China during the three years he served as an official of the emperor: this functionary is named \"Mar Sarchis\" by Marco Polo and \"Ma Xuelijisi\" in the History of Yuan. He served as a supervisor in the province of Zhenjiang, a region neighboring Yangzou. In fact, it is well-documented that Kublai Khan trusted foreigners more than Chinese subjects in internal affairs.There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th and 14th centuries, indicating the presence of a Muslim community.During the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) until the 19th century Yangzhou acted as a major trade exchange center for salt (a government regulated commodity), rice, and silk. The Ming were largely responsible for building the city as it now stands and surrounding it with 9 km (5.6 mi) of walls.\n\n\n=== Early Qing ===\n\nAfter the fall of Beijing and northern China to the Manchus in 1644, Yangzhou remained under the control of the short-lived Southern Ming based in Nanjing. Qing forces led by Prince Dodo reached Yangzhou in the spring of 1645, and despite the heroic efforts of its chief defender, Shi Kefa, the city fell on May 20, 1645, after a brief siege. The ten-day Yangzhou massacre followed, Wang alleged that the number of victims was allegedly close to 800,000, that number is now disproven and considered by modern historians and researchers to be a ridiculous exaggeration. Shi Kefa himself was killed by the Manchus when he refused to switch his allegiance to the Qing regime.The city's rapid recovery from these events and its great prosperity through the early and middle years of the Qing dynasty were due to its role as administrative center of the Lianghuai sector of the government salt monopoly. As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy Johan Nieuhof described the city (Jamcefu, i.e. Yangzhou-Fu, in his transcription) commented on the city's salt trade as follows:\nThis Trade alone has so very much enrich'd the Inhabitants of this Town, that they have re-built their City since the last destruction by the Tartars, erecting it in as great splendor as it was at first.\nFamed at that time and since for literature, art, and the gardens of its merchant families, many of which were visited by the Kangxi and Qianling emperors during their Southern Tours, the Qing-era Yangzhou has been the focus of intensive research by historians.\n\n\n=== Late Qing and Republican era ===\nThe Yangzhou riot in 1868 was a pivotal moment of Anglo-Chinese relations during late Qing China that almost led to war. The crisis was fomented by the scholar-officials of the city, who opposed the presence of foreign Christian missionaries there. The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British China Inland Mission in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by Hudson Taylor. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in Shanghai, Sir Walter Henry Medhurst took seventy Royal Marines in a man-of-war and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from Viceroy Zeng Guofan and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\nFrom the time of the Taiping Rebellion (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.Among early plans for railways in the late Qing was one for a line that would connect Yangzhou to the north but this was jettisoned in favour of an alternative route. The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the Jing-Hang Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the Baoshe River, Datong River, Beichengzi River, Tongyang Canal, Xintongyang Canal, Baima Lake, Baoying Lake, Gaoyou Lake and Shaobo Lake.\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \"city proper\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the Slender West Lake; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the Lotus Flower Pond (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal. It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\nThe mean annual temperature is 15.72 \u00b0C (60.3 \u00b0F) annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from 2.5 \u00b0C (36.5 \u00b0F) in January to 28.0 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F) in July.\nThe annual average precipitation is 1,043 mm (41.1 in), and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer. The rainy season known as \"plum rain season\" usually lasts from mid-June to late July. During this season, the plums are ripening, hence the name plum rain.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nYangzhou has one Yangtze River crossing, the Runyang Yangtze River Bridge complex, which has one of the one of the longest suspension bridge spans in the world, and carries the G4011 Yangzhou\u2013Liyang Expressway to Zhenjiang.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe Yangzhou Taizhou International Airport, completed in 2012 to serve Yangzhou and neighbouring Taizhou, is located in Jiangdu district.  The Nanjing Lukou International Airport is over 100 km (62 mi) away; it takes one hour and 40 minutes to get there from central Yangzhou. Prior to the completion of the Yangzhou Taizhou Airport, Lukou Airport in Nanjing was the primary air gateway for passengers destined for Yangzhou. There are over 10 airline ticket offices in Yangzhou, providing convenient service for foreign and domestic tourists. domestic and international fight are available with 10 international airlines and more than 20 domestic ones\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nUntil 2004, Yangzhou was not served by passenger rail. Yangzhou Railway Station began construction in 2003 and was completed a year later. It is located on the western outskirts of the city, and is a major station on the Nanjing\u2013Qidong Railway, and provides direct passenger service to the provincial capital as well as a number of major cities to the west, north, and south (such as Xi'an, Wuhan, and Guangzhou), including an overnight Z-series express train to Beijing. Later, frequent high-speed (D-series) service has been introduced on this line as well.\nThere is no direct rail service between Yangzhou and Shanghai, however; to travel to Shanghai, or elsewhere in the Yangtze Delta regions, travelers cross the Yangtze over the new Runyang Bridge to Zhenjiang (frequent commuter bus service is available) and take a train from the Zhenjiang Railway Station, which is located on the main Nanjing-Shanghai rail line.\nIn 2016, construction work started on a new north-south rail line, the Lianyungan-Huai'an-Yangzhou-Zhenjiang Railway. The new Yangzhou station will be located on the east side on the city, between Yangzhou main urban area and Jiangdu District, 16.5 km (10.3 mi) east of the existing Yangzhou Railway Station. The new rail line is expected to open in 2020, while the new train station will gradually become the ciy's transportation hub, and its surrounding area, Yangzhou's new central business district.\n\n\n=== River transport ===\nYangzhou harbour, 11.5 km (7.1 mi) south from the city center, is located at the junction of the Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Canal and the Yangtze River. The average water depth is 15\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive inland harbor, integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern Anhui Province and southeast Shandong Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Huangshi and Wuhan in the west, and Nantong and Shanghai in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbour has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nThe Ningyang (Nanjing\u2013Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou's metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing\u2013Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly 18 km (11 mi), the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang\u2013Sanya and Beijing\u2013Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals 112.04 km (69.62 mi)in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.\n\n\n=== Intercity bus service ===\nDuring the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from Nanjing (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the Zhenjiang Railway Station) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.\n\n\n=== Transportation in the Urban Area ===\nThe city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.\nYangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.\nIn 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east-west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to Jiangdu District. Line 2 will run in the general north-south direction.\n\n\n=== Tourist Transportation ===\nTo develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda and Shita Temple. Yangzhou Public Transit also operates No.1, No.5 and No.2 special tourist lines. No.1 bus departs from the bus station and goes by the Slender West Lake, Shigong Temple, Geyuan Garden and Heyuan Garden; No.5 bus starts from the bus station and goes by the Crane Temple, Wenchang Pagoda, Slender West Lake, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and Pingshan Hall. A sight-seeing route on Slender West Lake has opened, connecting Imperial Dock, Yichun Garden, Hong Garden, Dahong Bridge, Xiaojinshan, Diaoyutai, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and the 24-bridge, finally reaching Daming Temple and Pingshan Hall.\n\n\n== Industries and Shipyards ==\nYangzhhou is the site of Chengxi shipyard, large shipyard where bulk carriers and other types of large ships are built. Owned partly by the state owned CSSC holdings, through Jiangsu Xinrong shipyard, Chengxi Yangzhou shipyard builds ships from 25,000 dwt to 170,000 dwt in size.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nYangzhou dishes may be one of the reasons why the people of Yangzhou are so infatuated with their city. They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh flavour of the food.\nIn Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with dazhu gansi (Chinese: \u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d; pinyin: d\u00e0zh\u01d4 g\u0101ns\u012b), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\n\nFu Chun Teahouse\nYangzhou fried rice, is said to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou magistrate.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Yangzhou dialect (Chinese: \u626c\u5dde\u8bdd; pinyin: Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du hu\u00e0) of Chinese is representative of Lower Yangtze Mandarin, and is particularly close to the official language of the Ming and Qing courts, which was based on the Nanjing dialect. However, it does differ considerably from modern Standard Chinese, although they are still moderately mutually intelligible.\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the Jiangbei and Jiangnan regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \"backwater\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided to replace Jianghuai Mandarin, which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with Taihu Wu dialects. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.During a period of prosperity and Imperial favour, the arts of storytelling and painting flourished in Yangzhou. The innovative painter-calligrapher Shitao lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou are famous throughout China.\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China Jiang Zemin was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\nYangzhou is famous for its carved lacquerware and jade.\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called Huaiyang (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, and Shandong cuisine, Huaiyang cuisine (\u6dee\u626c\u83dc) is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.\nThe city is famous for its public bath houses, lacquerware, jadeware, embroidery, paper-cut, art & crafts velvet flavers.\nThe city was awarded Habitat Scroll of Honour in 2006.\nYangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling (\u626c\u5dde\u8bc4\u8bdd), which is like Xiangsheng\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the Ming Dynasty. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was Wang shaotang. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of Wu Song (\u6b66\u5341\u56de), The 10 chapters of Song Jiang (\u5b8b\u5341\u56de), The 10 chapters of Lu Junyi (\u5362\u5341\u56de), and The 10 chapters of Shi Xiu (\u77f3\u5341\u56de).\n\n\n=== Literary references ===\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.  Poet Li Bai (c.700\u2013762) wrote in Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion:\n\nAt Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west\nMy old friend says farewell;\nIn the mist and flowers of spring\nHe goes down to Yangzhou;\nLonely sail, distant shadow,\nVanish in blue emptiness;\nAll I see is the great river\nFlowing into the far horizon.Du Mu wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:\nAfter ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,\nAll I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.The \"green mansions\" or \"green/black lofts\" (qinglou) refers to the pleasure districts for which Yangzhou became known.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourist sights include Slender West Lake and old residences in the moated town, such as the Wang Residence and the Daming temple. Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens.  Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.\n\n\n=== Slender West Lake ===\n\nNamed after Hangzhou's famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Daming Temple ===\n\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song Dynasty (420\u2013479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the Jianzhen Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall ===\nBuilt by the Song Dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu's student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.\n\n\n=== Pavilion of Flourishing Culture (\u6587\u660c\u9601, W\u00e9nch\u0101ng G\u00e9) ===\n\nThis round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou's eastern sector was built in 1585 and celebrates the city's rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.\nBuilt during Ming dynasty, it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79-foot high, and looks like Temple of Heaven in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.\n\n\n=== Stone Pagoda ===\nStanding west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture is a five-story Tang Dynasty pagoda (Chinese: \u77f3\u5854; pinyin: Sh\u00edt\u01ce). Built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.\n\n\n=== Tomb of Puhaddin ===\n\nThis is essentially a Ming Dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of Puhaddin. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of Muhammad, The Prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.\n\n\n=== Ge Garden (\u4e2a\u5712, G\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n) ===\nThe entrance to this typical southern style garden with its luxuriant bamboo groves, ponds, and rock grottoes is on Dongguan St. in the city's northeast section. Designed by the great Qing Dynasty landscape painter Shi Tao for Wang Yingtai, an officer of the Qing imperial court, this garden takes its name from the shape of bamboo leaves which resemble the Chinese character ge, meaning \"a\" or \"an.\"\n\n\n=== He Garden (\u4f55\u56ed, H\u00e9 Yu\u00e1n) ===\nThis garden, also called Jixiao Shan Zhuang, was built by He Zhidao, a 19th-century Qing government official, this garden home is famous for a 430 m (1,410 ft), two storied winding corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry, In the garden is also an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.\n\n\n=== Yechun Garden (Yechun Yuan) ===\nIn this garden, which lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city's northern limits, the Qing Dynasty poet Wang Yuyang and a circle of friends used to gather to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint, rustic air.\n\n\n=== Yangzhou Museum & Yangzhou Block Printing Museum ===\n\nSituated on the west side of the Bright Moon Lake, the Yangzhou Chinese Block Printing Museum (\u626c\u5dde\u4e2d\u56fd\u96d5\u7248\u5370\u5237\u535a\u7269\u9986) and Yangzhou Museum (\u626c\u5dde\u535a\u7269\u9986) look into the distance of Yangzhou International Exhibition Centre and covers an area of 50,000 square meters, with a construction space of 25,000 square meters, and an exhibition area of 10,000 square metres. Its unique architectural form embodies the harmony of man nature, structure and natural environment. In August, 2003, over 300,000 ancient books blockings were collected from Guangling Press of Yangzhou and China Block Printing Museum was established under the approval of the State Council, over 300,000 ancient book blockings collected by Guangling Press of Yangzhou were included in the new museum.\n\n\n=== Jiangdu Hydro Project ===\nConstruction of this multiple-purpose water control project, the biggest in China, started in 1961 and was completed in 1975. The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation. It consists of four large modern electric pumping stations, six medium-sized check gates, thrice navigation locks, and two trunk waterways.\n\n\n== Education ==\nYangzhou University\nSima Primary School\nYangzhou Polytechnic College\nYangzhou Polytechnic Institute\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n\n Balashikha, Moscow Oblast, Russia\n Kent, Washington, US\n Malacca City, Malaysia\n Neubrandenburg, Germany\n Offenbach am Main, Germany (since 1997)\n Orl\u00e9ans, France\n Porirua, New Zealand\n Vaughan, Ontario, Canada\n Westport, Connecticut, US\n\n\n== See also ==\nIranians in China\n\n\n== References ==\nAustin, Alvyn (2007).

        "wiki": "Nanjing University (NJU or NU, sometimes Nanking University, simplified Chinese: \u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b66; traditional Chinese: \u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78; pinyin: N\u00e1nj\u012bng D\u00e0xu\u00e9, N\u00e1nk\u012bng T\u00e0hs\u00fc\u00e9h), known as Nanda (\u5357\u5927; N\u00e1nd\u00e0), is a major public university, the oldest institution of higher learning in Nanjing, Jiangsu, and a member of the elite C9 League of Chinese universities.\nEstablished in 1902 as Sanjiang Normal School, it underwent a number of name changes until it was renamed Nanjing University in 1950. It merged with the University of Nanking in 1952.In addition to its membership in the C9 League, Nanjing University has been designated a Class A institution in the Double First Class University plan, a government initiative to cultivate an elite group of Chinese universities into \"world-class\" institutions. The university is perennially ranked one of the best research universities in China, and one of China's most selective universities. It is ranked among the top universities worldwide in major global university rankings. Regarding research output, the Nature Index 2017 ranks Nanjing University number 2 in China, number 3 in Asia Pacific and number 12 in the world.NJU has two main campuses: the Xianlin campus in the northeast of Nanjing, and the Gulou campus in the city center of Nanjing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nNanjing, situated in the lower part of the Yangtze, has historically been the capital of various kingdoms and dynasties, with the reputation as the center of education. In 258 CE, the Kingdom of Wu under the reign of Emperor Jing of Wu, founded a Confucian learning institute for the purpose of learning Six Arts. In the first year of Jianwu reign (317), Taihsueh (\u592a\u5b78) campus was built in today's Fuzimiao (\u592b\u5b50\u5edf) area on the banks of Qinhuai River, and Nanking Imperial University began recruiting students from common families instead of only from noble families. Like its forerunner Chengjun (\u6210\u5747) and succeeding Shang Hsiang (\u4e0a\u5ea0) founded by Yu (\u79b9, 21st century BCE) in Chungyuan, the earliest recorded imperial higher learning institutions and their successors, it was the Kingdom's central university, which after Han dynasty excellent students from local schools could be selected to attend to pursue further education.\nIn 470 during the Former Song dynasty, the Imperial Central University (Zongmingguan) became a comprehensive institution combining higher education and research, with five divisions: Literature, History, Confucian Study, Xuan Study and Yin Yang Study. The campus of School of Literature and School of History were located in today's Nanjing University Gulou campus, west to Gulou (\u9f13\u6a13) mountain, and the campus was moved to today's Chaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bae) area at the time when Wang Jian (\u738b\u5109) was university president and the areas of study were narrowed, with a heavy focus on Confucian classics. In the period the faculty members included such scholars and scientists as Zu Chongzhi (\u7956\u6c96\u4e4b), Ge Hong (\u845b\u6d2a), Wang Xizhi (\u738b\u7fb2\u4e4b), and students included such figures as Xiao Daocheng, Emperor Gao of Southern Qi who studied at School of Confucian Studies, and Zhong Rong, a founding scholar of poetics who graduated from division of literature. After the fall of Chen dynasty, the school was closed and later replaced by Nanking Academy (or Jiangzhou Academy, Jiangzhou Zhouxue) in Sui dynasty.\nIn 937 when campus of the imperial national university was again in Fuzimiao area, Li Shandao, a scholar of the university, established another national school Lushan National Academy outside the capital city Nanking which is called Bailudong Shuyuan (White Deer Grotto Academy), a famous academy that hosted many renowned scholars including Zhu Xi, Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming.\nIn 1382 the Imperial University (\u570b\u5b50\u76e3 Kuotzuchien or Guozijian) moved campus from Nanking Fuzimiao area to south of Qintian Mountain (\u6b3d\u5929\u5c71) and Xuanwu Lake (the area around Nanjing University campus before 1952. In 1952 Nanjing University moved to Gulou and its engineering school was split and formed several independent colleges including Nanjing Institute of Technology, which at its peak spanning 10 Li and hosting near 10,000 students, and around there were institutes including Qintian Jian (Imperial Astronomy Institute) and Taiyi Yuan (Imperial Medical Institute). In 1403 Peking Guozijian (Beijing Guozijian, Imperial University of Peking) was established. The Imperial University of Nanking (\u5357\u4eac\u570b\u5b50\u76e3) developed and flourished in the period, consisting of six schools: three basic level colleges (Chengyi, ChongChih, Guangye), two middle level schools (Hsiudao, Chenghsin) and one advanced level school (Shuaihsing), altogether 4 years to complete according to the system, one and a half years for both of the former two levels and one year for the latter level, to achieve 8 credit points a year and then upon graduation Chushen (qualification, diploma) would be awarded, with subjects including Confucian classics, history, literature, mathematics, law, calligraphy, equestrianism and archery, etc. Yongle Encyclopedia was completed at Imperial Nanking University in 1408 after five years compilation, 9169 scholars selected from nationwide took part in it, thereinto 2180 were student scholars of the university. The publishing house of the imperial university of Nanking had been a publishing centre for several hundred years. Wu Cheng'en, Tang Hsiantzu and Zheng Chenggong studied there during the Ming dynasty.\nEach time when Nanking became a non-capital city, the Nanking Imperial University was changed to be regional Nanking Academy. The Imperial Nanking University was changed to Nanking Academy (\u6c5f\u5be7\u5e9c\u5b78, Jiangning Fuxue) in 1650 after Qing dynasty replaced Ming dynasty, and in 1865 after Taiping Rebellion the academy was relocated to Chaotian Palace. The ancient school history was recognized during ROC. In 1954 the school authority controlled by CPC decided to set the year starting to establish the modern new type school Sanjiang Normal College as the school's new founding year.\n\n\n=== Late Qing and Republic of China ===\n\nIn 1902, Sanjiang Normal College (\u4e09\u6c5f\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u5802) under the new educational system, using Japanese modern higher institutions of learning as references, was beginning to be established to replace the traditional Chinese school Nanking Academy, and was opened in the next year, with campus constructed south to Qintian Mountain. The name was changed to Liangjiang Normal College (\u5169\u6c5f\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u5802) in 1906, and the new president Li Ruiqing (\u674e\u745e\u6e05) established the first faculty of modern art in China.\nIn 1915 after the Republic of China replaced Qing dynasty, the Nanking Higher Normal School (\u5357\u4eac\u9ad8\u7b49\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u6821) was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed three years before due to Xinhai Revolution, Jiang Qian (\u6c5f\u8b19) was appointed as the president. The school established the China's first faculty of modern gymnastics (physical education) in 1916. In 1920 the school consisted of five colleges: Liberal Arts, Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce and Education.\nThe \"China Science Society\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u793e), a major science organization in the modern history of China, founded its headquarter in the school in 1918. Its members established \"Academia Sinica\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u7814\u7a76\u9662) which was later moved to Taiwan and known as the \"Chinese Academy of Sciences\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u9662) in mainland China. Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in America and some European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China. It became the Chinese cradle of modern science. Among 81 academicians of \"Academia Sinica\" elected for the first time in 1948, five entered or graduated from the university in 1920. More than half of the leading Chinese scientists whose works were published in scientific journals in the early period of Chinese modern science were graduates or academics of Nanjing University.\nKuo Ping-wen (Guo Bingwen, \u90ed\u79c9\u6587), an influential university president, was appointed in 1919 after Jiang Qian. The school meeting passed The Audit Law for Women Students (\u300a\u898f\u5b9a\u5973\u5b50\u65c1\u807d\u6cd5\u6848\u300b) on December 7, 1919, as result of efforts of the educationist T'ao Hsing-chih (Tao Xingzhi, \u9676\u884c\u77e5), as well as the president Guo Bingwen, and the professors including Liu Boming (\u5289\u4f2f\u660e), Luh Chih-wei (Lu Zhiwei, \u9678\u5fd7\u5049), Yang Hsingfo (Yang Xingfo, \u694a\u674f\u4f5b), etc., and then decided to formally recruit female students. The school became the first higher learning institution in China to recruit coeducational students. It enrolled eight women students in the first year 1920, and in addition, more than 50 female auditing students were admitted.\nIn 1921 the National Southeastern University (\u570b\u7acb\u6771\u5357\u5927\u5b78) was founded, and in 1923 Nanking Higher Normal School was merged into it. In the autumn of 1921, the Faculty of Business established in 1917 was moved to Shanghai to establish the first business school conferring degrees in China. The university consisted of five colleges (or schools) at the time: Liberal Arts (including departments of Chinese literature, foreign literature, history, philosophy, psychology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geoscience, and the Department of Politics, Law and Economics), Education, Agriculture, Engineering, and Commerce (or Business, including departments of general commerce, business administration, accounting, finance, economics, international trade, etc.), and soon later the College of Liberal Arts was divided to be College of Humanities and College of Sciences. The earliest modern scientific research laboratories and groups in China were established at the university. It integrated teaching and research, with status of university's independence and academic freedom, and was regarded as the earliest Chinese modern university. The university along with its affiliated primary school and middle school served as a pioneer and model which laid the foundations for the establishment of modern educational system (\u58ec\u620c\u5b78\u5236, Renhs\u00fc Hs\u00fcehchih, 1922) in China, and in addition, its experimental kindergarten (Gulou Kindergarten) founded in 1923 was later also adopted as the model for Chinese kindergartens (Kindergarten Courses Standards by Ministration of Education, 1932), including its teaching system, teaching materials, teaching methods and teaching tools. In October 1921, \"Hsuehheng Society\" (or Xueheng Society, \u5b78\u8861\u793e) was founded in the university which was the focus of the \"Hsuehheng School\" included the scholars Liu Yizheng (\u67f3\u8a52\u5fb5), Liu Boming (\u5289\u4f2f\u660e), Mei Guangdi (\u6885\u5149\u8fea), Wu Mi (\u5433\u5b93) and Hu Hsien-Hsu (Hu Xiansu, \u80e1\u5148\u9a4c). They reinvigorated Confucian culture and humanism and published the monthly \"Critical Review\" (Xueheng, \u5b78\u8861 in Chinese) in January 1922. It enabled Nanjing University to become a center of Confucian thought and humanistic scholarship. During this period, Nanjing University was known as the foremost \"Oriental Education Centre\" and recognized as an academic and cultural exchange centre for east and west. Many scholars visited and instructed there, including the American educationist Paul Monroe, W. H. Kilpatrick, E. L. Thorndike, philosopher John Dewey, British philosopher Bertrand Russell, German philosopher Hans Driesch and the Indian (also Bengali) poet Rabindranath Tagore.\nThe university became the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital by Nationalist Government, initially renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (or called National Nanking Chungshan University) in June 1927 when National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province, and was renamed Jiangsu University in February 1928, and in May 1928, it was renamed National Central University (\u570b\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u5b78). At the time there were eight colleges (or schools): Humanity, Social Science, Natural Science, Engineering, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, and Medicine. The College of Commerce moved to Shanghai in 1921 and College of Medicine established in Shanghai in 1927 were split from the university in 1932. In 1935 College of Medicine was again established, in Nanjing. During the Anti-Japanese War between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to Chongqing, while the College of Medicine and Department of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Medicine of College of Agriculture moved to Chengdu. The Chinese Association of Natural Science (\u4e2d\u83ef\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b78\u793e) was originated at the university in 1927 and adopted the name next year, which was the second largest scientific organization in China in 1949, after China Science Society. China Association of Scientific Workers (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5354\u6703) was founded in the university in 1944. China Science Society and the associations were merged to be the China Association for Science and Technology (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u6280\u8853\u5354\u6703) in 1958 in Beijing. The Natural Science Forum was initiated by the university faculties in 1939, which was later renamed Jiusan Forum (Sept. 3rd Forum) and became Jiusan Society in 1945, an organization for intellectual groups in China.  In the united college entrance examinations beginning in 1937, about two-thirds of students put the university as the first choice. It became the first Chinese university enrolling blind college student, when enrolled Luo Fuxin (\u7f85\u798f\u946b) in 1942.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nIn 1949, during the late time of Chinese Civil War, the central government of the Republic of China retreated from Nanking and the National Central University was renamed National Nanking University (National Nanjing University, \u570b\u7acb\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78) after Nanking was controlled by CPC army, before the establishment of People's Republic of China. In 1952, many colleges and departments, mainly colleges of education (or teacher, normal, including art and physical education departments), engineering, agriculture, and medicine, were split from Nanjing University, and many new independent schools were formed, including Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing Institute of Technology which was located at former Nanjing University site and later renamed Southeast University, etc. At the same time, University of Nanking (\u91d1\u9675\u5927\u5b78), a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into Nanjing University (\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78), which lost its \"national\" appellation in 1950 to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was west to Gulou Mountain and was also once the site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times. A separate National Central University was reinstated in Taiwan by its old alumni association in 1962.\n\nDuring the period of communist society including the period of Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the school suffered heavily. In 1976, Nanjing University faculty members and students launched Anti Cultural Revolution Force Movement which was called \"Nanjing Incident\" by the authorities of the time, spreading countrywide. In 1978, Hu Fuming, a faculty member of Nanjing University in philosophy, wrote the historic article entitled \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth\", and after being published it led to the nationwide \"Debate on Standards for Judging the Truth\", and thus in certain degree liberated thought and promoted the ending of Cultural Revolution and the coming of reform era.\n\n\n=== After the Reform and new development ===\nMany faculties have been reestablished or newly founded since the Reform after 1978, e.g., law reestablished in 1981, medical school in 1987, environmental department newly founded in 1984. Some departments were divided into two or more departments, e.g., the Chinese language and literature department divided into departments of language & linguistics, literature, philology and drama arts, or some new faculties came out of older faculties, e.g., computer came out of mathematics, urban planning came out of geography, in many case formed integratively, i.e., formed based on parts of two or more faculties, e.g., parts of faculties of physics and chemistry integratively formed material faculty. In around 1990 the university consisted of schools (colleges) of Humanities, Sciences, Technological Sciences, Medicine, Business, etc.. Then many departments became schools, e.g., mathematics, physics, chemistry, or grouped into new schools, e.g., architecture and urban planning. The size of university significantly expanded during the years.\nIn 2009, Xianlin Campus opened to undergraduates, replacing Pukou Campus which was in use since 1993, and Pukou Campus became the campus of NJU Jinling College, an independent private college directed by NJU. The Xianlin campus now is a main campus along with Gulou campus.\n\n\n== Faculties ==\n\nMore than 1500 years ago, ancient University of Nanjing founded the earliest faculties of literature, history, etc.. In modern times, Nanjing University established Chinese first faculties of art, gymnastics, biology, psychology, business management, etc.. Its faculties, departments and schools have been changed and evolved timely. For example, in 1921, the university consisted of 5 schools: liberal arts, education, agriculture, engineering and business, in 1928 the school of liberal arts had become three schools, and the university consisted of 8 schools: humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, agriculture, engineering, business and medicine, and now, many former departments of humanities, natural sciences and social sciences have become schools.\nThe system of academic degree or diploma has also been changed. In the early years of ROC the university adopted the system similar to western especially American universities and began to award bachelor's degree. The university founded China's first modern laboratories in physics, chemistry, etc.. In 1922, the university professors founded The Biology Research Institute of Science Society of China, the first modern scientific research institute in China, integrated with the university's biology department. With the aid of Rockefeller Foundation, Science Centre was constructed in 1924 and completed three years later. In 1926 the university passed The General Regulation of Graduate Institute. China's first doctor's degree was awarded by the school of medicine of the university in 1931. Soon the educational system was changed. In the early 1980s after a period of transformation, universities in mainland China resumed to award doctor's degrees, and graduate and undergraduate education were integrated into departments and schools. Nanjing University is the first in mainland China to award doctor's degrees in such fields as Chinese studies, world history, computer science.\nIt is distinguished in many fields including Chinese Language and Literature, and natural sciences.\nIts faculty, including part-time faculty, includes more than twenty Nobel Laureates engaged in teaching.\nThe university is a Double First Class University Plan university in 15 academic disciplines.\n\n\n=== Schools and departments ===\n\nCurrent schools and departments\n\nSchool of Liberal Arts (School of Literature, or College of Literature)\nChinese Language and Linguistics; Literature; Philology; Drama Arts\nSchool of History\nChinese History; World History; Archaeology\nDepartment of Philosophy; Religion\nSchool of Foreign Studies\nEnglish; Russian; Japanese; French; German; Spanish; Korean; International Business\nSchool of Government\nPolitics; Government Administration; Labor, Personnel and Social Security; Diplomacy and International Affairs\nSchool of Law\nSchool of Social and Behavioral Sciences\nSociology; Social Work and Social Policy; Psychology; Anthropology (institute)\nSchool of Business (NUBS)\nSchool of Management: Business Administration; Human Resource; Accounting; Marketing & Electronic Commerce\nSchool of Economics: Economics; Industrial Economics; International Economics & Trading; Finance\nDepartment of Information Management\nSchool of Journalism and Communication\nDepartment of Mathematics\nSchool of Physics\nPhysics; Modern Physics; Photoelectricity Science; Acoustic Science and Engineering\nSchool of Astronomy and Space Science\nAstronomy; Space Science\nSchool of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\nChemistry; Chemical Engineering; Polymer\nSchool of Geoscience\nSchool of Atmosphere Science: Meteorology; Atmosphere Physics\nSchool of Earth Science and Engineering: Earth Science; Water Science; Geology Engineering and Information Technology\nSchool of Geography and Ocean Science: Natural Geography; Land, Resources and Tourism;  Earth Information Science; Coast and Ocean Science\nSchool of Life Sciences\nBiology; Biochemistry\nSchool of Medicine\nClinical Medicine; Dentistry; Basic Medical Science; Laboratory Medicine; Public Health and Medicine (institute)\nSchool of Environment\nSchool of Architecture and Planning\nArchitecture; Urban Planning and Design\nSchool of Electronics Science and Engineering\nElectronic Engineering; Micro-electronics and Optoelectronics; Informational Electronics; Communication Engineering\nDepartment of Computer Science and Technology; Software Institute\nCollege of Engineering and Applied Sciences\nMaterials; Energy; Quantum Electronics and Optical Engineering; Biomedical Engineering\nInstitute of Education (Graduate School of Education)\nInstitute for Gymnastics\nInstitute of Arts\nInstitute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Science\nSchool for Basic Sciences Education\nInternational School\nSchool for Overseas Students Education\nJinling College(First-class applied college)\nJohns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center)\nOther research and education institutes in areas such as African Studies, Judaic Studies, Agriculture, Engineering Management, etc.\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nNanjing University has three main campuses: Gulou, Xianlin and Pukou campus. The distance between Gulou and Xianlin campus is about 18 kilometers.\nGulou Campus is located in Gulou District, at the center of Nanjing City. The main campus itself is divided into two sections by Hankou Road: North Garden, Bei Yuan, is where teaching and research take place; and South Garden, Nan Yuan, serves as the living area for both students and academic staff.\nPukou Campus is situated in the suburban Pukou District, by the northern side of Nanjing New & High-Tech Industry Development Zone, and became part of Nanjing University in 1993. Once Pukou campus hosted undergraduate freshmen, sophomore and junior students. In 2009, the Pukou campus became the campus hosted the undergraduate students in Nanjing University Jinling College, which was founded by Nanjing University in 1998. Nanjing University Biomedical Research Institute is also located in Pukou.\nXianlin Campus is located in the northeast of Nanjing, in the Xianlin Universities Town, south of Yangtse River and Qixia Mountain, east of Purple Mountain, and west of Baohua Mountain. The campus is home to undergraduate students and parts of graduate students. It was opened in September 2009. There is the stop of Nanjing University Xianlin Campus on Line 2 of Nanjing Subway, which enables Xianlin and Gulou campus to be connected through subway.\nIn Gulou campus, there are several museums including Nanjing University Museum, Museum of Art and Archaeology, Museum of Earth Science. There is Sun Yat-sen House. It's said that Sun Yat-sen, the first president (provisional president) of the Republic of China, lived there. There are also Pearl Buck House, John Rabe House, etc.. Gulou campus is now becoming mainly for professional graduate campus.\nThe location of Nanjing University has changed for several times, with historical campuses mainly in Fuzimiao (on the bank of Qinhuai River), Gulou, Chaotiangong and Sipailou (south of Qintian Mountain) areas. In addition, during Anti-Japanese War, its main campus moved to Shapingba, Chungking, with two auxiliary campuses, one in Bohsi, Chungking, and one in Hwahsiba, Chengdu, in some sense combined with Chongqing University and Western China University (now medical school of Sichuan University) respectively. It also deserves to mention that before the war, with the rapid development of the university, a new campus planned to cover an area of 8000 mu (about 5.3 km2 or 2.0 sq mi) south to Niushou Mountain in the southern suburb area of Nanjing had been built for near a year. After the war, it moved back to Nanjing, making former campus Sipailou as main campus, and the new campus Dingjiaqiao was built for agriculture and medical schools. Nanjing University relocated in Gulou six years after moving back, and then near sixty years later Xianlin campus emerged. Today's Nanjing University Gulou campus is the location of Imperial University of Nanjing during Former Song dynasty in more than 1500 years ago when it was in the west of the city, and now it's in the centre of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Motto ===\nOfficially translated into English as \"Sincerity with Aspiration, Perseverance and Integrity\". Another version is \"Be Honest and Intelligent, Study Hard and Act Sincerely.\"(simplified Chinese: \u8bda\u6734\u96c4\u4f1f \u52b1\u5b66\u6566\u884c; traditional Chinese: \u8aa0\u6a38\u96c4\u5049 \u52f5\u5b78\u6566\u884c; pinyin: ch\u00e9ng p\u01d4 xi\u00f3ng w\u011bi l\u00ec xu\u00e9 d\u016bn x\u00edng)\nThe first half of this motto was the motto during the National Central University time, and the last half was quoted from the classic literature work Book of Rites. It was voted to be the motto by university students in 2002, and the then university president supported it and wrote an article to interpret it.The translation does not fully express the meaning of the Chinese words of the motto. Motto counterparts between Chinese and English literally: Cheng (\u8bda, Sincerity, Honesty, Integrity), Pu (\u6a38, Simplicity, Austerity, naturally being oneself), Xiong (\u96c4, Sturdiness, Majesty, being vigorous and keeping ideal and ambition, being firm and persistent with fortitude), Wei (\u5049, Greatness, having great ideal and ambition, with great mind comprehending, containing and improving world), Li Xue (\u52f5\u5b78, Endeavor to Learn), Dun Xing (\u6566\u884c, Urge to Act, Act Sincerely). The term Dun Xing comes from the context in Book of Rites: Having broad knowledge and strong learning ability and being modest, acting in sincerity and benignity and not slack, that is a gentleman (gentleperson) (\u535a\u805e\u5f37\u8b58\u800c\u8b93 \u6566\u5584\u884c\u800c\u4e0d\u6020 \u8b02\u4e4b\u541b\u5b50).\n\n\n=== Song ===\nThe university song, recovered in 2002, was created in 1916.

        "wiki": "Zhenjiang, alternately romanized as Chinkiang, is a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu Province, China. It lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze River near its intersection with the Grand Canal. It is opposite Yangzhou (to its north) and between Nanjing (to its west) and Changzhou (to its east). Zhenjiang was formerly the provincial capital of Jiangsu and remains as an important transportation hub.\nThe town is best known both in China and abroad for its fragrant black vinegar, a staple of Chinese cooking.\n\n\n== Names ==\nPrior to the adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the city's name was typically romanized as Chin-keang-foo, Chen-kiang-fu, or Chinkiang.\nFormer names include Jingkou and Runzhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA part of Zhenjiang was the possession of Ce, who was created the Marquess of Yi in the early Western Zhou. Then the region was renamed Zhufang and Guyang, supposedly. After it was captured by the First Emperor of the Qin in 221 BC, it became a county seat and was given the name Dantu. A Chinese legend holds that the site's fengshui was so advantageous that the First Emperor ordered 3000 prisoners to dig a tunnel through one of Zhenjiang's hills to dissipate its qi. It became a prefectural seat during the middle of the 3rd century BC.The Sui took the city in AD 581 and made it an important garrison on the lower Yangtze, the source of its present name. In 595, it was made a commandery seat. Its importance grew with the construction of the Grand Canal, after which it served as the chief collection and transit center for the grain tax paid by the farmers of the Yangtze delta. The city flourished from the 10th to 13th centuries, when it produced fine silks, satins, and silverware for the Song emperors. The 11th-century scientist and statesman Shen Kuo composed his 1088 Dream Pool Essays during his retirement in a garden estate on the outskirts of the city. It was taken by the Mongolians during their 1275 campaign against the Song capital at Hangzhou. Under the Yuan, some Nestorian Christians were reported living in the city. The city fell to Xu Da on 17 March 1356. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Zhenjiang had a vast amount of shipping, more so than any other city in the world. The ships which worked the city were all painted white and doubled as businesses such as taverns or other gathering spots The Southern Ming placed the town under Zheng Zhifeng, brother of Zheng Zhilong and favorite uncle of Koxinga, although he was fooled into wasting most of his ammunition against a feint and abandoned the city to the Qing on 1 June 1645.Under the Qing, Zhenjiang was a city of half a million surrounded by a series of brick city walls up to 35 feet (11 m) high. It was captured by the British on 21 July 1842 during the First Opium War and after a fierce resistance, leaving the path open to Nanjing and prompting a concessionary treaty to avoid its loss. A decade later, massive floods of the Yellow River altered its course north of Shandong and closed the northern path of the Grand Canal. Soon after, the town was sacked by the Taiping rebels in 1853. It was recaptured by the Qing in 1858 and opened as a treaty port in 1861. Into the 1870s, Chaozhou merchants used their connections in Zhenjiang to make it a regional distribution center for opium purchased from the foreign merchants in Shanghai; when David Sassoon attempted to avoid taxation by delivering his cargoes directly to the opium merchants in Zhenjiang, the Chinese organized to intimidate his customers and then bought out his failed organization. The population was estimated at 168,000 in 1904.\n\nThe southern part of the Grand Canal was obstructed in the early 20th century, although by that point the city was connected by rail to Shanghai and Nanjing. The Nationalist government revoked the British concession at Zhenjiang in 1929.\nFrom 1928 to 1949, while Nanjing served as the capital of the Republic of China, Zhenjiang served as the provincial capital for Jiangsu. During World War II, the city fell to Japan's Shanghai Expeditionary Army in the morning of 8 December 1937, shortly before the capture of Nanjing, but local resistance to the Japanese is still celebrated among the Chinese. When the Communists won the Chinese Civil War and relocated the capital to Beijing, Nanjing resumed its role as Jiangsu's capital.\nZhenjiang is still one of China's busiest ports for domestic commerce, serving as a hub for trade among Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai. The trade mostly consists of grain, cotton, oils, and lumber. The other main industries are mostly in the field of food processing and paper pulp manufacturing.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Zhenjiang administers 6 county-level divisions, including three districts and three county-level cities.\nThese are further divided into 77 township-level divisions, including 66 towns, 1 township and 10subdistricts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs in Nanjing, Zhenjiang's old Wu dialects have been entirely supplanted by a dialect of Eastern Mandarin. It is incomprehensible to the residents of neighboring Changzhou, whose dialect remains a form of Taihu Wu.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nZhenjiang is most famous for its fragrant black vinegar. Chinese legend traces it to Heita, the son of Dukang, the supposed inventor of alcoholic beverages. Having forgotten about a vat of wine for 21 days, he found it had spoiled but now possessed a pleasant sour taste that could be used to complement foods. The present recipe is said to date back 1400 years, with its major modern manufacturer\u2014the Jiangsu Hengshun Vinegar Industry Co.\u2014dating to 1840.Other local specialties include crab cream bun, Chinkiang pork (\u93ad\u6c5f\u80b4\u8089, akin to head cheese), and pickled vegetables. Formerly, households in Zhenjiang would prepare for the new year by eating a red-bean dish and avoiding rice. One bowl of beans was left on the table to feed the home's flies, from the belief that they would then avoid disturbing the family during the new year festivities.A natural spring in a park on the edge of Zhenjiang has been famed since the Tang (7th\u20139th century) as the best in Jiangsu for making tea. It is now marketed as the \"First Spring under Heaven\".\nThe hilly scenery in Zhenjiang's southern suburbs was considered beautiful enough to be the theme of many landscapes by Chinese painters. The 15th-century Japanese ink-wash master Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d studied in Zhenjiang.The local Jinshan temple appears in the tale of Madame White Snake and inspired a replica in the Kangxi Emperor's garden at Chengde.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nZhenjiang is located in the convenient Yangtze River Delta transport corridor, at the crossroads of the Grand Canal and the Yangtze, and between the Shanghai and Nanjing economic regions. The Port of Zhenjiang is the third largest port on the Yangtze.  The city has two Yangtze River crossings.  The Runyang Yangtze River Bridge complex, which has one of the one of the longest suspension bridge spans in the world, connects to Yangzhou.  The Taizhou Yangtze River Bridge, one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world, connects Yongzhong with Taizhou.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nZhenjiang has been connected by rail since 1906, at the completion of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. The railway was extended to Beijing after the completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in 1968, connecting Zhenjiang to China's political and commercial hubs. The primary railway station was Zhenjiang West Railway Station, which was demolished in 2004 due to congestion it caused in the city center. Since then Zhenjiang Railway Station has served as the city's principal railway station. Since April 2010, Zhenjiang has been on the route of the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Rail, the first high-speed rail with a design speed of over 300 km/h (186 mph) to serve the city. In 2011, the Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway was completed. Trains on the line stop at Zhenjiang South Railway Station. The two high-speed lines have reduced travel time between Zhenjiang and Shanghai to under an hour, and travel time to Beijing to under five hours. Rail service to Shanghai is frequent - averaging one train in less than half an hour.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nZhenjiang does not have a commercial airport within its city limits, although there is a military airfield, Zhenjiang Dalu Airport (\u9547\u6c5f\u5927\u8def\u673a\u573a), which may open to regional flights in the future. Zhenjiang city center is 62 km (39 mi) away from Changzhou Benniu Airport, about a one-hour drive (80 km or 50 mi) away from Nanjing Lukou International Airport via Nanjing Provincial Highway 243, and approximately a two-hour (143 km or 89 mi) drive away from Sunan Shuofang International Airport. Check-in facilities are available for Lukou Airport in the New Zhenjiang Bus Station (\u9547\u6c5f\u6c7d\u8f66\u65b0\u7ad9).\n\n\n=== Roadways ===\nZhenjiang is on the route of Beijing-Shanghai Expressway, and China National Highway 312.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAs of 2014, Zhenjiang had an extensive number of bus routes - numbering nearly one hundred. Since 2012 the city's entire fleet of city buses are equipped with GPS and are managed centrally through a \"smart transport network system.\"\n\n\n== Industry ==\nZhenjiang Export Processing Zone was approved by the State Council on March 10, 2003 with a total planned area of 2.53 square kilometres (0.98 square miles). The first-phrase project completed in December 2003 covers 0.91 square kilometres (0.35 square miles) and was certified by the Customs General Administration and other seven ministries for operation on Dec.24, 2003. Zhenjiang Export Processing Zone is located close to Changzhou Airport and Zhenjiang Port.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPublic institutions having full-time Bachelor's degree programs include Jiangsu University (\u6c5f\u82cf\u5927\u5b66) and the Jiangsu University of Science and Technology (\u6c5f\u82cf\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b66). Zhenjiang is home to the Silkworm Raising Research Institute of the Academy of Agricultural Science of China. The Shaozong Library includes a 100-volume collection of sayings and proverbs dating from the 7th to 11th centuries.\nSenior high schools are Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang No. 1 High School (\u6c5f\u82cf\u7701\u9547\u6c5f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b66), the Zhenjiang High School of Jiangsu Province (\u6c5f\u82cf\u7701\u9547\u6c5f\u4e2d\u5b66) and the Jiangsu Provincial Dagang High School (\u6c5f\u82cf\u7701\u5927\u6e2f\u4e2d\u5b66).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nLiu E (1848\u20131909), late Qing Dynasty writer\nPearl S. Buck also known as Sai Zhenzhu (Chinese: \u8cfd\u73cd\u73e0), (1892\u20131973), Nobel Prize-winning author of The Good Earth and other novels about China, lived in Zhenjiang with her missionary parents until the age of 18. Her parents' home is preserved on the grounds of a semiconductor factory in Zhenjiang; nearby is Zhengiiang Number 2 Middle School at which she studied and taught.\nLi Lanqing (born 1932), former vice premier of China.\nShen Kuo (1031\u20131095), Song Dynasty Scientist.\nHudson Taylor (1832\u20131905), British Missionary, Buried in Zhenjiang\nWei Wei (born 1922), film actress\nSi Guo  (1918-2004), English name Frederick Tsai, renowned essayist & translator who worked in Hong Kong for most of his career\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n Kisk\u0151r\u00f6s, Hungary\n Kuching, Malaysia\n Stavropol, Russia\n Tsu, Mie, Japan\n Tempe, Arizona, United States\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n Baynes, T.

As of 2020, there are 279 tourist attractions listed as 5A.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of the rating system for tourist attractions are based on criteria first set out in 1999 by the China National Tourism Administration (predecessor to the current Ministry of Culture and Tourism) and revised in 2004. The criteria includes quality and management factors like ease of transportation links, site safety, cleanliness, etc. and also takes into account the uniqueness and recognition of the sightseeing offering. Tourist attractions were graded according to the criteria on a scale initially from  A to AAAA with AAAAA or 5As added on later as the highest rating. A group of 66 tourist attractions were certified as the first set of AAAAA rated tourist attractions in 2007. The first batch included many of the most iconic historical sites in China including the Forbidden City and Summer Palace. Additional batches of additional sites have been added including 20 new 5A sites in February 2017. On rare occasions a few locations have been downgraded from the highest rating category for deficiencies in visitor experience.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== Downgrading ==\nTourist sites found deficient by the China National Tourism Administration (merged into the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2018) have lost their 5A accreditation due to deficiencies in visitor experience. In 2015, Shanhai Pass in Hebei was the first tourist site to be downgraded from 5A. The next wave of downgrading occurred in 2016 with the removal of Orange Isle in Hunan and Shenlong Gorge in Chongqing for \"security concerns, overpricing, poor environmental management and poor facility maintenance, as well as bad service mainly resulting from a lack of staff members.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of protected areas of China\nList of national parks of China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nComplete list of AAAA tourist attractions (Chinese) at the website of the central government of the People's Republic of China",

It borders the prefecture-level city of Nantong to the northeast across the Yangtze River. Due to the mild climate and terrain there, it has enjoyed a high level of agriculture civilization since ancient times, and is named after this, for the first character of its name (\u5e38) means \"always, often\", while the second (\u719f) means \"ripe\". The name of the adjacent county-level city of Taicang means \"great granary\".\n\n\n== History ==\nChangshu first became an independent county in 540 AD, but in 581 was made subordinate to Suzhou. It was promoted to seat of a full prefecture in 1295, was rebuilt and fortified in the 14th century, but in 1370 was reduced again to the level of a county. In the 15th and 16th centuries Changshu was several times attacked by Japanese pirates.\nChangshu has traditionally been a market town for locally produced rice, corn, wheat, tea, and mulberry leaves, and since the 13th century has been a major cotton-producing district. Although administratively still a subordinate city to Suzhou, it is a provincial base of foreign trade. Currently a harbour is being developed on the Yangtze River near Changshu to service Suzhou and Wuxi.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city's major industries include textiles, paper-making, fine chemicals, machinery, steel and forestry products. The city has more than 4,000 textile and apparel companies with combined annual sales of RMB50 billion. The paper-making industry has attracted more the US$15 billion of FDI. By the end of 2007, this industry exceeded 2.4 million tons.More than 2,000 foreign enterprises have invested in Changshu including big names such as Sharp and Dunlop. Of the contracted investment at least one-third has come from Taiwan \u2013 more than 500 Taiwan enterprises have invested more than US$100 million in the city. UPM-Kymmene from Finland has been running a paper mill in the city since 1999 and now has an annual capacity of 200,000 tons of coated and 600,000 tons of uncoated fine paper.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nChangshu is divided into nine towns and two subdistricts.\n\n\n=== Towns and subdistricts ===\nYushan (\u865e\u5c71)\nHaiyu (\u6d77\u865e)\nBixi subdistrict (\u78a7\u6eaa\u65b0\u533a)\nMeili (\u6885\u674e)\nXinzhuang (\u8f9b\u5e84)\nGuli (\u53e4\u91cc)\nZhitang (\u652f\u5858)\nDongbang (\u8463\u6d5c)\nShajiabang (\u6c99\u5bb6\u6d5c)\nShanghu (\u5c1a\u6e56)\nDongnan subdistrict (\u4e1c\u5357\u8857\u9053)\n\n\n=== Discontinued/Merged towns ===\nXushi (\u5f90\u5e02)\nHeshi (\u4f55\u5e02)\nRenyang (\u4efb\u9633)\nBaimao (\u767d\u8306)\nTangshi (\u5510\u5e02)\nXieqiao (\u8c22\u6865)\nDayi (\u5927\u4e49)\nMocheng (\u83ab\u57ce)\nWangzhuang (\u738b\u5e84)\nYetang (\u51b6\u5858)\nLiantang (\u7ec3\u5858)\nYangyuan (\u6768\u56ed)\nZhangqiao (\u5f20\u6865)\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nThe China National Highway 204 Yantai-Nantong-Changshu-Shanghai, Sujiahang Expressway and Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou all pass through Changshu.

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August.

        "wiki": "Daming Temple (Chinese: \u5927\u660e\u5bfa; pinyin: D\u00e0m\u00edng S\u00ec) is a temple located at the middle peak of Shugang Mountain, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China. This temple is known for a famous monk, Jianzhen, who studied the sutras and initiated people into monkhood here in 742 AD before he left for Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nDaming Temple is so named because it was constructed during the periods in the reign of Xiaowu Emperor of the Liu Song dynasty (453\u2013464 AD). In 581 AD, Qiling Tower was built in the temple as a place to offer sacrifices to the relic of Buddha.During the periods of the Wuzong reign of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), it was called Qiling Temple.\nIn the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), due to social taboo of \"Daming\" (Daming Chinese: \u5927\u660e means Ming dynasty), its name was changed into \"Qiling Temple\" (\u6816\u7075\u5bfa). In 1765, during the 30th year of Qianlong period (1736\u20131795), Qianlong Emperor honored the name \"Fajing Temple\" (\u6cd5\u51c0\u5bfa).In 1922, Japanese scholar Tokiwa Daijo (\u5e38\u76d8\u5927\u5b9a) built a pavilion, a gallery and a memorial hall before Daming Temple to commemorate master Jianzhen.In 1973, Jianzhen Memorial Hall, designed by Liang Sicheng, was constructed.In 1980, the temple reverted to its former name of \"Daming Temple\".\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe temple was constructed around the hill, which consisted of three parts. The central part consistes of the Hall of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" (\"F\u0113ng Ti\u00e1o Di\u00e0n\") and the Great Hall. The eastern part consisted of Pingyuan Hall and the \"Jianzhen Memorial Hall\". The western part consisted of Pingshan Hall, Si Garden and other features. The palaces and pavilions are well integrated with each other and well-arranged in structure.\n\n\n=== Memorial Hall ===\nThe Memorial Hall modeled the style of the Main Hall in the T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji which was organized and built by Jianzhen in Japan. A wood carving sitting statue of Jianzhen which was dry-lacquered and wrapped with linen layer by layer is enshrined in the hall.\n\n\n=== Pingshan Hall ===\nThe Pingshan Hall (\u5e73\u5c71\u5802) was built by Song dynasty scholar Ouyang Xiu in 1048 during the Qingli period when he was prefecture chief of Yangzhou. When people overlook the distant scenes, the mountains are at the same level with sight line, hence the name \"Pingshan Hall\" (\u5e73\u5c71\u5802; Ping means the same level and shan means mountains).\n\n\n=== Qiling Pagoda ===\nSome time during the Renshou reign of the Sui Dynasty - between 601 and 604 AD, the nine-story \"Qiling Pagoda\" (\u6816\u7075\u5854) was completed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReport on Water for Brewing Tea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nZi Yan (2012).

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth-most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District of Wuhan.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods. After the State of Huang was conquered by State of Chu in the summer of 648 BC, the people of Huang were moved into the area in and around present-day Wuhan. Local geographical terms including the name of Wuhan's Huangpi District were named after the State of Huang. Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BC.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought in the region over control of Jiangxia Commandery, territories of which included much of present-day eastern Hubei. In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four trading centers. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Smith Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape \u2013 they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain\u2014low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe sub-provincial city of Wuhan currently comprises 13 districts. As of the Sixth Census of China in 2010, the 13 districts comprised 160 township-level divisions including 156 subdistricts, 3 towns, 1 townships.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic missions ===\n\nThere are four countries that have consulates in Wuhan:\n\nThe current U.S. Consul General, the Honorable Mr. Jamie Fouss, was posted to Wuhan in August 2017. The office of the U.S. Consulate General, Central China (located in Wuhan) celebrated its official opening on November 20, 2008 and is the first new American consulate in China in over 20 years. The consulate is currently scheduled to offer visa and citizen services in the Fall of 2018.\nIn 2015, Japan\nand Russia announced their intentions to establish consular offices in Wuhan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nUp until the 21st century, Wuhan was largely an agricultural region. Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993. Its current zone size is about 10\u201325 square km and it plans to expand to 25\u201350 square km. Industries encouraged in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone include Auto-mobile Production/Assembly, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals Production and Processing, Food/Beverage Processing, Heavy Industry, and Telecommunications Equipment.\n\nWuhan Export Processing ZoneWuhan Export Processing Zone was established in 2000. It is located in Wuhan Economic and Technology Development Zone, planned to cover 2.7 square kilometers (1.0 square mile) of land. The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. Commuting across the Yangtze River and Han River has been the bottleneck of Wuhan traffic. However, the appearance of Wuhan Metro greatly relieved this problem.  With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park. Another famous flower is the lotus. The lake has a long history and especially the Chu Kingdom is well represented around East Lake. Moreover, in the Moshan Botanic Garden there are many types of plum blossoms, as well as lotus flowers.\nThe Hubei Provincial Museum: With over 200,000 valued artifacts, this is one of the leading museums in China. Especially the artefacts from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (Zeng Hou Yi), who lived in the 5th century BC, is a world unique treasure. The bell chime of Marquis Yi of Zeng is a bronze instrument performed 2430 years ago in ancient China (Warring States Period), and was discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in Suizhou, Hubei in 1978.

The University has three main campuses located in the Wuchang District.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe headquarters of Hubei Television is located in Wuchang District. Tortoise Mountain TV Tower is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when Hankow Times, a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. Chao-wen Hsin-pao, founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan). During the Northern Expedition era (1926\u20131928), journalism in Wuhan came to a climax; more than 120 newspapers and periodicals, including national newspapers such as Central Daily News and Republican Daily News, were founded or published during this time. Chutian Metropolis Daily and Wuhan Evening News are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers. Both of them have entered the list of 100 most widely circulated newspapers of the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research. Local wild plums were used medicinally during the Qin and Han dynasties. Cultivation of the fruit began during the Song dynasty. Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWuhan natives speak a variety of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHubei cuisine is one of China's ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian \u2013 Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

Russia denies that the Su-24 was flying in Turkish airspace and claims that antiaircraft artillery shot it down while it was flying over Syria. Both crew members eject from the Su-24; Russia claims that Syrian rebels fire at the pilot in his parachute while he drifts to earth and kill him, while the navigator escapes.

          "A reminder of cruel history of Nanjing on Japanese massacre right before 2nd world war. A history to be learnt and felt. I have read about this massacre in history books. But visiting this place has given me the same somber feeling I have had from my trip to Hiroshima peace",
          "Given the historical significance, I would say this is a \"must see\", but I did not find it all that great. If you have read Iris Chang's book \"The Rape of Nanjing\", you are not going to learn anything really new at the museum, and I didn't find the presentation all that",
          "The museum itself is worth a visit. It is well planned and there are English explanations. Just beware that it is a zoo. I was absolutely appalled at how the Chinese acted in a museum of this importance. Loud, pushy, tour guide with a microphone, far too many people allowed in",
          "So my husband and I had some time before our flight in the evening. I read about this memorial before heading here but when you arrived at the memorial it\u2019s not just about the outdoor statues. The memorial was built around the area where the massacre happened and what impressed",
          "It's a very big memorial but rightly so. The english translations are very good and the accounts of the events are presented in an engaging way. Definitely worth a visit, we should all learn past atrocities.",
          "First heard of the events and people memorialised here some years ago in a UK TV documentary. You can't miss this if visiting Nanjing. A genuine meaningful experience.",
          "I've read about the rape of Nanjing but seeing the memorial really drove the points home. I know for years that area was undeveloped because it's a well known mass grave site in Nanjing, so no one wanted to develop here which is fortunate for building such a beautiful memorial.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing. The work that went into the facilities and the scale of it all makes it well worth the trip. My only complaint was the tone of some the inscriptions. While this was undoubtedly a serious war crime, I think there was too much of a focus on",
          "The memorial site is very big and you could easily spend a whole afternoon or half day there. The grounds are gorgeous and the information is very detailed. I thought it was quite aggressively translated in some sections. Very well done.",
          "The memorial of the Nanjing massacre is a really interesting place to learn about the plight of the Chinese people during the occupation by Japan. The complex is quite large and very well done. The displays are all in English so it was very easy to follow and we spent about 2",
          "As a historian who visits China frequently, I had been wanting to visit this important museum and memorial. Allow at least two hours for a quick tour and longer if you like to read everything. Each exhibit has an excellent English translation of the Chinese text. The museum",
          "This is an impressive memorial to the universal inhumanity of war. The care and thought put into the layout evokes the proper horror and humility that comes from the barbarity of mankind at its worst.",
          "The memorial is very well done, informing, and respectful. If ever in Nanjing it\u2019s worth the time to stop by! It\u2019s free. There are indoor and outdoor parts to walk through and very good English translations.",
          "The Memorial Hall stands on the top of the biggest burial sites of the victims. The outdoor exhibition area displaces sculptures, relief carvings, and a large wall listing the names of victims. The interior houses sheltered skeletal remains of victim, as well as a hall where",
          "it was chinese new year holiday when we got here..probobly 11 am..be sure to eat breakfast first because you will spend 1 or 2 hrs in the line.it was raining,and yet still heavy line..when you enter the premises,there is still another line inside beforeactually getting inside",
          "An Interesting museum in a good space. It was very busy when we visited (Chinese New year holidays) so we rather got swept through as opposed to taking our time!",
          "Well done but not a good attraction. A sad episode. You do walk down through the exhibit and learn a lot.",
          "I write this review only as a word of caution. That being said, there are two parts to the entire grounds of the complex. The forst part of the complex is what most visitors want to see and to visit to pay their respects to the dead. It was raining really hard and the lines were",
          "As an expat who actually lives and teaches in China, I see and hear racist comments from my students (who are college age) against the nation of Japan from time to time. I\u2019m not here to say whether that\u2019s right or wrong, but it shows the deep-seated, inherited unwillingness to",
          "it was great trip for me to walk the whole place. first it is free. so you wont need worry about how much to pay. the moment you walk into the place, the sculptures really bring you immediately into the horrible scene. the names on the wall , the stones, the photos ,everything",
          "Very interesting museum and memorial for the Japanese genocide. Horror of the worst kind giving a terrifying experience. But made in a great informative and illustrative way. Absolutely a must if you are in Nanjing except maybe not with small children who hardly can understand",
          "We were specifically visited Nanjing because want to see this Memorial that one of famous memorial around China. It was a packed of people inside there especially chinese visitors. The situation inside memorial was 70% dark. Some of people bring flowers and China flags. Many",
          "This memorial and museum is much larger than at first glance. It could very easily turn into a visit lasting an entire day if you're into history circa 1912 (end of Qing Dynasty) - late 1940s (end of WW2 and end of Chinese Civil War). There is a vast set of materials in this",
          "If you want to feel hatred against the human brutality, it is strongly recommended to pay a visit to this terrific museum.",
          "The museum grounds is very solemn and poignant. After the security checks, you enter a walkway where statues of the various suffering the citizens of Nanjing underwent during the war. Inside the complex there are donated bell, cross, and other reminders for peace. A wall which",
          "We visited Nanjing specifically to visit this memorial. It is important for all future generations to see this place so as not to repeat the past. It is very well done and evokes admiration for those who made efforts to save lives during this dark period. Just go and experience",
          "In absence of the write up of the atrocity committed by Japanese army in Nanjing , this place serves an important reminder to the world that Peace is priceless but is so fragile not to be taken lightly.",
          "As an avid advocate of peace the monument stands witness of what humans can do to humans under orders of animals. I am ashamed and fearful looking at this reminder of the atrocities of WWII. Let\u2019s work to educate the people and the world that war is ugly. Let\u2019s work and promote",
          "I have lived in Nanjing for the past few months and definitely appreciate this place more after visiting the memorial as well as the museum.",
          "There was none of the stereotypically abhorrent behaviour seen from any of the mostly Chinese visitors to this most solemn of museums. Expect orderly queues, hushed tones and very civil behaviour from the attendees. The site itself begins with a walk along large bronze statues",
          "This is both the saddest place and yet most incredible. Words cannot express how I felt having viewed the horror and inhumanity that occurred. However numbing this was, its equal if not greater experience is the documented acts of bravery in saving lives, and the incredible",
          "First, do not go on a crowded day - it ruins the otherwise somber setting. Second, be respectful - this represents one of the worst atrocities committed by the Japanese military against innocent Chinese civilians in World War II, which was significantly longer for China than for",
          "Hallowed ground for Chinese people this museum is built upon the site of a mass grave from the massacre, the remains of which you can see. The small museum is informative and multilingual, so if you\u2019re unsure of the history behind Sino-Japanese antagonism then take your time to",
          "A must-go. The experience may get to you, as it\u2019s graphic in spots. Still, the learning of this event in history is essential. Also, go see the nearby WWII museum. It was huge and well worth the visit too.",
          "A fitting memorial to the 300000 men, women and children massacred from 13December 1937 until January 1938. The memorial exhibits historical records and objects, and uses architecture, sculptures and videos to illustrate what happened during the Nanjing massacre. The memorial",
          "Yes, this museum tells history from one side, the side of the victim. Yes, it may be used for propaganda in that sense. None of that makes what happened any less true and none of that should prevent anyone from visiting this memorial. Maybe also watch a couple of movies at home",
          "It is a terrific museum giving a very crude illustration of the illness of men to conduct war and destroy everything.The japanese war were a complete massacre of people living in Nanjing area . The memorial is exactly whet we needde to remember those terrific days and educate",
          "Not an amusing and entertaining tourist site, but one of the highest \"must to see\" in China... It gives a wide and clear (and shocking....) view about the Japanese massacre in Nanjing at the time of the 2nd. World War and a warning reminder to humanity about how easy people and",
          "Even though I went about an hour before closing time, I thought I would have sufficient time. There were a lot of people entering at the same time as I did, but it was not enough time! There is a course you have to follow, from one building to another, so I felt it was quite",
          "Nanjing Memorial Place is a must if you got the chance to see it. I am living only one hour away from Nanjing and have seen it a few times. Sad memories which had not really to do with war. Brutal humans raped and murdered so many Chinese in all ages. Very sad reminder.",
          "I knew about the Nanjing Massacre, but many Chinese youngsters do not. Some of them are crazy with Japanese stars. My guide took me to the museum on my first day of visit. Good idea. The lay out can be frightening like the poor man who was so chopped up that his head and",
          "This site is absolutely brilliantly layout, and is a fantastic memorial, to remind people of the horrors of war. However when you read about this Nanjing Massacre, this was nothing to do with War, but basically brutal, human beings against the Chinese, rapes,murders, crime",
          "A solemn place. Lots of statues to depict the suffering of the Japanese victims. A special exhibit devoted the non Chinese hero's who helped. An big model of an excation site. Very meaningful as I wrote a book of the world war two in Borneo",
          "The Memorial and museum present excellent and balanced views of the massacre and what we in the west call World War II. The exhibits are compelling with title cards in English. It's hard to fathom the extent of the evil. Countering that are the stories of the people, like John",
          "We went this morning before heading back to Shanghai. The tour is very well laid out. Crowds were not big at all and we did the full tour in 40 mins. It's free to get in. You must see this if you are going to Nanjing",
          "I visited the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall in July 2017. Despite the crowds, the museum is an absolute must visit in Nanjing and is probably the best museum I have visited in China. The museum is part outdoor exhibition and part indoor information centre. The information",
          "If you're staying in Nanjing as a tourist you will no doubt be wondering whether to visit her, and chances are that you will. Apart from being confronting about the obvious theme, it is very L - O - N - G. Of a group of several people, all but one was starting to look for the",
          "Visited during a National Holiday, it was very busy but the queue was managed well and so we were not waiting too long. You'll see excavations on unimaginable scales, and then the following exhibitions are very well done. The exhibition does have tinges of pro-nationalist",
          "A lesson in the brutality of war. The Chinese government uses this sad chapter of history to stoke the fires of nationalism.",
          "A deeply moving and thought provoking memorial. One of the more significant events in a very troubled century in China, the \"Rape of Nanking\" is excellently presented in both Chinese and English. A mixture of photos, stories, sculptures, gardens and places for reflection as well",
          "Not to many words needed. This site was the main reason I visited Nanjing. It was not a pleasant visit due to the specific history detailed. Overall the exhibits are well-done. It might be worthwhile to do a little research before visiting.",
          "This place is very well done and extremely moving emotionally. Japanese tourism to the area greatly declined once this opened, understandably. Vivid presentation both with pictures, actual mass grave sites, video and sculptures. All of Nanjing was a must do with a local tour",
          "Good place to understand the history of the Nanjing Massacre. Solemn place. 3 exhibition area. Need to queue for security check",
          "This was the Second place on my checklist for the trip to Nanjing. It was worth going there to know about the history and the incidents during the World War II (When Japanese attacked China).The place is well connected with Metro but can be overcrowded during the weekdays as",
          "We went on a Tuesday afternoon thinking there would be less of a crowd. We were wrong. Very Informative but some of the statues and quotes are over the top. I do recommend if you are at all interested in the history of Nanjing or China. Everything is in English and Chinese,",
          "An impressive and comprehensive museum documenting the events leading up to the Nanjing massacre with impressive architectural monuments and a somber exposed mass grave site. Would've been better if there weren't that many people there",
          "Pros: comprehensive (if brutal) information about the Nanjing Massacre and the relevant historical context of the period; free; air-conditioned; information provided in English. Cons: Poorly curated (for the average visitor, it would feel like somebody took a year's syllabus",
          "This memorial is a must visit if you want to understand Nanjing and modern China. I was impressed with the lasting message from this memorial - that we must remember the victims of this atrocity but strive towards peace. It's not a pleasant couple of hours and I wouldn't take",
          "Revisited this museum after 7 years, it is still very well maintained and it is still very emotional experience. While the crowds are noticeably increased, it will remain as my favorite museum in Nanjing.",
          "The\" Massacre of Nanking \" as meticulously documented in this Memorial not only pays tribute to the 300,000 victims, but it reminds the whole world what the Japanese military did to millions of civilians in China and Asia a generation or two ago. It is a lesson on the terror of",
          "You know you are going to a memorial, but nothing can prepare you for the heart-rending sculptures or the sheer number of victims. Well done Memorial with lots of history.",
          "Heartbreaking to remember what happened in Nanjing over a 6-week period in 1937-1938. A beautiful memorial to the 300,000 victims. A word of caution...if the weather is hot, go as early as possible. Also, out of respect for those who died, there are no chairs or benches until",
          "This is one of the best memorials that I have ever seen. It is much larger than I initially thought. The exhibits are very well laid out with excellent explanations in Chinese and English. Such a tragic time in China's history, but really shows the resiliency of the Chinese",
          "A real look into the history of Nanjing in WW2 with the invasion of the Japanese Imperial Army. I didn't feel like there was much (if any) propaganda put forward like there are at some other similar destinations in China, and from the research I had done prior to heading here,",
          "I'm not sure what it is to be honest, but I didn't feel like this memorial was as impactful as I had hoped it to be. I went in expecting to cry buckets like I did at the 9/11 memorial but felt like it fell short on the actual accounts of people. The memorial to me felt like a",
          "As a ww2 geek and especially the pacific theatre, since they do not teach this in Europe at all apart from few sling events, I took some classes in university about Japan's campaign. The memorial was really educational and made in a style that invoked a lot of emotions. Great",
          "This memorial to a dreadful event is striking in its elegance and its reverence. This is not a shrine to hatred or revenge but is a quite beautiful site to remember mans inhumanity to man. To understand China... the events behind this memorial are one of the elements that has",
          "The first time I visited the massacre museum I didn't know what we were visiting. However, it was very apparent what we were in for the second I took notice of the statues that lined the pathway to the entrance. Each statue depicted the brutality and reality of the Japanese",
          "The Memorial of the Nanjing Massacre was educational, and very broadening. Prior to this visit, I had no knowledge of the atrocities that took place in Nanjing and across China during World War II. This memorial needs to be a necessary visit for anyone coming to Nanjing.",
          "This memorial is great from the start. Long walk in but prepares you. Sculptures, walls, hills, all impressive. The exhibits themselves include pictures, explanations, much in English, and audio visual stuff as well. It ends in a burial ground. Not a big spot to feel good",
          "I read many comments before visiting this place. It was not what I expected. I was given the impression it was to commemorate what all happened in Nanjing (and China) in the 1930s and 1940s. But, as another just posted, it's more. It covers all of WWII - ETO as well as",
          "If you know the history of Japan and China in WW2, you need to visit this place. All too often in China things are over the top and kinda tacky, but this place has class and dignity. I was very impressed by it all. Not for the faint of heart. We went at about 1:00pm on a",
          "Good to see. Lots of subjective comments in the museum but worth a visit. I discovered a part of history I knew little about.",
          "It's not for the faint of heart. It's like visiting a concentration camp. However we all need to know the ills of our history so it's never repeated. It may affect your mood for the rest of the day though so be prepared.",
          "An amazingly moving tribute to the many innocent who lost their lives . The whole museum is truly inspiring and humbling . The bronze statues to honour those who lost loved ones and suffered are amazing crafted and one can't help buy be moved . Everything has been done with so",
          "This Memorial is a moving place, a reminder of man's inhumanity in times of war. Any person would be moved by the images, the excavated remains, and the inspiration of those who survived it, and the group of westerns who risked their own lived to protect the less fortunate. The",
          "From the Nanjing south train station it was a 45 minute metro trip with one change. The site was sobering and moving. I had read The Rape of Nanking and that background helped understand all that I was seeing. The flow was well planned and took the visitor from grasping the",
          "Memorial to highlight how bad we humans can be at times to each other....not the happiest place to enjoy a visit, but local Chinese explanation as to why they visit so much is understandable.",
          "I visited here in March 2017. The Nanjing Massacre of 1937 was a very sad and tragic period in Chinese history. The Japanese army murdered an estimated 300,000 people. There are statues outside including a plaque which says 300,000 victims in many languages. The museum and",
          "Of course The Nanjing Massacre Memorial is a compulsory visit for anyone in Nanjing. The memorial is well arranged and tells the story of the massacre in depth. A sombre place as is to be expected. The additional museum about the wider fight against Japan and Nazi Germany was",
          "After coming out from exit 2, you will have to cross a small street and line up for baggage scanning before entering to the museum. At this point, it is a good idea to go there on weekdays due to less traffic. If you visit the place on weekend, you will have to wait in line",
          "I went here over the May 1st holiday weekend. Unfortunately it was extremely crowded due to the holiday and free entrance, so I did not get to take the time to really take in everything. So be warned about trips there during holidays. As for the museum itself, it is one of the",
          "Excellent museum with shocking accounts of the Nanjing massacre. Not for the faint hearted. As with all Chinese attractions, you must be prepared for crowds that will test your patience.",
          "It seems to me that many in the West don't know what went on in China prior to the start of WW2. Set in a sombre, underground building, surrounded by a respectfully grassed graveyard you get to see & read about events that occurred in Nanjing. The photographs are vivid & reading",
          "I went there on a Tuesday in April, and it was fairly crowded because it looked like there were a few field trips going on. I was happy to find that there was a place to store your bags and to rent an audio tour. The museum progresses in one direction so that everyone is going",
          "Visited Nanjing for the first time and this was the only place I really wanted to visit here. The memorial is done up very nicely with many photos and testimonials of the atrocities carried out so many years ago. It is a really good place for locals and tourists alike to visit",
          "This is a new exhibition of this historical event It is quite confronting but is very well presented I can recommend going there as well as Nanjing itself . Nanjing has much to offer the tourist and I found it very interesting It is an easy bullet train trip from Shanghai",
          "A rather tough memorial place. Very well setup. Try to go on a weekday as it was too many people when i was there.",
          "This is a powerful memorial that commemorates a dark moment in Chinese history - the infamous Rape of Nanking atrocity committed by the Japanese in World War 2. Words can't really do the horrors justice, but this exhibit stands as a reminder.",
          "The Memorial to the Nanjing Massacre is easily accessible by taxi even from the outer city areas where we were staying near Nanjing University. From the beginning of the visit you were struck by the horror and suffering of the people of Nanjing during the invasion. Statues",
          "I visited the memorial on a weekday, and I would highly recommend this time period for everyone. It was crowded - we are in China after all. However, the crowds were at a minimum and it made the endeavor less stressful than had it been a holiday or weekend. I was quite",

          "A must see... but not on a public holiday! We attempted to go on the last day of Chingming festival and promptly retreated as the queues were around the block. However, this does testament to what a great museum this is. The event of the Nanjing Massacre are well documented and",
          "One of the most tell-tale memorials that depicts the one-month \"rape\" of Nanjing under the hands of the Japanese empire. The museum is well designed and lays out the atrocities of the time. It is really one of the events leading up to world war 2 that does not see much light",

          "The massacre which occurred here is meticulously researched and presented. There is way too much to take in if you were to try and read and see everything. It's pretty clear the atrocities were significant and had/have a big impact on the Chinese people. There is a constant",

          "Of course, there are cruel pictures and videos, but this museum shows one of the most important parts of Nanjing's history. It's absolutely worth it to visit and has a good a didactical approach. Maybe, just avoid the crowds and go there early morning. To get prepared, we",
          "My husband and i visited during spring festival and it was pretty crowded but worth it. You should be mentally prepared as you will see many crude images of war, death and devastation which can be a bit morbid at times. Still is a good reminder of human cruelty and a good",

          "It is of course a very somber site, but well worth visiting. It is easy to access, right outside the metro station. Be prepared for long lines to get in, but it moved along quickly. Free entrance. We went around lunchtime and I think that was a good choice as the line afterward",

          "This was one of the best sites to see in Nanjing. The crowds were crazy with field trips and other tourist. We wished it was more spread out and more English subtitles. We read the Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang before going to the city, so this is helpful in knowing the history.",
          "From the moment I stepped on the grounds of this Memorial I was filled with emotion. The series of sculpture that lead you to the entrance are unforgettable. They capture the very essence of pain, sadness, terror, separation of loved ones, and most of all despair. Inside the",

          "A place in memory of the deceased of war victims during invasion of Japanese from 1931 to 1945. Very depressing and sad after seeing the photo and video clip on how Japanese killed, tortured and raped the victims. Free entry from 0830 to 1630 daily except Sunday.",
          "If you go to one place in Nanjing this should be it. Even if you don't know much about history you should go. The site has lots of photos and descriptions dealing with this period of history. What is even worse is that towards the middle and end of the memorial you find out that",
          "As expected a very sombre and sad experience but a must-visit site in Nanjing. Entry was free and it was a long weekend. There were thousands of visitors. It was slow to move through the dark exhibition space. The didactic material is in Chinese Japanese and English. Harrowing",
          "It was good to learn about this part of history when Japaniese invaded China in 1937 but... In my opinion there is a lot of information in text to be read and it's difficult to focus on when there are hundreds of people around, not always keeping silence... I would expect also",
          "I was aware of the Nanjing Massacre prior to visiting the Memorial, but visiting this museuml really puts it into perspective. We have all heard about wartime atrocities, but this one claimed 300,000 victims in only ten days. The museum is very well planned, with numerous",
          "The place is interesting, easy to find by Metro and free in my case when going on sunday. It is really sad to see what happened at that time and how many victims died and how they did... It's a good place not to forget our history, you feel scared of some of the things you see",
          "Before I went to this place, I have read the comments posted by people who have been there before. It did not prepare me enough for what I was going to see. Indeed, words cannot describe the feeling which one gets by being physically there. Every statue told a story...of a",
          "This place is impressive for many reasons. The architecture and atmosphere of the memorial is quite striking ; you have to go through a kind of long walk in the outside park (with a lot of sculptures and even remaining skeleton of the victims (??) ) before reaching a kind a",
          "We visited on a Tuesday morning and it was packed with tourists and school children. The site is huge with extensive sculptures and memorials outside. The sculptures in the entrance are really worth seeing. The museum is educational, thought provoking and shocking. It explains",
          "Museums can be boring but not this place. And this memorial (museum) has been done so well. It was at the top of my list to visit in Nanjing. I think many museums miss their mark in what they are trying to achieve but not this one - it is a bullseye.",
          "If you want to try and understand the Chinese attitude to Japan this magnificent memorial to the 300,000 killed will certainly help. While the scale and horror of the needless slaughter are depicted in a factual and realistic way, the positive virtues of love and care for others",
          "It's a site full of information & historical facts about the Nanjing Massacre. But it's very dark both literally and not. My head hurt the whole time I was there. Great if you have a spare time because admission is free. Otherwise I would find a more cheerful & lighter place",
          "I have been to a lot of \"Dark Tourism\" sites and I have to admit this was the best so far! Lots of English signs and was a really moving experience.",
          "It's big and entails long walk. Not recommended for kids or you'll give them nightmares. It's dark and big and you have to go through all the areas since it's the only way out. It is a big horror house. The sounds can get quite freaky for the kids as well. Good for people who"

        "wiki": "The Sedgwick County Zoo is an AZA-accredited wildlife park and major attraction in Wichita, Kansas, United States.  Founded in 1971 with the help of the Sedgwick County Zoological Society, the zoo has quickly become recognized both nationally and internationally for its support of conservation programs and successful breeding of rare and endangered species.  Having over 3,000 animals of nearly 400 species, the zoo has slowly increased its visitors and now ranks as the number one outdoor tourist attraction in the state.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Downing Gorilla Forest ===\nDowning Gorilla Forest starts out in a recreation of a small Congo village with exhibits for De Brazza's monkey, colobus monkey, pink-backed pelican, and white pelican. Across a bridge is an exhibit for saddle-billed stork, as well as one for black crowned crane and okapi. The main attraction is a large gorilla exhibit. They can be viewed in their indoor home, outside through large viewing windows or across a moat.\n\n\n=== Pride of the Plains ===\nA path winds around exhibits of lions, red river hogs, and two exhibits of meerkats. Each exhibit has several views from all sides. The whole area has a kopje theme with giant boulders. At the end is an exhibit for African painted dogs.\n\n\n=== Penguin Cove ===\nOpened in 2007, Penguin Cove is the zoo's first marine exhibit, and home to a colony of Humboldt penguins. The $1.5 million exhibit features a 42,000-US-gallon (159,000 l) pool with rocky areas and coves on each side.\n\n\n=== African Veldt ===\nThis exhibit features bonteboks, reticulated giraffes, African bush elephants, hippos, and eastern black rhinos.  On 11 March 2016, six African elephants arrived at the zoo from Swaziland to escape a drought.A male African elephant, Ajani, from Birmingham Zoo, joined the six female elephants for breeding purposes in May 2018.\n\n\n=== Tiger Trek ===\nThis $3 million Asian themed naturalistic exhibit was opened in 2009, and houses Amur tigers, Malayan tigers, red pandas, bar-headed geese, brow-antlered deer, and more.\n\n\n== List of animals ==\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nTram tours are free and go throughout the zoo. Boat tours through the Africa and America sections are available for a fee.\n\n\n== The future ==\nThe zoo is currently planning a new zoo entrance and a new elephant management complex for the future, as well as some new additions to the Amphibians and Reptiles building.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn 6 May 2011, a first-grade student on a class field trip climbed over a four-foot fence then crossed the eight-foot gap of the Amur leopard exhibit. The boy was attacked. He suffered lacerations and puncture wounds to his head and neck before a bystander kicked the leopard in the head. The injuries were not considered life-threatening, and the zoo did not euthanize the endangered animal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSedgwick County Zoo raises ticket prices in 2017",

          "It had been several years since I visited and it always great to see the growth and how they maintain the property. An attraction to be proud of!!",
          "They do a very good job of giving the animals a humane habitat while still allowing the visitors to view the animals. It is not as good as the zoo in Omaha (another gem in a small city), but still one of the best things to do in Wichita on a nice day.",
          "Great choice for the kiddos. Surprisingly extensive variety of animals in a clean and modern surrounding.",

          "This zoo was so clean. We loved the children\u2019s farm. Our toddler had a blast petting and feeding the goats. The animals were very sleepy and lazy when we went. Could have been the time of day as we went in the morning. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 only because some of the",
          "The only reason for not giving it a five is that No concessions were open and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of the earliness of the season.A great time love love love the penguins. So many things to see that we ran out of time. Great petting zoo, enjoyed the arboretum. A great place",

          "Is a typical city zoo but a good one. Must stop for parents from smaller communities that don't have a zoo. Prices are discounted some days so wait until end of summer or early fall for best deals if you're local...",
          "The Zoo was average at best and most suitable for children. There are petting areas which included sheep and goats along with a learning exhibit about bees. There is a fun barn which would be suitable for possible kids parties too. The park itself is fairly small and can be seen",
          "In my opinion this blows any zoo within 250 miles away. Better than KC and on par with Omaha but even more inviting.",

          "Clean, good exhibits, not too big. My idea of a nice zoo. Spend a couple of hours strolling around to see the cats, monkeys, and other critters. Lots of fundraisers are held throughout the year, including the biggie, Zoobilee. Good idea for a nice afternoon.",
          "A nice zoo with lots of good walking paths. The two exhibits on Australia and South America were excellent and a great place to see all kinds of birds from those areas. I loved the sheer number and variety of macaws. You can tell the zoo is in the midst of modernizing as some",

          "The Sedgwick County Zoo is one of our family\u2019s favorite places to visit for many years. There is staff available throughout the zoo for any questions and the areas are well taken care of. Paths are clearly labeled with exhibit signs so it\u2019s easy to follow even without a map. Our",
          "Great to know and learn not only for children but also for adults. A lot of new animals the first time I see the live one. Must come for family. Just some areas aren\u2019t service to make us unhappy.",
          "My family and I went here on the Sunday of Memorial weekend. It wasn't too busy, and it was a blast! My brother and I (aged 21 and 18) felt like little kids gawking at the animals they had. My parents enjoyed it as well! This is one of the bigger zoos we have been too, as it",

          "They are Always well kept and striving to make improvements. We had lunch which I know is a little pricey but it goes to a good cause, is convenient, nice variety and the food is good. Zoo exhibits are some of the best in the nation. Entry is much cheaper than many other zoos",

          "Great time at the zoo with family. The staff are very friendly and helping, by getting two wheel chairs for the older parents, this made the day a lot easier. The layout puts all things to see in easy walking distance of each other. The elevation is flat so not a lot of hard",
          "This is a very nice zoo, but expensive!. It is also disappointing to me as a Wichita resident that they didn't spend their millions on something other than an Elephant exhibit. Especially since there is a huge one in Oklahoma City, OK which is only a couple of hours away. I",

          "What a beautiful zoo! The newest section, the elephants savanna habitat is wonderful. The story behind how the elephants landed at the zoo is a touching story. The gorilla exhibit is awesome. Closeup views of the gorillas from the \u201ctent\u201d is amazing! Don\u2019t miss this top",
          "I was a member of the wichita zoo. I had my grandson with me one morning. When the zookeeper thru a live white bunny into the cougar cage, right in front of us. Of course the sight of what happened is forever in my mind, not to mention my 4 yr. Old grandson. Think we both can",

          "This is an excellent zoo and rivals the quality of the Kansas City zoo. In fact, in many respects, I would say it is even better. The exhibits were varied and sorted by geographical region and the whole facility seemed very clean and well organized. Many exhibits are quite",

          "Many people don't realize this zoo was the pattern for the San Diego zoo. Wichita was the first in the country to design a \"real terrain\" zoo and it constantly works to stay cutting edge. I highly recommend you visit whenever you're in town.",
          "I have been to this zoo a few times in the last couple of years but it still needs improvements in other areas! Yes they made some improvements to the African Side but that\u2019s about all.They need to focus on Reptiles cause it\u2019s boring.You walk through reptile area and so many",
          "This is just a remarkable place, always improving and expanding; real treasure for Kansas, located in Wichita. There is so much to do and see, the tropical rain forest and all its animals, the apes, the gorillas in their new habitat, the elephants with their new additions and",

          "In my opinion this zoo is one of the best in the USA. It\u2019s not a lot of concrete and offers a lot of freedom for the children to see and run. Nice job housing and feeding the animals, beautiful surroundings and polite caring employees.",

          "I felt like half the animals were on vacation or on strike. Lots of exhibits were closed or we couldn't see them. It's a huge place but weird so much or little was going on.",

          "We love this zoo! They have wonderful experiences, and I don\u2019t feel like the animals are stressed out as much as at other zoos we\u2019ve been to.

          "Last year we decided to get a zoo membership so we would have a place to walk other than the park. We come to the zoo as often as we can and love that they have a program that rewards members for walking. Be sure to check out the birds in the Tropics area, the prairie dogs, and",
          "Nice clean zoo with many different types of animals to enjoy. Great way to spend the afternoon with the kids",
          "I live here and if you come to Wichita you really do need to see this. I recommend you pack a cooler though as food costs an arm and a leg. They have strollers and pulls carts but save some bucks and bring your own if you can. Take 5 minutes in the Gift Store as they have some",
          "From the tram ride to the boat ride, there is so much to do that one should plan to spend the whole day there to enjoy the whole zoo. The children enjoyed feeding the rhinos, and we enjoyed that the staff for the rhino feeding were very patient with the children and friendly.",
          "So if maybe they didn\u2019t charge so much to enter, people might go more often. It is sad when even school groups can\u2019t take the kids because of the fees.",
          "We had a great time with our family at this zoo. We try to visit the zoo in every city we visit with family. The zoo is laid out very well - it is pretty much a big loop. You can easily see everything in one visit. Some of our favorite areas were the gorillas and orangutans",

          "I'm not particularly a zoo person - but my wife is. I was pleasantly surprised that this zoo was not only just right sized - could be visited entirely in 2-3 hours but it was also well thought out. Animals are separated by area of origin and efforts have been made to tailor",
          "Love this zoo! Wichita really has one of the nicest I have been to. Such a great variety of animals and a beautiful place all tied into an area that is spread out just enough to not be crowded but not so far that you have to walk forever between attractions. Early in the day",
          "This is a nice medium size zoo worth of visiting. It is a little bit expensive compared to other larger zoos that we have been. There is a playground fro kids to play that is just too small for the amount of kids that usuallu can be find",

          "We took a trip to Wichita to visit the zoo. We had a friend in from Illinois. We also took our grandson to the zoo for the first time. We had a great day with the animals. The only part I wish would have been a bit better is that it was hard to see the elephants. I also found it",
          "We have been going to this zoo and have had a membership for around 10 years now. We've watched it change and grow. It does have its occasional problems, like the time I went at the end of summer and hunted through 3 bathrooms to find one with toilet paper, or when I bought a",
          "Winter visit so it was literally empty but what a great zoo! Beautifully laid out. Not the biggest or most animal laden zoo, but large enough for a few hour visit and great to walk around. If you have kids this is an ideal day outside. I can see why this is ranked #1 in Wichita",
          "One of best fundraising events in the Wichita area is Zoobilee. The annual event raises money to support the care housing of the animals. There are bands, restaurants set up kiosks, bars, etc. It is a great way to see the zoo, visit with friends, and raise money for a worthy",

          "We have been here before and the grandkids always enjoy going back. They can interact with some of the animals and enjoy that immensely.",
          "First off, like the no parking fee, and there was plenty of parking. We got there on a Saturday morning when they first opened, but it does cost to enter the zoo. Living in a city with no entry fee has spoiled us, lol. During our whole visit to the zoo the crowd was minimal and",
          "We visited on a mild, sunny Wednesday in mid-November. The grounds were beautiful, with the trees mostly still in color. The zoo has many water features, most with huge, colorful koi in them, and several with colorful waterfowl. Although many of the birds had been moved to",

          "This was a great way to see the 7 new elephants brought to our zoo! The addition of 1 male and 6 females makes the exhibition the best in the world. There were a total of 17 elephants brought to the US by Dallas, Omaha and Wichita Zoos and if they were not successfully brought",
          "This zoo is twice the price of the Oklahoma City Zoo and, in my opinion, not as nice at all. We visited yesterday and the weather was excellent, but so many of the animals were nowhere to be found. It was disappointing. I mean there are some good aspects of the zoo don't get me",

          "Best part of this zoo is there was no fighting the crowds like many others. Had all the exhibits you'd expect to find at a large metro zoo, probably just a bit smaller. Were there for 2 hours but could have easily spent 1-2 more and seen everything. Only issue is the cost seems",

        "wiki": "The Keeper of the Plains is a 13.4 metres (44 ft) Cor-Ten steel sculpture by Kiowa-Comanche artist Blackbear Bosin. It stands at the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers in Wichita, Kansas adjacent to the Mid-America All-Indian Center. Surrounding the base of the statue are multiple displays which describe the local tribes that used to inhabit this area, as well as several fire pits which sometimes light up to illuminate the statue at night. The fire pits, which are known as the Rings of Fire, are lit manually for public safety and run in 15-minute increments. They are generally lit once a night around 7 pm during the winter and sunset during the summer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe sculpture, commissioned by the city and private organizations to mark the United States Bicentennial, was erected in 1974. It has since become one of Wichita's most recognized and beloved symbols. A spring/summer 2006 project elevated the sculpture on a 30-foot rock promontory so it could be seen from farther away.\nA profile image of this statue comprises the motif adopted by the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, a U.S. Air Force flying unit which is based at nearby McConnell Air Force Base. From 1993 through 2004, an image of the statue, along with the words \"Keeper of the Plains,\" appeared on the tails of Boeing KC-135 air refueling tankers assigned to the 22nd ARW.\n\n\n== In popular culture and the arts ==\nThe Keeper of the Plains was mentioned by Christian musician Rich Mullins in his 1991 song \"Calling Out Your Name\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the tallest statues in the United States\n\n\n== External links ==\nKansas State Historical Society\nMid-America All-Indian Center\nThe City of Wichita\nKeeper of the Plains photos & hours",

          "Nice statue and it looked very busy. Didn\u2019t see anything that showed the name of the river though. There were a lot of people. I wish I could have stayed to see fire bowl lit.",
          "This is a beautiful sculpture designed by Blackbear Bosin and has very unique bridges that add to the aesthetics. The base is interesting and informative and be right on the joining of the rivers makes it very special as many native american tribes camped there when they lived",
          "Walking the bridges in the afternoon was quite scenic. I wouldn\u2019t have thought of the route as very romantic, but many couples were there. We even witnessed a proposal. We came back at night to see the ring of fire which was definitely worth it.",
          "This Wichita landmark was a delight both in daylight and at night when, at sunset the ring of fire flames \ud83d\udd25 are lit. I loved the way you reach it by a footbridge and that there were lots of info on boards about local Native Americans even music playing. The statue itself is",

          "We visited this in June on a bright sunny day and it was well worth the visit to see such an iconic statue up close. Parking was easy and you just have to cross the bridge to get to it. When it is lit up at night it is quite atmospheric, we could even see it from our hotel room",
          "We were told by locals to check out the lighting ceremony done every night, weather permitting. There was places to park all over and we enjoyed taking a stroll down to the river front. The ceremony lasts about 15 minutes, just long enough to get good pictures. It\u2019s a cool free",

          "The Keeper of the Plains is very impressive overlooking the Arkansas river. However the Indian Centre nearby was a bit disappointing, I was expecting more history of the Plain Indians. What they had was interesting, featuring Bigbear Boisin\u2019s art work, and a short video. The",
          "We stopped here after our hotel suggested it to us at check in. Easy to get to, plenty of parking, nice to walk around, plaques explaining what you are seeing, and nice breeze along the river. At night they light fire below the statue for about 15 minutes. 9PM in summer and",
          "This is a pretty area and very easy to get to. The walkway bridges are perfect. The museum is not open on Monday so we were not able to visit there.",
          "This was a lovely spot to end the day. The breeze on the bridge was nice. They didn\u2019t light the rings of fire though, maybe because of the higher water levels.",
          "The rivers were high, flood levels, when we were there so you couldn't walk around on the sides but we crossed the bridges just fine. It really is a beautiful site to see.",
          "Great info about Indians who were in this area~`the story of the two rivers coming together was very interesting.",
          "Beautiful area to walk all around or ride a bike. The statue is huge and the story and artifacts surrounding it are so informative. Indian music is playing while you are there and is so calming . To stand on the bridges and look over the water while listening to the music is a",
          "We were directed by my wife's cousin to this extremely moving park. Well laid out for easy walking with plenty of parking. Beautiful background music being played. The stature in the middle of the river and the memorial to the armed forces brings out a lot of emotions.",
          "In town for business. After dinner we were looking for something else to do so we walked to this area. It was really great to see all the families out together enjoying the warm weather and visiting this monument. I wish they kept the flames burning a little longer (only 15 mins",
          "It was very interesting, we walked along the Arkansas River, they have a kids place and a place to hold events, the keeper is lite up at night by fire rings. Interesting wall history. We think it is a must see attraction.",

          "The Keeper itself is a beautiful work of art. Knowing the history of the area, it is perfectly placed, supported by additional art work. The perfect place in Wichita to experience either a sunrise or sunset !",
          "Love the sculpture, nice landmark. all the arkansas river beyond lots of geese. We like the view from there, and walk\u0131ng all around the r\u0131ver. Very peaceful place to walk. The river was very high from the rain, cover\u0131ng some of the walk\u0131ng paths.",

          "This is a nice tribute to the Indians. We visited and there were some families around the monument. Looked like some people come and sit a while. One had a radio, that was too loud. The statue is cool as is the bridge. The fire rings would be neat to see at night.",
          "I've been here twice. Love it! The water is extremely high right now, so some of the sidewalks were flooded, but the bridge was fine. Last time, a couple years ago, I watched the Keeper be lit (the torches) at dusk. I'd love to see it again! There are plaques to read as well",
          "The most enjoyment you can have is to visit at 9:00 pm each evening to see the fire pots light up and reflect into the river. The Keeper of the Plains faces East to greet the morning sun, a great way to start your day.",

          "Interesting review of Native American life. Beautiful surroundings. Very moving with nature. Flowers were beautiful.",
          "Nice to visit and to know. The place of statue is also very special. The only negative point is the statue needs more lighting in night time - for me.",
          "We expected to just hop out and take a few photos of the statue but there were actually some very interesting plaques about Native culture in the area. Watch out for the geese though, one of them nearly took out a toddler while we were there.",
          "It\u2019s fun to have a place that people gather in the evening and this provides a perfect setting and a chance to walk off dinner. The statue is impressive and is best at 9:00 pm when the fire show starts.",
          "It is a very commercial place do not go there to expect culture it's all about the Almighty dollar so don't go there to expect a friendly face it's all about the Almighty dollar",
          "Went here during the day its a great place for a walk lots of sections to see well worth a visit and noticed they had a fire show at 9pm so went back for this it didn't happen the first night possiblly due to the water being high did the 2nd night worth waiting for.",
          "I recommend taking the time to enjoy this site. It was recommended to me while talking to a customer about what to see if I ever got to Kansas. I would have liked more time and less rain to see the nearby museums as well.",
          "I visited this in the middle of the day. Not an ideal time, but it was still a great piece of art and the bridges in the area are pleasing also. I didn't know where I was going so I ended up over at the museum, but there isn't a direct path from there to the sculpture that is",

          "The Keeper of the Plains is a must-see for visitors and residents. It is free and not too time-consuming to walk across the bridge and around the area. If you plan to go to Exploration Place, Botanica, or any downtown museums, it\u2019s a perfect quick stop to enjoy this iconic",
          "Nice exhibit honoring the plains Indians. At the Base there is a nice exhibit and Indian sounds are playing. It is located where the Little Arkansas and Arkansas Rivers merge and there\u2019s a walkway on both sides of the river. It\u2019s most impressive when they light the fires around",
          "Unsure what was going to happen. The fire around the statute light up for about 15 minutes and then go out. No talking or information just walk around and read the plaques.",
          "This was a neat stop in Wichita but there wasn't much there. Unfortunately we didn't see the Ring of Fire that is done after dark so I would say a during the day visit is just average.",
          "Very nice trail along the river for easy access to the suspension bridge. Short walk to enjoy the sculpture. Even saw a heron in the water. Since the walk is along the river, it can be very windy at times.",

          "The Keeper is one of the major landmarks of Wichita, and for good reason. The statue design is creative and instantly recognizable. The additions of the bridge, walking paths, and informational area have made it even better. My favorite is when they light the fire pits",

          "We are new to Wichita and had heard that we had to see this Wichita landmark. It was a beautiful view as we walked along the river from the Exploration Museum to the pedestrian walkway that crosses the river to the Keeper of the Plains statue. Walked around the statue and",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the keeper of the plains statue right at the point where the Arkansas River in a little Arkansas River meet easy access easy walking wheelchair access as well",
          "The statue is amazing. Theres walking paths around, down to the river. I learned some great info from the multiple displays. And there is so many other fun things to do in the park. The rocky pathway and lush landscaping made a great spot for family photos!",
          "Everytime time that I have the opportunity to go to Wichita I love to go here. It's so beautiful with a nice bridge and a long riverside walkway.",
          "We walked the bridge to The Keeper of the Plains. It had very interesting facts about the Indians. It is very cool how The Keeper is looking out over the water. Families and couples both were enjoying the area.",
          "This is a wonderful spot on the river where the Indian history is explained. The views are awesome as you walk around.",
          "Erected at the junction of two rivers next to the Indian center is visited daily by many, and the centerpiece of many photographs.",
          "We went to see the Keeper of the Plains, it's a beautiful place , very clean and the paths are winding and made for a wonderful afternoon. My only thing is we saw the Keeper in the day and won't be back to see him in his glory at night. I am sure it fantastic. We also found",
          "This is a magnificent statue set of the point where the Arkansas River and Little Arkansas River meet. Tips: 1. The meeting of these two rivers is actually considered sacred land in some native beliefs, so have a blast but try to be respectful. 2. The \"Ring Of Fire\" (exactly",
          "I think the city has done an excellent, excellent job with the walking paths along the river and the bridges connecting the keeper to both sides. The Keeper is cool but a bit underwhelming after having heard about it from some locals.",
          "The statue is a permanent etched in my memories, but this time I was able to walk around and see the displays around the base of the stature. It adds so much to the statue itself. We'll have to go back again one day to see the flames lit around the base.",
          "We went there to walk around downtown, see the ducks and view the sculpture. We stayed until the flames were lit. It was spectacular. Well worth the wait for nightfall.",
          "It was a hot day, but my boyfriend decided to take me here and I was speechless. The statue really speaks to you about the history and the pride of Wichita and the Plains! Highly recommend going to see it and the \"arrow\" bridge!",
          "Excellent place to visit. Recommend around 9pm when fire is on. Good view of the city. Pice place to take family pictures.",
          "On vacation trip to Rocky Mtn. National park staying in Wichita. On looking for things to see along the way, this one we found on Trip Adviser. Went to the site in early evening but would have liked to seen it lit up. Enjoyed reading about the Plains Indians, the different",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is one of the most if not the most iconic piece of art in Wichita that people know about. It is a must see. But did you know that inside the Drury hotel, (Douglass and Waco) is in my opinion Wichita's best kept secret. Blackbear Bosin spent several",
          "Keeper of the plains is an awesome place to for for a variety of activities. Going for a late nite stroll, power walking, sitting and enjoying the river or the views, watching the rings of fire that are lit nightly, a bike ride or maybe to sit ans wstch the fire works on",
          "Very nice scenery we took our family pictures down here twice. The first time in the winter when the fires were lit. And we came back for summer photos!",
          "If you haven\u2019t seen the Keeper statue in years, or even if you have - but want to do something different to fill an evening, I strongly suggest a trip to downtown. With the renovation a few years ago, they created a wonderful area and raised the statue dramatically from its old",
          "Visit the Keeper of the Plains statue and park. It's a great family outing. The statue is where the Arkansas River and Little Arkansas River meet. On the grounds there are many Native American displays and a museum. The museum was closed the day we went. The area is just",
          "I guessed I missed the boat on this one. It could be seen from our hotel but I probably would not walk around as it was not in the best area of town-downtown and yes, it is a large sculpture but if you are planning a trip based solely on this -don't do it! I love large",
          "Such a beautiful piece of artwork given by the Indians to the city of Wichita. Well worth stopping by to read the history.",
          "Beautiful place to spend some time while in Witchita. Run, walk or just take pictures; solo or with family, it is a beautiful place to be.",
          "While in town visiting family we took a afternoon to explore some of Wichita\u2019s must see sites. I would put the Keeper of the Plains at the top of that list. It\u2019s educational and quite beautiful to see. The walk across the bridge is scenic in itself but the statue itself is quite",
          "Great place to visit... peaceful location and powerful monument! Easily accessible from parking lot... Would love to visit again.",
          "This is so worth the time to see. You can take a few minutes to a hour, depending how much you have. Easy parking and access via bridges. Great for all ages and impressive.",
          "I liked seeing the Keeper, but I enjoyed the surrounding monument and the Indian center just as much. It's along the river trail, just a short and pleasant walk from downtown Wichita.",
          "Nice to visit during the lighting of the fires only lasts about 15 min Do not lock your valuables in the car !!!",
          "Go at night when the Keeper's fires are lit. It is incredible. Young and old enjoy this visit. Very ADA friendly.",
          "Nice place to visit if your on the bike path on the river, lots of things to see stop and check out the new library at night they light the flames,",
          "We only had time for a quick walk to visit. Definitely worth going when they light the bonfires @ 9:00.",
          "We went in the afternoon and then again at 9PM in order to see the Keeper with the fires lit. The riverwalk itself is open, beautiful, and inviting. There are waterfowl but we didn't see any altercations with them. You can see it for a distance but of course it's even better",
          "For 15 years I lived in the Wichita area and had never seen the Keeper. One evening my wife dragged me the short drive to see our City's symbol lit up. The Statue is huge; sits on a rock island in the middle of the two Arkansas River fors that meet at the site. A suspended",
          "They have done a brilliant job of developing the area around the Keeper and have made it more than just an opportunity to see the statue. The river walk is also very nice and picturesque. The only downside was the constant approaches from pan handlers wanting money for gas,",
          "We stopped a the Keeper of Plains on our way to Wichita's Old Cow Town. We parked and walked across a bridge to the monument. Took a few pictures and read some of the signage. We spent a total of about 25 minutes in the area. The monument is impressive. The area around",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a magnificent monument that is beautifully contrasted by a white pedestrian bridge. A must see and a photographer's delight!",
          "Nicely designed riverfront path to lead down to the monument made for a pleasing after dinner walk. Friendly folks down the path on a summer night.",
          "Walked along the river to get here. You can see the Native American statue from a distance. When you walk across onto the monument across the river you have great views of Wichita, the river, and a waterfall. The monument has a rich history and panels of reading. Taking it",
          "I love public art, and the Keeper is a special expression of what Wichita is all about. The site of the statue is a beautiful spot and if you're going to visit it you need to go at sundown so that you can watch the torches surrounding the Keeper get lit.",
          "This was a beautiful place to visit. The feeling this place has is calm and soothing. My only disappointment was garbage left thrown all over by others. However, this is not a big enough deterrent to say one shouldn't go. There was a young man softly playing guitar and singing",
          "The river, bridge and statue was nicely balanced and beautiful. The surprise was the Plains Indian display at the island where the two bridges meet.",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a nice sculpture and symbol of Wichita and Kansas pride. While attractive, there is not much else to see and do beyond the statue and the view of Wichita from along the Arkansas /ruver-bank.",
          "Very nice park and statue. We really enjoyed seeing it. We did not come back for the Ring of Fire ceremony, although if we had had time we would have.",
          "Went during the day today, then came back for the fires. Nice area to walk around. Lots of ducks in the river. Pretty spot!",
          "Peaceful river walk- museums, mini golf & exploratorium. Great sunset spot across from downtown. Pets welcome.",
          "I had seen the statue from a distance many, many times so it was nice to be there at dusk when the fire was lit around the base of the statue. The entire family enjoyed it.",
          "All 20 people were bored. Definitely not a tourist attraction. Dairy Queen is more fun and exciting.",
          "This was fun too see. The ring of fire was really pretty go before dark and see the veterans park it is great to.",
          "Make sure you get there in time for the lighting of the flames! This is a Wichita must see, if you live here go take your dogs and check it out!",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a beautiful 44-foot tall steel sculpture standing at the point where the Big and Little Arkansas rivers join together in downtown Wichita. This land between the two rivers is sacred ground to the Native American people and is also home to the",
          "While in Wichita visiting my son we decided to check out the Native American cultural experience. Keeper of the Plains did not disappoint it is rich in history and culture. I highly recommend catching it at night when they light the ring of Fire.",
          "As a piece of art, The Keeper stands as a simple monument to all Native Americans of the area, but particularly the Wichita and Kansa tribes. To me, the beauty of the Keeper lies in its simple shapes and lack of detail. I\"m not sure where this $11 fee some have mentioned",
          "Nice place by the river fires are fun in the evening lots of people usually nice weather you have the Riverwalk well lighted very good place to hang out Wichita doesn't have a lot of nice hangout places and this is probably the premier one great safe location in the Riverside",
          "In general a nice attraction, can all be done in 10 min. Wanted to know more of Native Americans in the area.",
          "We saw the lighting of the flames on a quick evening walks which was very cool. I was glad we had a bit of time on our trip for this excursion Peaking into grounds of museum made me wish for more time to explore",
          "I always enjoy visiting the Keeper of the Plains. The historic aspect is nice and it it a beautiful, peaceful place.",
          "Wichita's Keeper of the Plains is a tribute to the Native population in general. Besides the statute, there is a memorial plaque featuring a turtle. This, plus the beat of the drum playing quietly throughout this memorial area, transports a visitor to a place of the past.",
          "This is a wonderful monument to see. Has a lot of history about the Plains Indians and about the artist Blackbear Bosin. Highly recommend.",
          "Walking trails surround the Keeper of the Plains and the river in this area. Lots of other interesting artwork and views along the walking paths. Close to other area attractions. Beautifully lit at night. Makes for great photo opportunities.",
          "We went to this site expecting to waste 20 minutes and look at a statue. What we found was a cool and educational spot! This artwork is beautifully mounted at a gorgeous location on the river. They've provided a rear entrance into the Indian Center, which a convenience I was",
          "Keeper of the Plains sits in a great spot for photos of Downtown Wichita. Also very close to Riverside Park & Cow town. Art museum is within a short distance and so is Exploration Place. Keeper of the Plains is great during the day or evening hours. Its a different experience",
          "Took a long walk along the Arkansas river and ended up at the keeper. Lots of cool things to see along the way. The keeper is a very powerful art piece and privides several awesome photo opportunities. Would be a cool place to get married....",
          "was in Wichita for weekend sightseeing and wanted to see the Keeper and native American museum. very nice. enjoyed walking along the rivers and seeing the Keeper. grounds well kept, neat and cleaned. plenty of parking. if in area do stop by well worth it",
          "Pleasant location at the confluence of two rivers with the skyline in the background. Enjoyed reading the plaques with the history of the area. Dusk is a good time to visit.",
          "This is a really cool site to see. At night it is lite up and looks really pretty as well. I wouldn't advise going alone.",
          "This sculpture is easy to get to and free public parking is just steps away. Take the time to read the various information plaques. And wander around. The sculpture is located on a small island with a bridge from each of the riverbanks. At night gas flames highlight the",
          "This is a great spot for pictures and sightseeing. Near by is Indian Museum to compliment this sight. Great for learning Indian culture and traditions.",
          "The keeper of the plains when encluded with a walk around the area is a great thing to entertain for no cost. Be sure to visit the Troll under the grate on the North side of the little River and be there for the lighting of the fire post after 8 pm. Low River or high river",
          "Very educational. Learn a lot about American Indian teachings and traditions. If you visit at dusk you will be able to experience the Ring of Fire. Very worthwhile.",
          "The Keeper of the Plains Statue is a Wichita treasure! The fire-pits go on every evening in the summer after sundown. It is fun to walk across the bridge, see the Native American displays and watch the fire pits go on. It is a fun 30 minute activity with out of town guests!",
          "We went on a Tuesday morning about 9 a.m. It was a great time to enjoy the display without crowds. The sculpture is beautiful, and the information was just enough to satisfy us on a short visit. I was a little disappointed in the condition of the grass which evidently is not",
          "I go down to here all the time with my parrot she loves meeting new people and the view is great. Everyone should visit at least once.",
          "Being in Wichita for a wedding, there wasn\u2019t much to do with a teenager in tow. Visiting this was very cool and was given the thumbs up by said teenager. We enjoyed the fire but we also enjoyed walking around the water and enjoying the views.",
          "I am so pleased that we stopped to the Keeper of the Plains. The suspension bridge, baby geese, Plains Indian history lesson, and the beauty of the statue were quite unexpected. This is a worthy stop for viewing, photos, exercise, and fresh air. It is also beautifully lit at",
          "A very well done sculpture that is lit up very nicely at night. Been a good symbol of sorts for the city of Wichita.",
          "This was high on my \"must to\" list for a recent trip to Wichita. I didn't really know what to expect, but I must say it was OUTSTANDING. Apparently there are some fire pots that are lit at 9pm each evening when weather permits. That must be amazing! It is beautifully",
          "A lot of teens hang out here at night. i would only go during the day or sunset to see the ring light up. they have great bike trails here.",
          "I remember when this piece of work was erected around the mid 70's. It is to me, a reminder of our native heritage and the Indians who were the original inhabitants of the the beautiful Plains area. I believe the creator was Native American. It has been relocated and is",
          "This is a park, river walk, museum and history of the Indians that once roamed the area. The statue of the Indian upon a big bolder was impressive. The walk around the two rivers was pleasant and pretty, lots of trees",
          "I love Wichita. I never have enough time to see everything, but keep trying. A friend recommended that I see The Keeper of the Plains exhibit and area. How beautiful and historic! It's located on the river and there is something for the entire family to enjoy! I wish I had",
          "Nice historical display and interesting monument in the beautiful downtown river area of Wichita. Definitely a unique place to visit.",
          "We went here after looking at a display at Riverside Park after seeing a crowd gather. It was fun to see something in person that I've only see in photos. The fire display is below the sculpture, not around the base like I thought. Between the bridge and sculpture there is a",
          "This is such a beautiful park, right on the river, the sculpture stands guard over the river and it\u2019s beautiful! Lots of geese and ducks to watch in the river, and birds singing in the trees. A very serene place to visit early in the morning!",
          "It is a must see thing and there is something to learn about Indians here. Plan to spend 10 min here. Good. You might want to expand the learning in the Indian Museum right there. Wrong. There is a ugly locked gate. The Keepers plaza and the Museum have different owners",
          "Where else is there this big of river going through the city? Peaceful, scenic and fresh air. Their is music playing and plenty of people visiting so you feel safe.",
          "This is a very impressive monument, the information on nearby metal plates very helpful. At the base of the monument the usual suspects just throw away their rubbish and empty bottles, one rubbish bin might give these idiots a clue.",
          "We are here weekly. The grounds are kept excellently and there are always a lot of people enjoying the area. If you haven't been here - put this place on your list.",
          "I missed the fire lighting thing but they didn't really advertise when they do it. I would be nice on a summer evening with a walk with the family or loved one. It isn't special and there aren't a lot of parking spaces.",
          "Very impressive, especially at night while the fire is on. you can take a small tour around the gardens.",

          "We had been driving from Minneapolis to Oklahoma City and wanted a nice place to get out and stretch. Very easy walk and well-maintained - beautiful evening and nice sight. It is spring- no restrooms I could see and not really any picnic tables, so we put a blanket down-",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a beautifully done Indian statue with artistically detailed blowing fringe. The parking was unclear which first had us making a stop at fenced off Indian museum. We returned to our cars and drove only a short distance to another parking spot which",
          "This is a beautiful lighted night time delight. The Keeper of the Plains is well light and visible for a distance. There are paved sidewalks along the river where the Keeper of the Plains overlooks. There are beautiful bridges to the small island that hosts the Keeper of the",
          "My daughter lives close by so when my brother came for a visit from out of town we went for the fire show. I have lived here for over 40 years and never ventured there to see at night. Very impressive, beautiful walk across the bridge and even got to see the \u201cTroll\u201d. It\u2019s a must",

          "I go there occasionally because it is one of the few places that I can walk 3+ miles without getting bored. There's frequently ducks and geese on the river passing by it and occasionally you'll see a boat on the water. The keeper itself is a beautiful statue standing proudly to",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is one of the most unique things about Wichita. I would highly recommend visiting for the evening fire display. The display lights up the river to the delight of all in attendance.",
          "We were visiting our daughter and needed to stretch our legs outside, so we chose to visit the Keeper of the Plains. I had seen it on TV before but never in person. Such an amazing piece to see, and great walking paths down town Wichita.",
          "There\u2019s so much interesting history associated with this great city and much of it is staged wonderfully, but none better than this. The essence is that it captures \u201chow it all got started, what brought us here, and why we stayed. Must visit! Easy walking tours.",
          "Bored one nice day. Decided to go walk. What a fun nice day to walk around during the afternoon. What s beautiful site to behold.",
          "The Keeper of the Plains statue is the symbol of Wichita. He was made by the famous Wichita Native American Artist, Black Bear Bosin. He stands at the convergence of the Arkansas River and the Little Arkansas River. The Mid America All Indian Center is the gateway to the statue.",
          "This is a Wichita landmark, so we bring visiting friends here to see the fire light up. The daytime view is very different than at night. It's best to go a little before dark, go eat or something, and then come back after dark. The only thing I don't like about it is the signs",
          "The walk up to the sculpture is very enjoyable and the sight when you get to the sculpture itself is breathtaking. Take a little bit and visit this gem in Wichita!!!",
          "An impressive sight, standing 44 feet high at the joining of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers is a steel sculpture by Blackbear Bosin, a Kiowa-Comanche artist. Multiple displays adorn the base of the statue describing the local tribes previously living in the area. Also",

          "This is a great exhibit, especially if you are there at nightfall and you can witness the fires burning around this unusual statue of The Keeper of the Plains by Black Bear Bosin. The exhibit part of this is well done and gives great and interesting information. The bridge is",

          "Amazing! It was a beautiful walk across the stunning bridge to see. Important to note that there didn't seem to be any public restrooms close by. Also, please be careful what time of the day you go by yourself. This is a public place outdoors frequented by other tourist, and",
          "Very nice area. Went at night and it looked really cool. The bridges are also pretty cool to walk across.",

          "It is a very nice park and monument. It is a nice place to visit, but not something you would come back for.",
          "You have to see the fire at night. It's a beautiful sight during the day. Family friendly. If you walk on the north slide of the river, behind the steel grates behind the power station you will find the TROLL!",

          "This is a great place to take a walk and enjoy the area. We were having a family reunion at a local hotel the second weekend of November. A few of us walked over on a Friday evening to see the lighting of the fire pots. The walk way to the site was well lit and well-maintained.",
          "We had a wonderful time around the keeper of the plains, From the scenery to the layout. Little nifty facts you can read along the way. Be sure to look for the troll under the bridge and go check it out at night, when they do they fire lighting. Make sure to bring a camera as",
          "Beautiful place to visit any time of the year. We took our pre teen grandchildren there to see tbe Keeper and waited until 9:00 pm when burts of fire seamingly come out of the water. A wonderful place to find a place to sit and relax on your own also.",

          "This was a great pit stop for us to learn some history. Very lovely layout and architecture. Really very nice.",
          "What a great gathering point for visitors to downtown Wichita. Two large spanning bridges not only lead you to the site, but add to the beauty of the place. The statute some how captures both a modern and traditional perspective. They have many very large boulders there,",

          "After lunch at The Anchor and shopping at the Spice Merchant, we took the short drive to The Water Walk. Great photo ops. Museum quality design. History of the two rivers. A nice walk or sit in your vehicle, in the Exploration Place parking lot. Return for the nightly show at",

          "Awesome site to see, beautiful bridge on both sides leading to the statue. Went during the day but bet it would be awesome to see at night.",
          "A great place to take a break and relax on the river. The statute is impressive to look at and we would recommend going at night when the flames are lit at 9PM. Parking around the Keeper is free.",
          "We live in Wichita so whenever we have an out of state visitors we take them there as it's a Wichita icon. It's free, and good view of downtown and as with other reviews stay for the flames (be sure to check schedule first as they sometimes are out for service). Free parking on",
          "It starts with a beautiful bridge to walk across from either side of the river. Then a little history lesson about the previous land owners. Next is a statue that towers above you. The Keeper of the Plains! If you come at the right time you can witness the ring of fire display",
          "This was an after dinner afterthought that my friends too me to...it's a beautiful scene along the Arkansas River and when the Flames are lit at 9pm (15 minutes only), the place comes alive with pedestrians and their wide assortment of Pups..there were minstrels playing, people",
          "This Wichita landmark is placed at the confluence of two rivers, the Big and Little Arkansas. The sculpture by Wichita artist Black Bear Bosin is iconic, and the surrounding park area has Native American narrative exhibits, primarily about the tribes living on the surrounding",
          "A must see when your in Wichita! Take advantage of the beautiful walk way from one side of the river to the other. Stay and watch the fire rings that illuminates this great piece of art work.",
          "Black Bear Bosin designed and made the statue before his death. It is really a tribute to the Indian people. The Indian Musuem is well worth touring and they put on excellent programs.",
          "A must see in Wichita!A gorgeous statue.A tribute to our Native Americans who actually new how to honor our land.",
          "We were just driving by on our way out of town and had to stop. The parking was easy. The paths nice and wide and accessible for people with walking challenges or wheelchairs. No services though- I din't see restrooms or water fountains. No place to buy drinks/ice creams",
          "We love to take a stroll around the keeper of the plains. During the day, the walk along the river is pleasant and is great for runners and bikes. The fire show at night is charming.",
          "I don't think there used to be a trail to Keeper of the Plains when I lived in Wichita. Beautiful trail area and very inspiring to be upclose to this iconic Wichita statue",
          "The Keeper of the Plains \u201cRing of Fire\u201d will burn the following schedule during the months of Daylight Savings Time (spring and summer: Nightly: 9 PM for 15 minutes. During standard time (fall and winter): 7 PM for 15 minutes.",
          "Would have preferred to see the bonfires around it lit at night, but very impressive by daytime as well",
          "It is a great place to start a evening walk with a friend or family. Share in the Wichita culture and enjoy the different vistas provided. Each point presented unique photo opportunities. Then you can find spots to sit and take it all in or take a nice long walk along the",
          "Take a relaxing stroll around the area during the comfortable part of the day. Great place for photographs.",
          "Impressive piece, with good information posted around it. It's a very nice walk along the river and the history of the area is well described along the way. The lighting up of it in the evenings is well worth a look.",
          "Nice to visit and learn about the culture of Wichita. Lighting of the torch is neat to watch. Neat architecture.",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is pretty awe-inspiring all by itself, but add the 9pm Ring of Fire and WOW! So grateful to Blackbear Bosin for his creativity that reminds us daily of the Native American heritage of this land.",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a beautiful sculpture with a nod to the Native people's of the area. It is located at the confluence of two rivers, which is dramatic. In the evening, huge cauldrons are lit with fire. The river is flanked with a walkway from which you can view the",
          "take time to visit the many attractions in Wichita. this was one of the cleanest cities with lots of attractions. the keeper of the plains.old cowtown museum,exploration place,old town and Kansas river trail. didn't have time to see everything. wiil return",
          "This is a beautiful tribute! We wish the lighting would last a little longer. Worth seeing both during the day and at night.",
          "We were able to follow signs in downtown Wichita to find this wonderful statue. My elderly Mother wanted to see it. It was so hot outside along with mobility issues, I was able to drive to the parking lot on the NW side of the statue. We saw it and it was majestic-all of Wichita",
          "This is right on the river where they meet and it is neat to watch them light the fires at night and fun to walk over the bridge to the Keeper. Good people watching and a good way to see downtown by the river.",
          "Beautiful (free!) place to visit with a futuristic looking pedestrian bridge and a Native American sculpture paying tribute to the area's past where the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers join. If you're here at dusk, you might just catch the ring of fire presentation.",
          "This is a lovely park with this awesome statue. Really good photo opportunities around the park. The walkways are very nice along the river. It was disheartening that people would throw their plastic bottles into the river around the statue when there are trash bins everywhere!",
          "Good place to come to hang out with friends. Very relaxing. Torches are very pretty for sure after dark.",
          "The city of Wichita has done some amazing improvements to this historic place. Go at night to see the fire canons shoot out flames. Beautiful statue....fun pedestrian bridge over the river.",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a must see in Wichita. It is a magnificent piece of art. It is beautiful during the day but at night when the fire pots are lit it is exceptional.",
          "Whether your live in Wichita or are just passing through this is a must see attraction. I would recommend going during the daytime and at night to get the full impact of the artwork.",
          "We arrived in the late evening, saw a lovely sunset from the pedestrian bridge and watched the fires come to life around the bottom of the Keeper Statue. As the evening light lessened the indian statue lighting was spectacular. We were told to look for the troll hidden",
          "The grand Keeper of the Plains is located at the intersection of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas River. It's a nice bridge to stroll over. Wichita is hot, but it's a dry heat. I didn't mind it. It might be a good idea to come in the evening and around 9 pm if possible.",
          "We love taking our family to the Keeper, there's a lot of neat displays also that have information about the culture of the Native American tribes in the Wichita area. You have to stay to see the flame light up!",
          "This is a beautiful location for a stroll along the river. In the evening the fire pots burn during certain times. People gather, ride their bikes, look for the troll, watch the wildlife and if you plan right the beautiful sunset.",
          "Tip: Go in the daytime and come back at 9pm for the lighting of the cauldrons. There's no real ceremony but its so beautiful. Better view from parking lot across from it for the lighting. Its amazing.",
          "This is a nice place to walk and enjoy the view. There is information about the Plains Indians that I found interesting. Next time I want to go at night (9:00 in summer) and see the statue with the fire around it.",
          "It was a hot afternoon as we walked over to see the Keeper, but we enjoyed this beautiful tribute to the Native Americans. The bridge area is lovely, the information boards helpful & educational and the site itself is well done and memorable.",
          "The Keeper is not really something that you \"do\", so it being in this category may be a bit misleading. That being said, it IS a lovely thing to go see. It's a pretty little area to go for a walk. There is parking on either side of the Keeper, and it's a short walk over a bridge",
          "This is a very good stop if you are in Wichita Area. I gives insight into the culture in Wichita and Kansas. It is a great view of the Wichita skyline and the river and you can enjoy a peaceful walk along the Arkansas River. The other best part is that it is free.",
          "Took out of state relatives to see Keeper after visiting the Veterans Memorial Park. They were impressed with the quality of the information provided and the cleanliness of the area. I think locals probably do not take the time to enjoy this unique area and the surrounding",
          "When the sun is getting ready to go down and cooling off some this is a beautiful spot to stand and look and listen to the water going by and looking out over the city. It's a hidden treasure for Wichita Kansas.",
          "While visiting my sister in Wichita, we had to go and see this landmark! It was really cool to walk around and read the information on the landmark. We went as the sun was going down and the sun reflecting off was so beautiful. We didn't make it there at night but I heard that",
          "This is a good free thing to see in Wichita. On evenings if the weather is good, they light fires around it. It's an icon, and you will see miniature versions of it around town. There are some historical details, and it is stroller accessible.",
          "Was Mother's day get together. Seeing the sites of Witcha Kansas This is very beautiful, moving and informative. A must see for tourists. A good place for a picnic too",
          "We loved the whole area. It was beautiful to walk around and so many people come down in the evening to see the flames around the Keeper and yet it is still so peaceful. We were in Wichita for 4 nights and spent 3 walking around the Keeper of the Plains, the Veterans Memorial",
          "This is one of the places I always bring visitors to the city. It's the official symbol of Wichita, so you absolutely must get a picture here. Also, the walk around and over the river is lovely.",
          "Before visiting the Keeper, my [unfair] impression was this was going to be some hokey, artificial-feeling site: \"We thought we needed another site to give our city more legitimacy with tourists, so we funded this project. We needed a symbol to put in the tourist",
          "Just the fact that this place is highly rated tells us that Wichita (and Kansas) is a somewhat boring place to visit. This particular attraction is worth a good 10-minute leg stretch but that's about it.",
          "Visited the Keeper of the Plains and it was much bigger than I expected. I liked the 2 bridges that are on both sides. Very safe area, people were jogging and fishing. Got some good photos but that's about all you can do at this site",
          "Very neat historic place to visit. We happened to be just in time for the fire lighting at 9pm on a summer Friday night, so we walked all they way down and around to see it from the front. This is just a neat thing to see while you're here, there are people all over the park,",
          "When the weather is nice it's a great area to walk around. Not a whole lot to do at the statute but it is cool looking.",
          "Good for families,guy playing music no restrooms,some history on walls long bridge,side walk near water for bikes or walking jogging",
          "The Keeper of the Plains statue is a tribute to the Native American heritage and history. Located right on the river, it is easy to reach and located close to the museums and attractions in the area. Definitely worth the time to get a good look at the beautiful surroundings",
          "The Keeper of the Plains history and location is beautiful. The ring of fire is a unique experience and one for everybody. The whole river district is a sight!",
          "The bridge and statue are worth visiting if the have a few free minutes. The attraction is right on the river so you can take a walk after viewing the statue and native american displays. Located not too far from the baseball stadium so you could take a walk to/from after",
          "It is and always has been a feeling of grace and gratitude in the place where the Keeper resides. I'm drawn to her every time I'm in the area",
          "Take a few minutes of your trip to Wichita and see this great statue and see some local Native American displays right on the Arkansas River. They even have cerimonial drums playing while you visit.",
          "Is a nice and beautiful place for walk. At night they turn on the torch manually. The sculpture is standing at the point where the little and big Arkansas rivers join.",
          "This is an amazing display of the American Indian. This is the Keeper of the Plains. There is a wonderful walking path and breath taking photo opportunities everywhere. The bridge is a well designed marvel that is something of beauty. The statue stands at the point where the",
          "Enjoyed the river walk and the little island the statue is on when we stayed overnight in Wichita. A Lovely spot.",
          "Besides the statue which stands at the point where the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers merge, there is a lovely tribute to the Native Americans. This stop is so worthwhile.",
          "I've been here twice and it's always my go to place for a nice walk and some peaceful time by the water. The history is and display is set up for a nice walk through. It is a must see if your visiting Wichita.",
          "Every time we're in Wichita we make a point to drive by this wonderful reminder of Wichita's Native American heritage. If I remember the history of this attraction it is just a model of what was recommended to rival the arch in St. Louis. At the time the much, much larger",
          "The view of the river from the island is amazing, but it's pretty dangerous with young children. There were kids climbing all over the rocks. There was a (loud) family right in the center selling candy/drinks/trinkets - which I thought was a little obtrusive. There is an",
          "We went during the day and really enjoyed our walk along the water and the beautiful statue. Went back around 8:30 to be there for the lighting of the flames. The two bridges, ducks, river and people watching all added to the enjoyment.",
          "We arrived about 8:30 and enjoyed the pleasant walk along the Arkansas River. It was nice to see other people also enjoying the May evening in the heart of Wichita. The flames around the sculpture lit up at 9:00 and was a beautiful sight and made the view unique. I would",
          "There are some good bike/running trails here that are paved and run along the river. Also make sure to check out the fire that lights up in the evenings. It's a really good experience to go to.",
          "This beautiful area is a lovely area for a walk or just stand on the bridge and watch the water flow by. At night the gas lights bring a beautiful light to the area and make for beautiful photos. During the day many runners make this area part of the daily work out, friendly",
          "It's a great place to come see, especially in the early evening as the sun sets. When the darkness falls, the gas lights and then you get to see the torches light up. Great views and very relaxing. I visited earlier, but the date selection did not allow the earlier dates. More",
          "Impressive statue in a nice setting. Free parking and easy access to get up close. Lot's of nice angles for good pictures.",
          "The park is good for walking on a sunny day, nice views and quiet atmosphere to relax, the only bad, no baths nearby, this can be a problem, site recommended.",
          "Stop by and view the Keeper of the Plains. There is a small park in which you can park your car or either walk using one of the corresponding trails to enter. They have fires at night. During the day you can watch the river.",
          "A nice place to go for a walk in the evening, or to just sit and people watch. Or if you're still playing Pok\u00e9mon go.. catch creatures. Can also read the information wall for a little history and information. Overall, just a nice place to be outdoors on a nice day or evening!",
          "I have lived in Wichita for 30 plus years, and if you see anything \"Wichita\", you see The Keeper of the Plains on it! I am ashamed to admit that it was not until my wife and I's 19th Anniversary that we walked there in person!!!!!!!!!! This is something you must see in person,",
          "The city has done such a great job of protecting this treasure. They've built walking paths and bridges around it to make it accessible. It sits at the convergence of two rivers and Native Americans believed the area had a spiritual significance. Plan to spend at least an hour",
          "The improvements made here over the last several years have made The Keeper very attractive. If you are visiting any other sights in the area, take a little time to check this out, too. Beautiful at night with the fire pots going, but don't dally, they only go for 15 minutes.",
          "Took our out of town guest to see the night lighting of the fire pots and show off our land mark. Show them and tell them about the Keeper and why we choose it to be the symbol of our local group.",
          "This sculpture is beautifully displayed. It is well worth the effort to see him. I read it is the most photographed spot in Wichita. I believe it. It is set at the convergence of two rivers. The area is beautiful. A nice little walk. Don't miss it.",
          "Visited here on a Monday. Too bad, because the museum building is closed on Mondays (like most of the museums in Wichita are) That's the only reason for the 4 stars. The bridge that leads to the main area (and the statue shown) is very cool. A parking lot on either end of the",

          "we went on a sunny day, the site was very interesting. Haven't seen the lights on at night yet, but will do that next time. Worth the visit if you are in the area.",
          "Love the scale and the location on the river. Great at night too. Lot's of additional info around the base. The bridge crossing the river to reach it is worth seeing alone.",
          "Great place, rich in history. Very impressive statue, very serene on the river and beautiful walking bridge.",
          "This is a huge park with a paved walk way around the entire area. There are multiple places to cross over the river. There is a must see show at dusk. This is a great way to spend sometime outside, walking and enjoying the beautiful weather!",
          "Definitely worth the visit. It rained while I was in town but when the weather is decent they light small fires around it. Good information for the kiddos or anyone that likes historical facts.",

          "The Keeper of the Plains is a nice place to go when you just want to get out and get some fresh air or take out of town visitors to a scenic spot. It's located on the Arkansas River very close to Exploration Place, the Native American Center, Botanical ,and the Art Museum.",
          "The river and statue are memorable but in the early spring late winter the wind and chill made this visit quick and a little unpleasant- in warmer weather you should go in the evening when they light the ring of fire around the warrior. It's always annoying as a woman, to find",
          "Went to see the fire show the day after the time changed, early spring. Found out it was going to go off at 9 instead of 7 which gave us enough time to go eat a great meal, it was really pretty! Hope they never stop lighting the fire!!!!",
          "The Keeper of the Plains is a Wichita Landmark. It is lit up every evening and a wonderful area for a stroll along the river. There are paved river trails for walking along the river as well",
          "Whenever we have family visit, we take them to see the fire keeper. (And the troll, which is nearby). It's fun to spend a little time outside especially if the weather is nice. My kids love it & love to see all the people who come hang out while awaiting the lighting.",
          "This is a place to see! The picture taking at Sunset is stunning! There is a little hidden \"gremlin\" below the sidewalk if you take a stroll down the sidewalk and there are beautiful memorials to fallen hero's along the path. The suspension bridge is gorgeous and the Keeper",
          "This was a nice area with something neat to see. It's pretty at night and during the day. Walk along the river over the suspension bridges to see the Veteran's park which is also very nice.",

          "The Keeper of the Plains is one of the most iconic symbols of Wichita. It is located at the confluence of the big and little Arkansas rivers. You can park in the parking lot of Exploration Place and walk over the bridge. I highly recommend visiting in the evening, there",

          "At the confluence of Wichita's river. This outdoor site is gorgeous by night. Get there 20-30 minutes early and walk the pathways and find a spot on the bridge for the lighting (nightly at nine). If you take one photo in Wichita, make it of The Keeper. The story is on stone",

          "Very interesting, amazing statue and historic site, loaded with information and things you just wouldn't have known",
          "Reading the placard, very neat set up. Looks like a great spot to take advantage of with exercise, dogs, and social gatherings/music for the summer. Liked where the keeper is placed at between the two rivers. Piece of art. Only thing is they should light it up in the fire pits",

          "My friend took my to the Keeper of the Plains and we spent at least an hour in the vicinity of the statue. The experience was very spiritual and peaceful. The visitors there were very respectful of the area and I was taken with the calm and serenity that I felt. The statue",
          "Wichita has done a nice job developing this area - have a walk along the river, explore the little park area and stop by in the evening to catch it when they light it up with fire. Overall just a nice experience.",
          "I was in town on business and I went to the American Indian Meseum that's in that area, and out of the back there's a trail which leads to this. This was the best part of it, experience-wise, it's a lot larger and more beautiful up close than in any image I saw reading about",
          "When the weather cooperates it's a spiritual lift to take a walk along the Arkansas River and work your way to Black Bear Bosin's statue and the wonderful bridge that frames it. If it's a little cold, come at night for the flames. It's a special place. Don't miss it.",
          "This is a wonderful tribute to the Native American people. The beautiful setting is at the meeting of two rivers. The small plaza has some interesting displays featuring info about Native American culture and of course the statue is beautiful. At 7pm in the wintertime they will",

          "The Keeper of the Plains is a monument to the Plains Indians who used to occupy a large area west and north of Wichita. It's beautiful and poignant at the same time. If you're staying at the Drury Plaza Hotel, the monument is a half-mile walk on the river walk. Along the way",

          "I was taken by a colleague during the day and enjoyed reading about the N American Indian history in the area. The statue is impressive but slightly dwarfed by the bridges on either side. Nonetheless worth seeing, and the war memorials are nearby too and also worth a trip. I",
          "Set on the convergence of the Little and Big Arkansas River, Keeper is an excellent short stroll with good scenery and some excellent information on local native tribes. An evening visit includes some flames to help make it that much more impressive. The nice thing is that",

Originally it had four gardens and now encompasses 17.6 acres (7.12 hectares) of botanical gardens located at 701 North Amidon, Wichita, Kansas, USA. They are city-owned as part of the Wichita Park System and are operated by Botanica, Inc. a non-profit 501(c)3.\nThe gardens include: an aquatic collection; butterfly garden and 2,880 square foot (270 m\u00b2) butterfly house featuring pansy exhibits during the winter; greenhouse for tropical plants; juniper collection with more than 30 types of junipers; peony collection of 104 cultivars; pinetum; rock garden with sedum and sempervivum; rose garden with more than 350 rose plants; sensory garden; Shakespearean garden; woodlands with azaleas, dogwoods, elm, hackberry, honey locust, mulberry, osage orange, and redbuds; and Xeriscape demonstration garden.\nBotanica opened the Downing Children's Garden in July 2011 and features several themed areas including the monster woods, salamander stream, granddaddy's musical maze, a rainbow and sunflower fountain and plaza.\nA new events center opened in 2014 which will hold 299 people in chairs or 240 at tables.  The inspiration for it came from the wood-and-glass Thorncrown Chapel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a church but it can give that feeling, particularly when you have something spiritual like a wedding. It has that ambience.\u201d  Botanica hosts more than 200 weddings a year, bringing in about 27 percent of its revenue, but it wasn't built with such rentals in mind.In May 2014, it was announced the 1949 Allan Herschell Company carousel from the former Joyland Amusement Park was donated to the Botanica and would be placed in the Downing Children's Garden.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBotanica, official website\nLighting The Way at Wichita's Botanica on YouTube, from Hatteberg's People on KAKE TV news",

          "The most enjoyable sights and sounds included birds, the early-flowering trees, \"bulb flowers\" up and brightly showing their spring colors, dusty purple lenten roses, and trees proudly showing their spring-green new leaves. We all had fun, due to the botanical wonders and family",

        "wiki": "Old Cowtown Museum is an accredited history museum in Wichita, Kansas, United States. It is located next to the Arkansas River in central Wichita.  The Museum was established in 1952, and is one of the oldest open-air history museums in central United States with 54 historic and re-created buildings, including a period farm and out-buildings, situated on 23 acres of land off the original Chisholm Trail.  Cowtown is a combination of attraction, museum, living history site, and historic preservation project.  It is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nSt. Private owners moved it twice then third move to Cowtown in 1952.]]\nThe Museum focuses on life in Wichita during the last part of the 19th century. Cowtown's unique programming tells the story of Wichita's transformation from a frontier settlement to a cattle town to an agricultural and manufacturing area. Its artifact collection includes 12,000+ items dating from the period and ranging from farm wagons to tea spoons. The museum also contains a number of live animals, such as Percheron horses, a short-horned Durham milk cow, two sheep, a goat and chickens.  The Old Cowtown experience includes costumed interpreters, hands-on activities, educational programming and a calendar of diverse events throughout the year.\nCowtown is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, the highest national recognition achievable by a museum.  Only 3% of all museums in the United States are accredited.\n\n\n=== Early Wichita history ===\n\nThe first permanent settlement in Wichita was a collection of grass houses inhabited by the Wichita tribe in 1864.  Pioneer trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site in the 1860s (whom the Chisholm Trail was named).  Wichita was founded in 1868 by businessmen then incorporated as a city in 1870.  The Chisholm Trail ran along the east side of Wichita from 1867 to 1871.  In 1872 the Wichita and Southwestern Railroad completed a branch line from Wichita to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at Newton.  As a result, Wichita became a railhead for cattle drives from Texas, from which it has derived its nickname \"Cowtown.\" Wichita's neighboring town on the opposite (west) bank of the Arkansas River, Delano, a village of saloons and brothels, had a particular reputation for lawlessness, largely accommodating the rough, visiting cattlemen.  The Wichita/Delano community gained a wild reputation, however, the east (Wichita) side of the river was kept more civil, thanks to numerous well-known lawmen who passed through, employed to help keep the rowdy cowboys in line. Among those was Wyatt Earp.  After railroads were extended west and south, Wichita lost the railhead for cattle drives along with the rowdy cowboys that came with it.  In 1880, Delano was annexed by Wichita, then a land boom involving speculation occurred in the late 1880s, and by 1890 the population of Wichita had exploded to nearly 24,000.\n\n\n== Movie film set ==\nVarious movies have used the Old Cowtown Museum site as a film set:\nBender Claim, The - filmed in 2013\nBloody Dawn - filmed in 2006\nMidnight Shanghai - filmed in 2016\nOnly Good Indian, The - filmed in 2007\nRoad to Valhalia - filmed in 2013\nSkylark - filmed in 1992\nTouched by Fire - filmed in 2004\nWichita - filmed in 2013\n\n\n== Hours and Admission ==\nHoursMonday = Closed.\nTuesday to Saturday = 10:00 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nSunday = Noon to 5 p.m. Every Sunday (April to October) is freeAdmissionSenior (62+) = $6.50\nAdult (18-61) = $7.75\nYouth (12-17) = $6.00\nChildren (4-11) = $5.50\nChildren (under 4) = Free\nSpecial prices for groups (15+ people and schools)\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Sedgwick County, Kansas\nAmerican frontier\nGreat Plains\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWhere the Old West Comes to Life : The Story of Old Cowtown Museum; Keith Wondra; 131 pages; 2011.

          "We stopped by Old Cowtown on our second day in Wichita. My wife had been there when she was a kid and now we brought our 3 year old. She loved running down the streets, sitting on the saddles, and watching the actors perform. She even got up on stage at the Saloon and sang for",
          "Another wonderful museum to experience Wichita should be proud of salvaging and restoring these buildings so that many more generations can experience what it was like in the beginning of Wichita\u2019s history",
          "This place is like going back in time. The people were nice and the place was real clean. This is a great place when passing thru Wichita like we were. You can see everything in a couple of hours.",
          "Is my 1st time to go here and is really interesting. Is a nice place to go to have a nice walk. If you like to learn Wichita history, and about cowboys I recommend.",
          "Lovely staff, interesting place. They have gun fight drama with blank ammo which was interesting to me. Spend about 2.5 hours and still could have spend 1 more hour if i had time. Its definately worth $9 i paid for entrance.",
          "Take grand kids to Cowtown several times and they enjoy it. Lots of exhibits depicting life back in the 1800's. They usually have a melodrama type gunfight at noon that the kids find entertaining.",
          "The web site says open high noon till 5. We drove over 1hour to go we get there and a small sign on museum door said CLOSED. What a bummer. I guess I wait and go to Wyoming and see the real thing. Sad. Kids were bummed.",
          "I went to the Old Cowtown Museum when I was a kid and was happy to take my family there this past week. So much history and culture there. The people are knowledgeable and willing to take the time to talk to you. A gem hidden in town that everyone should see at least once.",
          "A great piece of history is you take the time to read the signs. It is more exciting when there are history rein-actors for special celebrations",
          "Very fun and complete explanation of the history of Wichita and surrounding area was founded and developed. Fun place for the kids and not so kids anymore.",
          "Cowtown has been active for many years. It has a bank, post office, a stables, newspaper building, and much more. Sometimes they have country music, food and drink. Also had cowboys on horse back, and use to have gun fights, and even hosted a quick draw contest there. It",
          "This is a well done museum situated among a block museums. A lot of old buildings most of which were moved there from other locations. Some are used in the town as they were intended and others were re-purposed. The history of each building was clearly stated. Very",
          "I love the old buildings and the people are very knowledgeable about our history. Love the Cowboys and the farm animals.",
          "Enjoyed visiting a town from the past. Many of the buildings are originals brought in from a variety of communities. Visitors are welcome to go through all the homes and business (which are all air conditioned). You can have a cold root beer and which a \"dime novel\" shoot out.",
          "This is not much of a place to see Some old style buildings and antiques but is really quite boring. Glad there was no cost involved. Head to the Botanical instead as it\u2019s beautiful and a very nice kids area as well",
          "We traveled from Kansas City to Wichita to spend a few days doing touristy things with our 6 year old grandsons. Our first stop was Old Cow Town. As we were there on a Sunday in July, admission was free. Can't beat free! We arrived in time for the 1:00pm gunfight on Main",
          "Didn\u2019t know what to expect coming here but I was super impressed! We\u2019ve spent the last 5 days on a road trip from Utah so we\u2019ve seen MANY museums and moments across Kansas and this honestly has been the most impressive. It\u2019s not so much a museum as an experience. You get to walk",
          "Very interesting. We took our grandson out for the day and we all had a very good time. We really enjoyed the gunfight.",
          "This was an interesting stop but we were a little disappointed in the end. We saw the reviews and were looking for things to do in Kansas on our way to Colorado. This looked cool so we drove 2 hours out of our way to see it. Not worth the drive. I would recommend it if you are",
          "Halloween time is especially fun for all ages. The staff dressed in costumes. Great job on decorating the whole place for Halloween. The gun show was my favorite.",

          "We went here during River Fest hoping it would be maybe not as busy and it wasn't. I felt like we had the whole place almost to ourselves which was great for us, maybe not so great for Cowtown but my kid LOVED it. The staff was SO INCREDIBLY AMAZING! Everybody was so nice and",
          "We were a little doubtful when we pulled in, but as soon as we got inside we were all amazed. It feels like we were going back in time. The \"real\" gun fight was my children's favorite part!",

          "it was a great step back in time to see wichita and some of the original buildings. It was nice to have people dressed up and know historical accurate information about wichita in the 1800's.",
          "This place is a great gateway for kids to start the wagon train moving in their understanding of our western states. I love Cowtown! A great place to take kids of all ages, giving them a real glance at the life of the plainsman. Don't miss the Blood Homestead.",
          "I discovered the Cowtown museum a year ago and vowed to return. I was blessed to see it again this year on our annual visit to Wichita. It is a beautiful historic old west town which features actual period buildings which includes but is not limited to a working farm,",

          "Fun educational experience for the kids. Definitely a must see if you have an afternoon. We love to go during education days so the kids can see demonstrations.",
          "It was a really nice place to visit I thought it would be more like Williamsburg where they act out their parts and live the town in that time period but it was not like that. Still it was really nice for pictures and to get out and walk.",
          "I confess, I am comparing this experience with some truly great reenactment sites like Cittie of Henricus and Colonial Williamsburg, but this visit just fell flat. Parking is free and seemed plentiful on a moderately slow day. It's now $9 per adult at the door. Payment is at",
          "Traveling through and some business got cancelled so I thought I would check it out. I thought I would be there for a half hour and the price was right so \"why not\". But over 2 hours later I came away with a great appreciation for the \"Old West\". The staff did a great job of",
          "This place is very good for big kids and young teens, who are willing to see, that the world wasn't always like it is now. Everything here is as authentic as possible in our world, including the staffs attire. People here are very friendly, always ready to explain everything,",

          "This place was a very good two hours spent. I was there at opening and had the place pretty much to myself. I went in every door I could and if you've ever wondered what it must have been like, you will know after coming here. All of the proprietorships were set up for business,",
          "Out of season visit so no one dressed up to play the citizens. A fine collection of buildings and it was a bonus to be able to go inside them and see how life was in the Old West over one hundred years ago. Being out of season meant you could take your time strolling from",
          "It is always great to step back into history. I visited before the opening of the season with a tour group. We had a blast going back in time. Non the less it was nice just to walk around and see inside these buildings. I love going back in time. Even though I probably wouldn't",
          "We visited here during the off season so we did not get the full experience with period actors etc. We did enjoy seeing the historical buildings and being able to go inside to see items from that time period.",
          "This is a great way to step back into history and learn the past of Wichita. Reenactments, live gun fights, and a working saloon. My kids love this place. Make sure to wear comfortable tennis shoes. The best time to go is in the spring or fall. Winter is too cold and summer is",
          "If you want to know what the old west was like, this is a good place to go. From a dirt main street to a working farm, a saloon to newspaper to a school to a church, it has what a small town was like",

          "Haven\u2019t been here in over 30 years and it was great from a nostalgic view to how good this place really is. The exhibits really show how life was during the pioneer days and really interesting whether old or young. I\u2019m surprised hasn\u2019t capitalized and made this an even bigger",
          "If you want to experience what Kansas was life in the days before car travel, this is a great experience for the family. Our family really enjoyed watching the blacksmith work, seeing a working farm area, the shops back in the day to purchasing sasparilla at the saloon. The best",
          "Old Cowtown Historical Museum is a wonderful way to spend a day with family or friends. It's not entertaining in the way video games are, but if you are willing to invest yourself in reading the information provided in each display and letting your imagination take you to what",
          "My family and I went for the Christmas special that was going on at the museum. I really appreciated all of the activities that were kid friendly and enjoyable for adults. It was like stepping into the old west. We all had so much fun, I can't wait to go back during the day.",
          "Cowtown is not a collection of made for exhibit buildings. What you see there are real buildings collected from local towns and farms . These are real houses, barns, school rooms, etc. that were rescued when modern society was going to demolish them to make room for modern",
          "Been several times including when I was a child. They have fixed it up a little too much from years ago & by doing so kind of ruined it a bit from then. It used to have bullet holes in the walls & such that really made it more realistic from that era, but that kind of stuff is",

          "We took our young grandson & nephew to Old Cowtown Museum, and they loved it. They liked the animals, the gun fight in the street, seeing a storm trooper, (I know, not really a cow town kind of character, but still fun), getting to shake hands with the sheriff, and then other",
          "Great place to see what life was like back in the old days. they have people dressed in the clothes of the time.",
          "This is a must trip for local and out of town visitors. If you like frontier days in the natural setting and don't mind a little dirt and wind, the people who work and operate this site have a great persona and are so welcoming. Along the banks of the Arkansas River, you can",

          "I had never been to Cowtown since moving to the Wichita area nearly 30 years ago. I went last Friday to the Education day to help out with Prairie Quilt Guild teaching children and some adults how to hand sew and quilt. A great time was had by all. Some 1800 students, mostly",
          "Last 3 events we attended at Cowtown this fall have been great and we were so happy we came. Great staff.",
          "Wonderful experience walking around the old town with the different houses and shops. You can go inside in all these buildings and read about the history and the former owners. People are dressed fitting to that time and performing a gunfight or dancing in the saloon.",
          "I have performed here and this place is great. 33 buildings and a full working 1880s farm make it a great place for all. Saloons with foid and dance hall girls and all the buildings have been moved in from tbe area. Great staff and lots of fun.",
          "The buildings were very interesting and filled with lots of artifacts. NO shootout ... limited items in saloon. Would have been nice to have someone to talk to on tour",
          "We have wanted to visit this ever since we saw the movie Family Vacation. It is well worth the time whether you are a couple or a large group. The buildings are stocked with items from the era. Flash photography is allowed. A real trip into the old wild west. We made it",
          "We ended up going on a Sunday which was free admission starting at noon. We walked around the small town and interacted with the horses on the farm. Went to the saloon and had a sarsaparilla. Started getting crowded as we were leaving so i would recommend going on Sunday at noon",
          "The wild west comes into sharp focus with this frontier town! Living history explodes before our eyes. Magnificent entry way with the inverted railroad lead into adventure, excitement, and living history. The most excellent immersion into history.",
          "I enjoyed my visit very much. It was after Labor Day so not crowded, just a handful of people at the museum. Very interesting and everyone very knowledgeable and friendly. Recommend you see this if you like history.",
          "It's been well over 20 years since I'd been here and so much improvement has happened that still maintains the spirit and integrity of the old west town that is Cowtown.",
          "We love history, old building architecture, stories of real people who lived long ago. Imagine living in a western town back in mid 1800's. This is what you experience here and we loved it! It's not a real town but it sure looks like it. Many buildings are original and moved",
          "Cowtown in Wichita, KS is a great place to experience history first hand. The buildings are all original to the area so you can see how our settlers lived and worked. They have cowboy gunfights which are neat to watch. Cowtown also has a great event center that you can rent for",
          "We were very excited to visit this \"museum\" with our 3 and 7 year old grandchildren. All of us enjoyed walking through the town of 1870 houses and businesses. We had fun playing school and the kids games. We ate at the saloon and sat a spell. We loved the variety of",

          "We went for the first time. Its very impressive, big could easily spend all day with kids. Lots of demonstrations the day we went, gunfight, Indians etc. good for history buffs who are into the old west. It was hot hot, which made it a little tough. Would be a great visit in",

          "We brought an eleven-year-old girl we were babysitting here during one of their FREE Sundays, and we had a marvelous time! Cowtown is HUGE! There are so many different old shops and buildings to explore. They've done a great job preserving the old feel to the place. It was hot,",
          "We were there on a day when we had to pay, but only half price since there was construction at some of the buildings. There were a few costumed interpreters and everything looks authentic to the late 1800's, but we weren't impressed. As history buffs we've been to other 19th",
          "If a person loves Western History then they need to visit this outdoor living museum. During the year they offer free admission days--which was a day that we attended. Be sure to watch one of their live gun fights at 1pm or 3pm. There is a lot to see and you will easily spend a",
          "I love this place, I could go back fifty times and not feel like it's enough! A great experience where I actually enjoyed history (how often is that?)",
          "We were fortunate enough to go on a free admission day. We really weren't expecting it to be as cool as it was. It was like taking a step back in time. We walked through all the buildings and were able to see a good ole fashioned shootout in the middle of town. I highly",
          "We went on a free admission day to the museum. It\u2019s an outdoor place that\u2019s laid out and themed like an old western town. There\u2019s lots of different historically themed buildings that are filled with historical artifacts to replicate how they would have been so you can see what",
          "We love history and wanted to see what some old time houses and business would have looked like. This place was great. Lots of variety from homes, churches, school, and businesses. There was a lot of construction going on when we were there and the road is extremely dusty",
          "The Old Cowtown museum is a collection of historical buildings that have been brought into the area in a rough assembly that resembles a late 1800's township. Some of the buildings are as old as 1850 and others were built after 1900. But all are the original buildings, which",
          "When I was growing up in Wichita, I pestered my parents constantly to bring me here. They never did, and I left home without having seen it. 40+ years later, I finally got here. It wasn't worth a lifetime of waiting. The buildings were great, and quite interesting. I was very",
          "This was quite a unique, fun, difference experience. I loved how the museum is like a small town with all the time pieces in place. We had a wonderful time!",
          "I liked this place. There was an assortment of old buildings replicating an old Western town. The Saloon offers snacks and drinks (Sasparilla). Recommend comfortable walking shoes and bottled water during the trip inside. Part of the exhibit was under construction, so they",
          "We have visited several living history museums with some better than others. I would rate this one average for that genre. There is an interesting collection of buildings to view and enter. The gunfight was entertaining. If you go during the summer I would suggest that you",
          "As a history-buff, this place was GREAT! They moved all these old buildings back in the 1950s/1960s to this area and restored them. You can go inside each building and wander around (which could be bad for those with younger kids). For a limited time, the admission is free on",
          "Hard to complain when something was free, but this attraction could have been a lot more entertaining. The old buildings and stores were interesting, but if all the characters walking around town were actually stationed in the various shops with knowledge of how they were run,",
          "Let me say that we were there during a special event. This *may* have taken away from the reenactments/actors roaming around telling their accounts. There were also vendors selling items (jewelry,oils) in some of the buildings that took away from the overall feel. The town",

          "I love this place, many years ago, I was even a reenactor. Little did I know what you had to do to become a reenactor. You must have not only the desire to want to \"Live\" in the 1800's but you had to study the history of Wichita, the founding father's, the first people who",
          "At first we were expecting more. When you walk in the \"town\" it just seems like abandoned old buildings with no people around. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and there's no people. But once you start walking around there are people and then when you go inside the",
          "The Cowtown museum was well worth the admission price. We appreciated walking in buildings that were relocated there but really were from the late 1800's. The gun fight was well done. I would like to go back and plan on spending at least 3 hours.",
          "It wasn't bad I was just a little disappointed. The staff was friendly. I just felt like more could have been done with the displays.",
          "Really interesting to walk around this wild west town, just as it would have been 100 years ago. Everything from the saloon to the blacksmiths and the school house, most of them being the original buildings. Lots of supporters dressed in period clothes, saloon girls, the marshal",
          "I enjoyed an evening at Old Cowtown Museum for Victorian Christmas again this year. Old Cowtown is one of the best examples of an early western town with several historical homes and buildings dating back into the 1800's. It is definitely worth a visit.",
          "This place was hands down one of my favorites of all time. Be prepared to do some walking but it is totally worth it. This is a place the whole family can enjoy from small children to teens.",
          "We loved it. Be ready to walk more than you planned as it's huge! Every sort of shop/old business you can think of. Incase you wonder what a funeral home looked like 150 yrs ago. ;) our kids are 10, 9, 4, and 2, and they asked questions and learned a lot. So did we! A cheap",
          "This is much more extensive (not expensive) than a typical \"old town\" that you might find in other cities. I think most of the buildings are original, and they're arranged like an Old West downtown, with a homestead/farm a short walk away. It really reminded me of historical",
          "My wife and I had some time to kill so we went to this museum. When we walked into one of the houses, we saw to photos of a man and woman who lived in the house. Later that day we say the same photos in the African-American museum. Turns out they are the great-great grandparents",
          "My husband and I decided to come and visit while we were in Wichita. It was a chilly day, and a few buildings were closed at the time, but it was a good visit. We enjoy the history and going in the houses/businesses and seeing how it was back in the day. We'll definitely have to",
          "Old Cowtown has a great collection of historical buildings that replicate the early days of Wichita and the old west. They have regular events with special themes and it's also great to just go and stroll the streets immersing one's self in what it might have been like to live",
          "It's always a fun time here. Cowtown always has different things going on, different educational meetings, and it's a great place to visit year round. If you've never been to the Victorian Christmas celebration, you really should. Check their website and other websites for to",
          "We visited old cow town museum this past weekend and had so much fun! There weren't many visitors when we got there in the early afternoon so it almost felt like we had the town to ourselves! When walking to the museum from our car it almost didn't seem like we had the right",
          "This place was amazing. It was really cold out, so there was only one other visitor when we got there at 10 am. The buildings are original and set up as close to the way they were for the time. It's like stepping back in time as you go through each building. We ran out of time",
          "I took my 8 and 10 year old kids to the Old Cowtown Museum on a Saturday morning. It was a blast! The old buildings and the overall facilities are very well kept. The volunteer staff was very kind and we enjoyed the Wild West shootout in the main square.",
          "Was a great day spent learning how buildings , tools , dentists, doctors and many other things were in the late 1800's. The people on site were very knowledgeable of the history of Wichita, the man in the carpenter shop was very good.",
          "Very well laid out, extremely clean. Lots of relics from that time period. Interesting and extremely educational. Would be great for people of all ages and families.",
          "Well done and fantastic to look through to see how our ancestors lived through the ages. If you really want to take photos and to seriously look at all the exhibits, I don't recommend going to look around when they have family Halloween activities on or big crowd family days,",
          "Nice to go back in time. This place was carefully planned. It really looks and feels like a town way back when. We enjoyed it. Great learning for kids.",
          "For someone with any interest in western history, Old Cowtown is a great experience. Historical structures have been appropriately furnished for the period. We spent several hours there hoping not to miss a thing.",
          "The people were nice. One woman gave us a ride in a golf cart to where the buildings were so my wife wouldn't have to walk on her bad knees. Saw a shootout between bad guys and the sheriff. All was shot but the women and kids. Visited with a very knowledgeable man in the Masonic",
          "I take my kids to Old Cowtown regularly. Sometimes we pop in and out and sometimes we wander for quite sometime. The volunteers who make Cowtown come to life are fantastic and everyone has a great time while learning about history.",
          "Cowtown truly takes you back to the good ol western days!! It's like you went back in time and you are truly there. My kids love it and so do I. Sometimes they are not fully staffed and do not have all of the people there working so some of the stores are closed down and you",
          "Everything in this museum is amazing and authentic. Everyone dressed period appropriate, and stay in character. Kid friendly, lots to see, but lots to read as well. Definitely a place to stop if you are in Wichita! Cowtown is also PERFECT for a childs birthday party! They have",
          "There was a larger than expected turnout for the Haunting. There were several tour leaders, however, for the special event. We had planned to go before knowing about the haunting tour. We only did part of the tour with the group. Some of the buildings are air conditioned",
          "Nice place for an outing with the kids and the dog. Path is smooth enough for skateboarding. Plenty of decent people out with family, not much worry about riff raff",
          "They call it a museum, but it is so much more. It's a town. A town you can walk through and ask questions of the \"townspeople\". This should be on anyone's list of place to visit whether you live in Wichita or are visiting. It really is a step back in time!",
          "Was in Wichita on a business trip and had a few hours to spare. Pretty cool to see a part of history. The characters/actors were really awesome to talk to. Really glad that we visited",
          "I was so excited for this, but turned out to be very disappointing. The brochure made it seem amazing but it really wasn't. Needs some help.",
          "Good place to take kids to have fun and learn about history. Reenactments were cute and the volunteers are really nice.",
          "This is a must see if your in Wichita. Whether you have children or not doesn't matter. Great history and entertainment.",
          "I did this because nothing else seemed to be open on Sunday, but I ended up enjoying it. Lots of interesting historical buildings and furnishings and other items. There's a shoot-out on main street. The day I was there was very hot, but many of the buildings have air",
          "We almost didn't go but I'm glad we did. The museum is set up to resemble Wichita, Kansas in the late 1800s. All of the buildings are original, not recreations, and were moved to the museum. The museum includes shops, a saloon, a doctor's office, a farm, church, school and homes",
          "I have lived in Wichita my entire life but bad never been to Cowtown. My company offered a free day so I went with my mom, aunt, grandmother, teenage cousin, and his friend. I thought I would be bored but it was fantastic. You are able to go in to a lot of the buildings and they",

          "Very nice place to visit. Very reasonable cost. We took our 4 and 8 year old grandchildren but turns out they are a little young to appreciate the history and surroundings. They did really enjoy the gunfight though. Would have loved for them to be able to get closer to the",
          "This is a great place to visit for the historical side of things. The gun fights are good, maybe a little over the top on the acting. They do need to post rules to observe during the gunfights and have things blocked off adequately instead of being short with the patrons when",
          "Took family from out of state here and enjoyed a fun photo shoot, an old fashioned \"gun fight\" and seeing lots of history from the old days in Wichita. Many of the buildings are air conditioned and now they have a building with a video giving the history of the Wichita area.",

          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Old Cow Town. Extremely authentic - people in period dress, soda for sale in the saloon, and a gun fight on main street. Super fun - glad we swung off the highway to tour - all buildings but one are authentic - staff extremely personable and",
          "This is a really nice attraction. Had a great time. I went with my husband and two grown sons. We all had a good time. My youngest son is in the military, so we all got in free (which was really nice), but it is worth the normal admission price. If you enjoy history, you should",

          "This exhibit is walking tour of what the area around Wichita was like from the post-Civil War time to the late 19th century. Fun and easy walking tour of what the downtown area was like, various shops, homes in that era, and a working farm somewhat away from town. It was",

          "We visited on a weekday when school kids were there and it was a little hectic :). The location itself is a nice palce to visit if you want to learn about the roots of Wichita and some of the founding families and homes that were built. Most of the homes/stores are open to",
          "This place takes you back to the way it was. Stables, blacksmithing, saloons, it was great. The place was the way it was back in the 1800. Lots of history. A walking tour. Go at your own pace. I was told in the summer the have horse drawn carriage rides.",
          "Really enjoyed the look back in time stage coach ride should have circled the whole thing with option to get off at the farm",

          "Living abroad in the UK, I love telling the Brits how awesome this place is and they are always intrigued!! I did take one of my British friends here before and they loved it. Wichita residents really don't give Cowtown enough credit as it is actually quite a unique experience.",
          "I really enjoyed this little cowtown, mainly because I really appreciate the old West. You get to experience what it might have liked to live back in the day. I even got to snuggle with a horse, and there was a really friendly kitty roaming around to be petted. It was really",

          "Okay, I am going to start this off by saying I am biased (I work at a western museum, so I have very high standards for what I want to see) That being said, this was a cool museum. Would have liked to have had more interaction from the workers, again working at a western museum,",
          "We decided to check this out after running low of ideas for things to do in Wichita. Let me just say, this place is completely awesome. I can't believe it's listed as #5, it should be the #1 thing to do. Its basically a town built and set up like it would have been in the late",
          "I've only ever been here with a schedule group of people or over Christmas, so we've always experienced all the shops being open and characters throughout the area. The kids loved it. Their Christmas shows are especially fun, we'll likely go back again this year.",
          "This is a walk through town. You can go in most of the buildings and they are so real looking. I especially enjoyed the school and the church. In fact, I think I probably enjoyed this more than the Dodge City similar. The only down side is that a friend I was traveling with",
          "Not really much here. A few nice restaurants and a really good breakfast shop that I loved, but wish I could remember the name of it because the food was great and we had a really fun, sassy waitress, but I digress. I come to town once and year and don't really go here any more",

          "Cow Town is a lot of fun, especially if youre into the old west. The old buildings and the period costumes and just the historic atmosphere is not to be missed. I'd like to see some more animals but thats a minor nitpick. We took my inlaws while they were visiting and because my",
          "So much fun! Our group in town for business really enjoyed our visit to Old Cowtown, which was actually for an after-hours catered event, but they were kind enough to have many of the buildings open, and interpreters on site to chat with us. Certainly a place that should be on",
          "I love kitsch. The Old Cowtown Museum is the perfect place to lament on how bad people had it while also having a really good time. Highlights include: trying not to die while playing with old time toys (such as basic stilts, stick and hoop, etc), reading the labels in the",

          "With 80% original buildings, this living museum is awesome! The custodians are very knowledgeable and make the extra effort to bring you back in time with their costumes and manners. We showed up an hour before close on a Sunday and we're worried we missed everything. Nope.",
          "Our first visit to old cowtown was for their steampunk day, and it was awesome, the place was PERFECT and the educational aspect blended so well with the fun fantastical steampunk activities. We felt welcomed and embraced by their staff, and it was a great day!",

          "This is a great place to visit if you are not familiar with the old West or cow towns. Some of the times when rein-actors are there it is quit entertaining and educational and perfect for the kids as well. If you never been or first time to Wichita, I would put it on the list.",
          "This is a good example of a old town from our history. Once inside you can walk in the bldgs. and see out they lived back then. The noon show was good, I think they need a few wireless mics so they can be heard.",

          "My history buff grandson really liked see what the early Wichita looked like. It was over 100 degrees, so it was too hot for the horses to be pulling wagons (also for grandma). Many buildings had correctly dressed volunteers that gave the history of the buildings or trades",
          "This little place will take you back to the old days, when a family of 8 shared a tiny little house with an out-house in the back. Like an old west movie, it was fun to see old buildings with actors in their costumes walking around. And many people that live in Wichita don't",

          "For the price, $8.00 it is an excellent way to spend the day. The staff dressed in period costume and the grounds made you feel like you went back to the 1870's. The city of Wichita has preserved this museum in keeping with the era.",

          "Interesting historical \"living museum.\" \nIt's unrealistic but appreciated that many of the buildings are air conditioned. \nFood options are very limited so eat before you go.\nI'm not sure why they do the shootouts.

        "wiki": "Exploration Place is a science museum located on the west side of the Arkansas River in the Delano neighborhood of Wichita, Kansas, United States.  It is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 1980s, a plan to consolidate the city-owned Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center and the Children's Museum of Wichita was proposed. In 1992, a capital funds campaign was launched, and with an endowment from Velma Lunt Wallace, funds from the City of Wichita and Sedgwick County, and other donations, the museum opened in the spring of 2000.\nThe museum is supported by admissions, membership dues, Sedgwick County government, and other public support and voluntary contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations.  In 2017 the museum is expected to reach approximately 200,000 attendees.\n\n\n== Building ==\nConstruction began May 1997 and took 2 \u00bd years. Internationally acclaimed architect Moshe Safdie of Boston designed the building. There are 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) and 20 acres (81,000 m2) on the property. The tallest point of the building is the peak of the roof of the traveling exhibits space and is 70 feet (21 m) above the floor (nearly 7 stories high). The combined distance around the interior perimeter of both buildings is approximately one mile.The \"Island Building\" is named because it is surrounded by water, with the Arkansas River on one side and the reflecting pond on the other. The reflecting pond is between the buildings to create the illusion that looks like the river runs between the buildings. The reflecting pond is one to three feet deep. Even though the building is so close to the river it is not prone to flooding because it is above the 100-year flood level. During the flood in October 1998, the worst in recent history, the water level was still more than 8 feet (2.4 m) below the finished floor level.\n\n\n== Digital Dome Theater and Planetarium ==\nThis venue is the largest dome theater in Kansas with a 60-foot high, 360-degree screen.  It shows digital films.  General museum admission is not required to see a show at the dome.\n\n\n== Kemper Creative Learning Studio ==\nThis venue is a 150-seat theater equipped with audio/visual equipment, sound system, podium and stage lighting. It is the home of live science shows.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nBig Mouth - a seven-foot tall model of the human mouth that tests good oral health knowledge\nBridging Art and Science - featuring local artists whose work illustrates the important ties between art and science\nDesign, Build, Fly - includes flight simulators and a giant \"wind wall\" made of thousands of tiny reflective discs that show air currents generated by a real airplane propeller and two wind generators mounted on a tower.\nExplore Kansas - features facts about the state's land, water, weather and inhabitants.\nKansas in Miniature - a small-scale recreation of early-1950s Kansas buildings, landmarks and more.\nKEVA: Build Your Mind - features 4 1/2-inch long KEVA Planks and focuses on design aesthetics and engineering.\nNano - features real world applications to nano-scale science, engineering, and technology\nKansas Kids Connect - an immersive area where young children will discover the world around them and find out how country and city living are more alike than we may think.\nTraveling exhibits - an area which has hosted more than 30 different temporary exhibits including A T. rex Named Sue, Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition, CSI: The Experience, and Star Wars:\u00ae Where Science Meets Imagination.\nWhere Kids Rule - includes a three-story medieval castle where children can experience more than 60 hands-on, STEM-based exhibits.\n\n\n== Explore Store ==\nThis 1,900 square-foot shopping extravaganza connects you to science, educational toys and even funky fun! The store is now one of the few places in the area to feature fair trade items. All purchases help support Exploration Place. General museum admission is not required to shop the store.\n\n\n== Outdoors ==\nExploration Park - free venue that includes wetlands habitat, adventure play yard, picnic groves and Festival Plaza\n\n\n== Hours and admission ==\n\nHoursTuesday to Saturday - 10:00 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nSunday - Noon to 5 p.m.\nClosed on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.

          "We had a small team building event and it was so much fun. We Focused on the aviation part Of the museum, but also visited the Kansas and Shark exhibits. All well done, especially the Aviaiton section. The museum design is beautiful and its location on the river was fabulous.",
          "Design, build, fly airplanes! Now this will get the kids interested in working in the aircraft industry and may even pique their interest in flying planes as a career! Also, they have a great shark exhibit right now which is complemented by a great movie in the dome theater.",

          "Not bad, but this science museum in very much geared towards kids. We went in thinking this was going to be more a St Louis Science Center type place. I would actually categorize this as more of a children's museum ( which everyone we talked to before going portrayed more as a",

          "I remember as a kid, when Exploration Place first opened, and I was totally amazed! I've visited many more times since then & now get to take my nieces & nephews! This place just has such a wealth of information & activities that teach the kids so much, but in such fun ways,",
          "We spent a morning at Exploration Place and could have stayed much longer. We enjoyed watching the IMAX movie in the Dome Theatre and exploring the hands-on exhibits. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Took our family here for a great afternoon. Lots to do. Kept us busy for hours. Interesting place to visit.",
          "New science/discovery type centre where you can stand in an enclosed booth and feel what a tornado is like. Very cool, with lots of hands-on experiences for adults and kids.",
          "Exploration Place doesn't get the props it deserves. The facility is clean and beautiful and the exhibits/attractions are both fun and educational. Something for kids of all ages, too!",
          "Took our toddler to see one of their short productions: \"Chirpie's Magical Sky.\" Bought some popcorn and drinks and our son seemed to enjoy himself. The mini production was about 12 minutes long and our son wanted to see it again. He kept asking for \"Chirpie!\" Content was",
          "When Exploration Place opened years ago, I frequently took my toddler grandchildren. It was our favorite thing to do in Wichita. When my 2 teenage granddaughters were recently visiting, and we had a free afternoon, I suggested a few places we could go. The choice was a",
          "If you're traveling with young children and young teens, this is one of the best places to go! They have a few different traveling exhibits per year and interactive permanent exhibits for the young ones to enjoy. Among those is a castle where kids can play dress up, 'fish', and",
          "Stopped here on a quick trip with our almost 4-year old. Had a good time. Some areas were more age appropriate than others. He really enjoyed the Middle Ages themed castle area. He also loved the flight and design area with the airplanes and simulators. If the weather has been",

          "This place is awesome. I am a huge fan of art and science museums and this one did not disappoint. There was so many awesome things to go see and do the only thing is that there were 7 school groups there too and it was too busy for my taste. We also went to violent universe and",
          "My kids enjoy visiting the different exhibits here. There is a lot to be learned here as well as fun to be had!",
          "We were told this was something to go see while we were in Wichita, but this is really geared for kids. There are many interactive things for the kids to do. The only fun thing was the interactive planes, we and many of the other adults enjoyed this. You got to sit in life size",
          "im a science nut so i may be a bit biased but i found it to be overpriced and not too impressive. even their crown attraction the dome theatre was a bit lackluster. it was a bit boring. i can see they tried but just not a place i care to revisit",
          "The area and idea are grand, however, I expected more for the price. May be great for children but still lacking. Sometimes they have traveling attractions come through, but those are so expensive I wouldn't bother to go.",
          "Our grandkids LOVE it here! Ages 5-12, They all ran off to explore and play - their 3rd visit here. The grand daughters love the castle, the boys love the airplanes and simulators. It kept them busy for hours. We went to the \"class\" on electricity, led by a very interesting",
          "Went with my nieces little kids. Lots of things to do and see. Learn about science without really knowing that's what you're doing.",
          "We had a great time here and the kids really loved it as well. Mabe not as big as some places, but everything they have here is excellent. Well worth the money. They are on top of their game at this place. Keep up the great work. Loved the kids play area. That castle set up is",
          "Our grandchildren love Exploration Place! They have lots of activities for all ages. The younger ones especially like the Castle area but there is much to do and see. Very good value for the cost. They have a nice restaurant and snack area too.",
          "We've been here many times and it never get old for the kids, even as they get older. Check the schedules for events and give yourself time to see everything.",
          "My top place to visit in Wichita. There is always something new happening here and it's never a dull moment. If you get a minute, go check out the movies playing in the Dome Theatre!",
          "Took my boys (7 & 2) for the day and they had a blast. They loved the kids castle and the building station. We didn't see any movies, but we spent so much time playing that we wouldn't of had time anyway. I wish we would have brought snacks because the snack shop was not open",
          "Grandchildren were so excited about this place. Even I learned more about germs but the Kansas room was fantastic for them to explain all about their world in Wichita. We even got to experience what a tornado is like (without the dangers of it).",
          "This is a great place for kids. The exhibits are interactive and appeal to all ages. The airplane room is fun. We went to a creator lab and built light up cards (circuits). There is a great castle. The only thing the kids didn't love was the traveling, \"What's Eating You\"",
          "We make regular trips to Exploration place to see the different exhibits that come through. You can take your kids or go alone and there is plenty of appeal for young and old alike. The theaters are extra $ but you can go to them by themselves or as part of the complete package.",
          "I went with my wife, step daughter and 2 grandkids to explore and give the kids something to do. I think I got as excited by some of the things offered as the kids did and I know my wife did. It is definitely worth the admittance and a must for anyone with a family.",
          "Exploration Place changes their exhibits every few months. Some are better than others but it's always a great place to spend a Saturday with the kids. They're sure to learn lots AND have fun doing it, no matter the exhibits.",
          "There is a lot to see at Exploration Place, with a lot of hands on things for kids and adults alike. The whole family will enjoy visiting the science exhitbits. The train set is so neat with a replica of Wichita. The tornado exhibit is fun to see and go in. Everyone learns",
          "Exploration Place, I believe, has good intentions with their vision. It is kid friendly, My biggest complaint with this attraction is the majority of the time you go, there is several items in the traveling exhibits that do not work. Things that are a permanent part of the",
          "Beautiful building by Moshe Safdie. Great exhibits for kids and adults. We really enjoyed our visit.",

          "My wife and daughter and I, with a friend, went here September 7th. We arrived a little late in the day, about 2 - 3 pm, but that was enough time for our daughter. My wife was excited for the putt-putt course, but we didn't have time. Some of the crafts are too old for my",
          "Most interesting displays and very good information presentation. Great for the family and especially for the children. Many exhibits that attract the young at hart as well as the children of any age.",
          "Don't have high expectations of a stimulating tine. The traveling exhibit about skateboarding was dry and boring for a seven year old girl. Many parts of the exhibit were out of order. Waste of time. This Museum is architecturally beautiful located on the Arkansas River,",
          "Went here with my daughter and my friend and her 2 boys. The boys had a blast as did my daughter. I really enjoyed going through Exploration Place. Definitely a place to take kids to.",
          "Great place to take the kids and let then go through the exhibits. I really liked the model train town. The tornado exhibit was interesting. A lot of science you can get involved with. Balance, heart rate, and some old time myths about smoking.",
          "Great place. My children love to go. But they never change anything other than the traveling exhibits. We don't go very often because it gets very redundant.",
          "Interesting exhibits but only for kids under 14. Description says for \"all ages\", but our college aged boys were bored and embarrassed to be there. Waste of money for what was offered.",
          "After checking this place out online we were expecting a little more out of it. We had a good time and it was well worth the price for admission but just seemed to fall a little short for us.",
          "We decided to visit Exploration Place one rainy afternoon. The kids had lots of fun running from one exhibit to the next. There were lots of things for them to interact with and they really had fun. It was nice because the place wasn't overly crowded or overly stimulating. I",
          "A nice place to visit, but don't go without kids because that's what it's 100% geared for. I\"ve taken my two kids there (under 10 years old) and they liked it, but it was just not really worth what they charge to get in.",
          "One of my best friends and I stopped in to kill some time while in Wichita on business. We had a blast! We are both 30-something and kids at heart. There was great hands-on exhibits of planes and flight simulators, air current simulations, wildlife exhibits, a castle/medieval",
          "Spent about 3 hours there with a toddler, didn't try to see an IMAX but the little one enjoyed walking through the exhibits. Favorites were the medevil play area, block area although it made me nervous because of the desire my child has to kick over tall built towers! Tot Spot",
          "My husband and I visited Wichita to see a concert, we had a whole day to kill so we started off at Exploration Place. This is a science center/childrens museum/planetarium place AND they have mini-golf. We did all of it, starting with mini golf, which could be better but it was",
          "i took my kids here when they were little and exploration place had just opened. now, a few years later I went back and was quite disappointed! although they do try and bring new attractions in on a regular basis, many of the displays didn't work, were broken or simply didn't",
          "If it wasn't for the few new attractions this place brings in it's a one shot wonder in my opinion. We've been to several children's museums and science museums and Exploration place is the only one I haven't wished to return to because it was 'so much fun'.",
          "This place is very educational but fun at the same time! The kids that I was traveling with range in age from 7- 20 one of them being special needs and they all had a blast exploring here. I don't even think they realized how much they were learning. My only complaint was that",
          "Lots of activities for all ages. The aviation displays are very good.Tornado simulator was much liked.",
          "I took my 31/2-year-old granddaughter to Exploration Place. She did not want to go because she had never been there, but when I countered her insistence that she would rather play with toys by saying there were toys at Exploration Place, she agreed. Of course, she had a fine",
          "Little kids love this place. There are traveling exhibits and lots of interactive and educational displays. My kids especially liked playing in the castle and stepping into the tornado simulation. It does seem a little expensive for what you get. We have been to bigger and",
          "The miniature train was neat. The dome show was fun and my kids loved the castle ! Some of the exhibits were not working so it was slightly disappointing but overall they had fun.",
          "It is a hit or miss with this place. They have some pretty cool traveling exhibits but not all the time and some of them are not for me. The tickets are a bit on the expensive side but the kids seem to like it.",
          "Great place to explore different science experiments and hands on exhibits. A lot of history and science here. A lot for the kids to do. Don't miss the tornado exhibit, you can stand inside and feel the effects of a tornado or play on of the flight simulators. A little expensive",
          "I visited on 2/28/14 with two of my daughters who are 7 and 10 years old. The facility itself is clean and well maintained. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. The activities were fun, but my 7 year old was more engaged than the 10 year old. I saw older groups of kids",
          "We took our granddaughter who is 5. She had a great time! Lots of interactive exhibits for this age. It was fun following her around and taking part as she tried all the different opportunities. Some of the exhibits are always there but many of them are seasonal or visiting.",
          "My kids want to go back! Great hands on experiences, the kids don't realize they are actually learning. Fun for adults too.",
          "If it's during school year, you might prefer going on a weekend. The place is full of kids. There is usually a special display going on but other than that the displays and interactive areas are pretty static. It's in a beautiful spot on the Arkansas (they say arKANSAS) River.",
          "Exploration Place is a good place to take the kids. There are a lot of interactive exhibits. Some areas are starting to look a little tired but kids who have never been there will enjoy it. The last time I was there I had my three grandchildren; 12 yrs. 9 yrs. 8 yrs. We",
          "This is great place to spend with kids but it is very nice for adults too. The best time to be there early before it gets crowded. Make sure you have at least 2 hours to enjoy this place",
          "Think this is our third or fourth visit, and my eight year old son still enjoys it. He's currently airplane crazy so the Aviation Gallery was a big hit. He also enjoyed the Kansas in Miniature exhibit because of the trains (and, as one who's been all over Kansas, it really is",

          "This is a nice educational & fun place. We have been here several time with our family and grandchildren. The last time we watched them disect a shark!",
          "It is not worth the admission price to visit this museum. There are only 3 galleries so not many exhibits. The site is interesting with the building being built on the river.",
          "This is one of the great science museum to visit. Lucky that we have a science museum membership (ASTC) that we can use it here to get in FREE. My kids love making paper planes, unfortunately they did not stock up enough papers that day. And everyone got a blast playing with",

          "My husband and I took our 4 daughters here during Spring Break. It was okay. We spent 43.00 to get in and that was with a Military Discount. We stayed and played for 4 hours. There were alot of children there and not any workers in the attraction, so if your child is not a push",
          "A decent place to see various exhibits, especially for kids but admission is pretty steep.",
          "Some of the exhibits are so fun and so cool. Especially the travelling exhibits. However, they do need to pay attention to some of their permanent features. Many of the interactive things were broken and that was kind of a letdown for the kids. but all in all, our family really",
          "We took our 6 and 8 year olds to visit The Exploration Place and they had a fabulous time! We spent about 4 hours there, but they could have stayed longer if we had the time. The only glitch was when we tried to see an IMAX show and instead of viewing the kid-friendly show we",

          "Some people that live around here don't like exploration place but I enjoy it mainly for all the hands on activities. I don't like going to museums and just having to look and read. I love this little water area where you try to build a dam out of sand and just wait till the",

          "Lots of hands on activities, a nice variety of planetarium movies, and a nice miniature golf course! If you have a local family, the passes are an AMAZING deal! We bought a pass and did a little bit each day for several days as an \"interlude\" for the kids.",
          "I went to Exploration Place with my three year old and one year old. I'd been to children's hands on museums before, and I have to say that I was disappointed in this one. The traveling exhibit that was there was boring and not very interesting. It was an Under the Sea type",

          "I was shocked when I saw the state this place was in-- we got there about 30 minutes after opening, so it wasn't like it got filthy over the course of a day. It was filthy from the beginning. In the infant - 3 yr old area, the carpets looked as if they hadn't been vacuumed in",
          "My wife and I took our 11 month old son to Exploration place with not a lot of expectations for things to do with our small son. But what we found was broken toys, broken exhibits, overpriced admission and overall a very disappointing place to represent Wichita. At over 30$ for",
          "My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this exhibit. We spent 2 1/2 hours, going through all 3 crime scences. I've gone on a lot of tours taking students to a local state bureau of investigation lab. This exhibit is pretty realistic.",
          "We'd been to this place a few years ago so were dissappointed to find that the same displays and exhibits were there only some were broken and not working. My grandson is 7 and had an ok time but not spectacular. He was bored with alot of the displays and some of the hands on",
          "The website made this place look awesome. Unfortunately, when my friends and I got there, we were highly disappointed. Everything was directed JUST for much younger children. I was assuming Exploration Place was a science center. It's more like a children's museum IF THAT. My",
          "We live in Wichita and love Exploration Place. It has plenty of interactive stations to keep the kids busy. There is a fun castle with dress up, a tornado simulator, as well as rotating exhibits. Perfect place to take the kids.",
          "I have taken my son to exploration place three times now and each time he has had a blast, it isn't a really big museum but every few months or so they change the area with traveling exibits. So far we have seen waterworks, grossology and one the was about sounds, can't remember",
          "We stopped here briefly and got in free because of our reciprocal membership at another museum. I'm not sure I would pay the $30+ for admission but the kids (ages 5 and 6) enjoyed the short time (a little over an hour) we spent there. Apparently the place has been open about 10",
          "We are members of another Science Center so we get in for free. I am not sure what the admission is but it may be lacking of activities if it is pricey. Worth a stop if you have a membership.",

        "wiki": "Wichita ( WITCH-i-taw) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Sedgwick County. As of 2019, the estimated population of the city was 389,938. Wichita is the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 644,888 in 2018.Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown.\"In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city became an aircraft production hub known as \"The Air Capital of the World.\" Textron Aviation, Learjet, Airbus, and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American aircraft industry. Wichita is also home to McConnell Air Force Base, and Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, the largest airport in Kansas.\nAs an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena and Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center. The city's Old Cowtown Museum maintains historical artifacts and exhibits on the city's early history. Wichita State University is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 B.C. In 1541, a Spanish expedition led by explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the area populated by the Quivira, or Wichita, people. Conflict with the Osage in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to European settlement of the region, the site was in the territory of the Kiowa.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nClaimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it became part of Kansas Territory in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.The Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in Indian Territory by Confederate forces in the American Civil War, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to Texas which became known as the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.In 1868, trader James R. Mead was among a group of investors who established a town company and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and German immigrant William \"Dutch Bill\" Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city's first streets. Wichita formally incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870.\n\nWichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". Across the Arkansas River, the town of Delano became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement. The area had a reputation for violence until local lawmen, Wyatt Earp among them, began to assertively police the cowboys. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to Dodge City. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.Rapid immigration resulted in a speculative land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into Wichita State University, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became Friends University, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after Kansas City and Topeka with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, there were five operating refineries in Wichita with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded Derby Oil, and Fred C. Koch, who established what would become Koch Industries, both began in Wichita during this period.The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited Chicago aircraft builder Emil \"Matty\" Laird to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the Swallow Airplane Company. Two early Swallow employees, Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, Stearman Aircraft in 1926 and Beechcraft in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started his own company in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the \"Air Capital of the World\" in 1929.\n\nOver the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman's Wichita facilities became part of Boeing which would become the city's largest employer. Initial construction of Wichita Municipal Airport finished southeast of the city in 1935. During World War II, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bomber. In 1951, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish McConnell Air Force Base. By 1954, all non-military air traffic had shifted to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport west of the city. In 1962, Lear Jet Corporation opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health care products maker Mentholatum in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping gear retailer Coleman started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of fast food franchises started in Wichita, beginning with White Castle in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including Pizza Hut in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.Wichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous temperance extremist Carrie Nation struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas's prohibition ordinance. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for desegregation. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of George Tiller. Tiller was later killed in Wichita by an extremist in 2009.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nExcept for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to re-develop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. Intrust Bank Arena opened downtown in 2010.Boeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus maintaining facilities in Wichita.Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the Kansas native and U.S. President in 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDowntown Wichita is at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111), at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m). Wichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 54. Part of the Midwestern United States, it is 157 mi (253 km) north of Oklahoma City, 181 mi (291 km) southwest of Kansas City, and 439 mi (707 km) east-southeast of Denver.The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area's topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies Chisholm Creek, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks as well as, further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 163.59 sq mi (423.70 km2), of which 159.29 sq mi (412.56 km2) is land and 4.30 sq mi (11.14 km2) is water.As the core of the Wichita metropolitan area, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, Valley Center, Park City, Kechi, and Bel Aire. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is Eastborough. Adjacent to the city's east side is Andover. McConnell Air Force Base is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, are Derby and Haysville. Goddard and Maize border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWichita lies within the transitional zone of the humid subtropical climate zone and the humid continental climate zone (K\u00f6ppen Cfa/Dfa), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the Great Plains, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer months. These occasionally bring large hail as well as frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history: in September 1965; during the Andover, Kansas Tornado Outbreak of April 1991; and during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s while cold air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0 \u00b0F. Wind speed in the city averages 13 mph (21 km/h). On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and June the wettest.The average temperature in the city is 56.9 \u00b0F (13.8 \u00b0C). Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 32.2 \u00b0F (0.1 \u00b0C) in January to 81.1 \u00b0F (27.3 \u00b0C) in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) an average of 62 days a year and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) on an average 8.5 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was \u221222 \u00b0F (\u221230 \u00b0C) on February 12, 1899. Readings as low as \u221217 \u00b0F (\u221227 \u00b0C) and as high as 111 \u00b0F (44 \u00b0C) occurred as recently as February 10, 2011 and July 29\u201330, 2012, respectively. Wichita receives on average about 32.69 inches (830 mm) of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 88 days of measurable precipitation. The average relative humidity is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages 15.6 inches (40 cm). Measurable snowfall occurs an average of ten days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on five of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 15 days a year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 26 through April 11.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nWichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The downtown area is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the Epic Center. Old Town is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.\nTwo notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the 120-acre (0.49 km2) Riverside Park. upscale College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city.Four other historic neighborhoods\u2014developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near Boeing, Cessna and Beech aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary World War II housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 51st largest city in the United States. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,304.8 per square mile (889.9/km2). There were 167,310 housing units at an average density of 1,022.1 per square mile (475.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% White, 11.5% African American, 4.8% Asian, 1.2% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 15.3% of the population.Of the 151,818 households, 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a male householder with no wife present, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families. 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48, and the average family size was 3.14.The median age in the city was 33.9 years. 26.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.The median income for a household in the city was $44,477, and the median income for a family was $57,088. Males had a median income of $42,783 versus $32,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,517. About 12.1% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nWichita is the principal city of both the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Wichita-Winfield Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, Butler, Harvey, and Sumner counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.The larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes Cowley County and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby Reno County is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIt is the birthplace of famous restaurants such as White Castle and Pizza Hut. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top 25 Kansas-based brands such as Koch, Coleman, Cessna, Pizza Hut, Beechcraft, Freddy's and more are based in Wichita.Wichita's principal industrial sector is manufacturing, which accounted for 21.6 percent of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.Healthcare is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing approximately 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical care tower at Wesley Medical Center. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system's fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children's Hospital, the first and only children's hospital in the Wichita area.Thanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring Butler County, Kansas, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former Derby Oil Company, which was purchased by Coastal Corporation in 1988. Wichita is home to oil & natural gas organizations Kansas Strong and Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association (KIOGA)\nKoch Industries and Cargill, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. Cargill Meat Solutions Div., at one time the nation's 3rd-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer Chance Morgan, gourmet food retailer Dean & Deluca, renewable energy company Alternative Energy Solutions, and Coleman Company, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies.

In July 2006, CNN/Money and Money ranked Wichita ninth on their list of the 10 best U.S. big cities in which to live.  In 2008, MSN Real Estate ranked Wichita 1st on its list of most affordable cities.  Wichita was also named the most \"Uniquely American\" city by Newsmax magazine in a May 2009 piece written by Peter Greenberg.  However, in its 2019 \"Best Places to Live\" survey, U. S. News & World Report, ranked Wichita at #79 out of 125 U.S. cities, and noted that violent crime in Wichita had risen over the previous few years.  In the 2019 KIDS COUNT Data Book, in its annual \"State Rankings on Overall Child Well-Being,\" Kansas was ranked No. 15 out of the 50 states. However, the state has a significantly higher rate of child incarceration than the nation, generally, and a higher rate of the state taking children from their homes.\n\n\n=== Aircraft manufacturing ===\n\nFrom the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, \"Matty\" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, Al Mooney and Bill Lear began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that would lead to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations E. M. Laird Aviation Company (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), Travel Air (started by Beech, Stearman and Cessna), Stearman, Cessna, Beechcraft and Mooney were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932.  By 1931, Boeing (of Seattle, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating \"Boeing-Wichita\", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita having merged into Textron Aviation in 2014, along with Learjet and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and Bombardier (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to depress the aviation sub-sector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., Hawker Beechcraft and Raytheon Aircraft Co.\u2014to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users. In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine light aircraft to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for Spirit Aerosystems to open its plant.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nWichita has a complex cultural mix, dominated by Euro-American, blue-collar industrial and rural tastes, but embracing, to various degrees, classical arts and music, diverse domestic and foreign cultures (Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian, British and Irish cultural influences and activities are conspicuous), and avant garde cultural activity.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nWichita is a cultural center for Kansas, home to several art museums and performing arts groups.

          "We're art lovers. I love that this museum is family friendly. We could spend hours here with our family and never feel bored. There's a food court, a children's area that is spacious and filled with neat areas for kids to explore, play and create. The best part is that at least",

This museum is a member of the American Alliance of Museums, but is not accredited by the organization.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum first opened as the Museum of Ancient Treasures on April 22, 2001, at the Garvey Building in Downtown Wichita. The bulk of the exhibits were originally from the collection of the museum's founder, Dr. Jon Kardatzke. As the Museum of Ancient Treasures began to attract more visitors, it asserted its dedication to serving and educating the community of Wichita. In the process, the museum began to attract more lifetime collectors who shared Kardatzke's passion for history; realizing the scope and aim of the museum, the collectors were honored to display their collections there. \nIn less than a year, the size and diversity of the museum's collection had changed. It now consisted of over 30 individual private collections, and spanned numerous significant events and cultures from prehistory to the present. Spurred by the purchase of three complete fossil dinosaur skeletons, the museum was forced to look for a larger space to exhibit its vast and growing collection. \nThe museum relocated to the \"Farm and Art Market\" in Old Town, Wichita, in 2003 and was renamed The Museum of World Treasures. The new location is a reconstructed three story warehouse that was completely renovated to house the expansive museum collection.  \nThere have now been over 300 collectors who have their items stored and on display as loans or donations at the Museum. The museum owns approximately 75% of the artifacts\n\n\n== Mission ==\nTo provide a gateway to the past that educates, entertains and inspires lifelong learning.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe three stories of the museum contain a diverse array of historical artifacts.

          "Dinosaurs, presidents, mummy artifacts, Buddha\u2019s, Mayan artifacts and so many pictures, and information on the World wars , Korean War and the Vietnam war. I saw more and learned more about all of these wars than I ever did in a history book! Pictures, and information clear and",
          "This museum is more like a random collectors place. The dinosaurs are the best of the bunch and well displayed at labelled, so is the Roman coin collection. Much of the rest feels kind of random - some Egyptian mummies, some buddha statues, some ancient pottery. Interesting",
          "This museum has a lot to offer for everyone. From dinosaurs to U.S. Presidents. The section of the Berlin Wall was very moving in my opinion. The mummies and the ancient history of the Greeks and Roman Empires and a very large section of Chinese marble Buddha's. The Civil war,",
          "They have a hugh assortment of things. The whole family liked it. We did not see the 3rd floor, we ran out of time. One in the family likes to read everything. That will take more than 2 hours. The history and fun facts are great.",

          "We enjoyed and afternoon at the museum. I called it the museum of the world. It really has something for everyone. The exhibits are in depth. We only spent time on the second floor. We did not get through all of it. We can save that for another visit.",

          "The museum has a lot of different historic artifacts. From very early statues, coins, mummies to the great wars in the 1900s. A little of a lot of historically events and things to read about things and photos. We thought it was fun and interesting as well as educational. The",
          "The Museum is home to many stories and artifacts from around the world. From Sabertooth tigers to WW1 artifacts, this place is perfect for trips with people of all ages. It also happens to be in the cities center with multiple local restaurants and breweries within walking",
          "This is a fantastic little museum! My son and I enjoyed it so much, we came to see the mummies and we're not disappointed. Friendly staff, and very well kept place",
          "It\u2019s spring break and so we are visiting the local attractions in our home city. I have two kids, 7&10, once works hard to focus and the other loves history and reading every plaque. That being said, this place kept both of my kids entertained and we spent two hours going",
          "We have visited the Museum of World Treasures several times and have learned something new every visit. Each floor is dedicated to different time periods. Our favorite happens to be the Egyptian on the 1st. Highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Wichita. It's",
          "Great place to bring out of towers! Very fun and more educational! A great place to bring the kids when weather isn't up to par to be outdoors!!",
          "A real gem! My wife and I took our 6 & 4 year old grandkids and we all had a great time. Well done, staff members! Now, my wife and I intend to return so WE can see the parts young children wouldn\u2019t find interesting. Parts of it bring home Kansas\u2019 ancient history ever so more",
          "This is a very great place to take a first date or even take your loved one to that you have been with for a long time. I would reconmend taking the backstage tour as it is very informative and gives you a look at a lot of the projects that they are currently working on as well.",
          "Alot of history. I have not been any where else but I thought there was alot of old and interesting artifacts. It's sectioned off in eras which I found very helpful. I am not a big museum person but I would go back.",
          "The name of this museum says it all, as it has exhibits from a bunch of different aspects of the world. Dinosaurs and other similar extinct species, rocks and minerals, religious artifacts from Buddhism and Hinduism, ancient Roman, Greek, and Egyptian coins and other things, and",
          "A great museum - eclectic artifacts! A great family museum! There are so many presidential and US historical artifacts, and the mummy section is so interesting!",
          "This may be one of the most interesting museums you will ever visit. It started out as a private collection and grew to take up a city block. You'll see everything from a mummy to a dinosaur to guns shot by Jessie James. You will NOT get bored in this place. It's fun, it's",
          "We spent a rainy afternoon in Wichita Kansas at the Museum of World Treasures. Loved the dinosaurs and the fish skeletons. Their civil war section was interesting. I live in the west, so we do not get many artifacts to view in the museums there. I could have spent more time",
          "We have been to a lot of museums but none as fascinating as this one. Everything from life size dinosaurs through all periods of time to the present. Each area has so many cool and interesting pieces. Stephanie was our tour guide and she was very knowledgeable. She had many",
          "Wow! We weren't expecting a museum like this one in Wichita. Very impressive display of artifacts. There is a little something for everyone in this place. Fantastic use of an old downtown building. I was also excited at all the free parking in the City. That's unheard of in this",
          "We had a wonderful time strolling through the museum, lots to see and something new around each corner. Yes they have great dinosaurs, mummies . Many surprises and we had a great day . This place is a MUST see. Great job . The staff were great, friendly and could answer",
          "My grandson loved the dinosaurs and the kids play area on the third floor. He is only four so the wonderful history and displays held no interest for him. I look forward to returning when he is older.",
          "The history of the world, beginnings of religions, U.S. wars, and especially American founding and leadership are covered in depth. Unfortunately, it is all comprehensive written descriptions. You have to like to read to appreciate this museum. Additionally, it stops at the",
          "My granddaughter and I recently visited the museum and spent a couple of hours. A fun way to explore the museum is to pick up an age appropriate scavenger hunt. When you enter, there are pencils and paper with clues to find about 12 items as you explore. It gave my",
          "This place is awesome! Every few steps you're entering a whole new world. I was very impressed by the caliber of artifacts they had (two real mummies from Egypt, seriously?!) and was fascinated by every room. Upstairs has rooms on pretty much every war America has been involved",
          "Really neat place ! Lots of interesting things and artifacts!! You will definitely learn a thing or two!",

          "A Museum of World Treaures it is not. It is an odd and eclectic collection that is of some interest. It has a very old world thrown together look about it. I walked away not really knowing how to feel, in some ways it is a chessy mishmash, however, it is also an interesting",
          "Not really about treasure, but more of an eclectic mix of exhibits from different points in history. A lot of focus was on conflicts the US took a part in.",
          "We enjoyed the few hours we spent here. If you don't read anything you could get thru in an hour or less, but there is a LOT of literature on mostly every single item so it's a great place to learn some facts! There are 3 floors with many interesting items.",
          "Ivan (the T-Rex) is such a treat to see. And it is easy to only review this dinosaurs, but the rest of the exhibits are perfect for getting lost in history as well! I am normally not a big fan of war exhibits, but they had theirs laid out in chronological order so it was not",
          "This museum has the most complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton in the world. Even parts of its breastplate are there! The dinosaur exhibit includes a smaller, and earlier, meat-eater, about the size of a small Allosaurus. Several plant-eaters are there too. All of them are mounted",
          "This was a very nice museum for the area. Having been to many museum and spending time in the Smithsonian i thought the exhibits were quite nice. Staff was very helpful and educators received free admission. Very eclectic variety of items. Some were impressive for the size of",
          "We visited the Museum of World Treasures on a short trip to Wichita and it was delightful. The dinosaur and fossils exhibit is very well presented. The Egyptian exhibit has mummies and wonderful artifacts. The second floor might have been the highlight of the museum for us. It",
          "We had very limited time to visit this museum, so we made a quick run through. Most impressive to us were the dinosaur displays and fossils. They were massive and a little bit scary but amazingly realistic! The museum map is very helpful and everything is organized",
          "I'm not particularly cheap, however I'm not willing to spend stupid money. I unfortunately arrived 32 minutes before closing and they said myself as a disabled senior, my business partner a disabled Senior and my spouse all had to pay full price for a 32 minute visit.",
          "We went to this museum for a quick day trip. It was very well organized and had a lot of really neat exhibits. It has something for everyone and even has a kids area complete with a puppet theater and a costume closet with \u201csets\u201d for kids to act on stage. It was an overall",
          "great exhibits at minimal cost, a truly enjoyable afternoon. The presidents exhibit was memorable and the pieces from the far east made the visit worthwhile on their own.",
          "This museum was unique in all it had to offer. There is something for everybody from old to young to young at heart. Three stories of history from around the globe and plenty of American history. We spent an afternoon leisurely walking through the exhibits and were fascinated",
          "I have been to the best museums around the world including The Cairo Museum, the British Museum, many of the Smithsonians, the Vatican Museum, The Louvre, Gettysburg and many smaller less notable Museums. The truth is most of what you see at many museums are reproductions.",
          "As we were walking up the building I was a tad skeptical of what type of museum this would be. Once we were inside you literally cannot turn a corner without finding something neat. There is just so much to see, learn about, read, interact with, and be fascinated by that",
          "This place is so big. Bring comfortable shoes and eat your wheaties! There are so many artifacts and art pieces to take in. Very informative exhibits. Fairly close by parking and tons to do around the area if you have the energy left after going through",

          "This small museum is full of historical artifacts, starting with dinosaur skeletons found in Kansas, Egyptian mummies, pottery from various cultures and ages, and a massive collection of war artifacts from multiple American wars. I thoroughly enjoyed the first floor of the",
          "This little museum was pretty cool. I wasn\u2019t expecting much. But they had some interesting items and I learned some new things. I recommend it.",
          "Located in old town, this restaurant is a true jewel. Admission is $9.95, but spring for a behind-the-scenes tour for an additional $5 and you won't be sorry. The museum is three floors, filled with great items on display. Hubby and I especially enjoyed the Civil War display",
          "The assortment of artifacts they have collected are very interesting and impressive. They have two mummies from ancient Egypt, coins from almost every Roman emperor, and lots, lots more. The floor related to the United States was somewhat less impressive than the top floor, but",
          "The museum itself is fantastic: tons of interesting items and displays, from dinosaurs to the Korean War. But what really stood out was the fantastic staff. We took the free tour with Stephanie, who was truly wonderful. She was informed and engaging, and she stayed with us for",
          "My college age children and I really enjoyed exploring the vast array of treasures. Fun to see displays from prehistoric all the way to modern historical. Very interesting.",
          "This museum was easily the best experience we had on our Kansas/Oklahoma trip. Because the museum is made up of items from people's personal collections, there isn't any filler stuff like you get at most museums. Every item is fascinating. We travel for work and usually visit at",
          "We came here mostly because the weather was a cold day with flurries which made the zoo not feasible with 3 under 6. There\u2019s so much variety from Dinosaur fossils, ancient culture artifacts like Roman, Egyptian, etc., military artifacts and old west things that you can find",
          "This museum has a little bit of everything. We really enjoyed the mummy! There is something for everyone here no matter what your age. It's in a revitalized area called Old Town. You can walk to go get something to eat and look in specialty shops. If your of legal age, there's",
          "There are cool things to look at. There is also a scavenger hunt (you don't get a prize at the end) that a family could do together. My family did that and it was super fun. Just going through and reading about all of the displays was super cool and great for kids to learn about",
          "This is a great place to visit. It is good for families. It is nice that you can pay admission and it is good all day.",
          "This is a nice museum that have a little bit of everything, from fossils of dinossaur, mumies, war history and even a part of the Berlin Wall. In the last floor there is a space for kids to play and do some artcraft. There are many restaurants near the Museum and you can get out",
          "Visited during spring break with two 12 yr olds, a 10, 5, 4 & 2 yr olds. I cant wait to visit again and bring my 88 yr old grandpa. There is truly something for everyone. I love that the museum is eclectic. Dinosaur fossils, war artifacts, egyptian mummies, and a large play",
          "We spent 3 hours and didn\u2019t see nearly everything. There is quite a bit of reading, but there is so much variety that it would be hard to not find something that interests everyone. We also did the behind the scenes tour, which was a great deal for the price.",
          "We were visiting Wichita for the day, and happened on this museum. There are definitely a wealth of treasures here from Egyptian mummies, dinosaur skeletons, war memorabilia. Definitely worth the time.",
          "My boyfriend and I did a tour with Stephanie at the Museum of World Treasures! She was fun, energetic and informative!! This is the second time visiting and had a great time!!",
          "I was a little worried that this museum was going to be \"tourist trappy\", but I was pleasantly surprised that it was very good. We came 2 hours before they closed, so we zoomed through it. If we went earlier we probably could have spent another hour there. Price was reasonable",
          "This place is really cool. They have a ton of stuff for such a small place, and I was told that's about 25% of the entire collection! They really should find a bigger building. The first floor is all about history, with mostly complete dinosaur skeletons, and artifacts from",
          "There's something for everyone at the Museum of World Treasures. Dinosaur fossils, historical memorabilia from most of the major Wars There's a fantastic Egyptian exhibition, copy of the presidential Resolute desk, Greek pottery, Roman coins. This is a diverse collection of",
          "Good place to spend an hour or two if you like history of the world. I was surprised by magnitude of artifacts from dinosaur bones to ancient China artifacts to Berlin Wall. This place has a little bit of everything and gift shop was as good as museum itself.",
          "My husband and I visited the museum recently and we enjoyed it. There is a lot of information that I think would bore smaller children. Most of the exhibits are heavy with reading, rather than pictures and/or interactive exhibits. There is a small place upstairs for children to",
          "Once a month there is a morning coffee meeting on the 3rd floor. Cost is $4 as I recall. They offer varied topics.For example, the last was on Maryland Quaker women in the 1600 and 1700\u2019s. Presented by a history professor from Emporia State. Who\u2019d have thought we\u2019d have learned",
          "The Museum of World Treasures is really fantastic. The displays and artifacts are amazing. From the dinosaur bones to the Presidential items, all I can say is wow. The museum is 3 stories of wow. Access is easy for all. There is even a childrens' room on the 3rd floor. The",
          "They have a wide variety of displays here. Definitely worth a visit if you are into history. Lots of war history items. From the civil war forward. Numerous dinosaur fossils. We had a catered dinner on the top floor.",
          "from the t-rex to the mummies the place will amaze you. shrunken head will shock you, especially when they tell you how it is done. the staff are knowledgeable and very friendly.",
          "What an interesting place to visit! I really enjoyed the fossils, the WWII exhibit, and the authentic letters written by famous folks. You can spend a lot of time here, if you wish, or just peruse the items that interest you.",
          "Not a huge place, but some very cool treasures inside. Very cool to see a piece of the Berlin Wall among other historic pieces and artifacts.",
          "The Museum of World Treasures is a wonderful place to visit. It is small but full of treasures. My son and daughter in law had their wedding and reception there. It was a fairly small wedding but the Museum offers a section of the Museum to be used and part of the cost",
          "A great gem in Wichita! Not so big it's overwhelming, but plenty to grab the attention of all ages! Nice gift shop also.",
          "I was very pleasantly surprised to see so many wonderful artifacts in Kansas! My favorite parts were the ancient Greek pottery and Egyption mummies, however there are lots of things to see. There are things like Alexander Hamilton's coat, dinosaur bones, and ancient Roman",
          "We were very impressed by the amount of artifacts available. Everything from dinosaurs, fossil, mummies, lots of war artifacts. Nice kid's play area. Very glad we made time for this. The free 30 min tour was very informative.",
          "My daughter loves museums so we tend to go to many. This one had some neat exhibits but seemed average as far as size and some areas weren't in viewing/working order. The staff was nice and it wasn't crowded. We spent around 1 1/2 hours at the museum.",
          "I was completely taken by surprise by the delightfulness of this museum. The name makes it sound like Ripley's odd artifacts, but that's not it at all. Museum is arranged chronologically from antiquity to modern times on several floors, so I would call it a history museum.",
          "Was a little surprised by the range of exhibits here - geology to dinosaurs, to mummies, to a shrunken head, to American history. We enjoyed ourselves and learnt many interesting facts during our visit.",
          "This is a great museum. It has something for everyone...natural history, prehistory (Rome, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Africa, Near East), Americans history (Revolutionary War, Civil War, WW1, WW2, Korea, and Vietnam, the Old West, etc.), fossils (including dinosaurs!), geology...three",
          "It is hard to believe a private museum hidden in the middle of Old Towne here in Wichita would have the wide variety and depth of artifacts ranging from prehistoric fossils to presidential letters. There was plenty to interest the 14 and 10 year old grandkids we spent the day",
          "We had a great experience here! The exhibits are so great and there is so much to see and read. Although it is small, it is certainly worth the time. The Civil War exhibit was my favorite. Every staff member we saw was so helpful and wonderful. I definitely recommend a trip!",
          "Way bigger than we expected. The variety of exhibits is astounding. The mummies are a MUST SEE. It feels like a Cliff\u2019s notes version of the Smithsonian. Well worth the $8 admission.",
          "We took the grandkid & had a good time. It was military week & there were reenactment folks dressed up for the different wars. Military exhibit was awesome to a veteran such as myself. All wars were covered & they had military dress & weapons for each war as well as good",
          "This museum had a variety of interesting exhibits. They offer a scavenger hunt that kept my 9 and 12 year old boys interested throughout the museum. They got to pick a little prize out at the end for completing it. The mummies and ancient Egyptian and European artifacts were",
          "There's a lot of unique items in this place and interesting factoids of every item you pass by. I have always been intrigued by ancient Egypt and this exhibit was exactly what I was looking for find. The only reason why I do not give it 5 stars is because they had a section",
          "The little brochure and listing that I saw just told a small part of the story on what is on display! It talked about the dinosaurs, military, and Hollywood and sports memorabilia, but the size of the collections is really big. And I must mention the detailed signs on the walls",
          "Museum of World Treasures has it all. Mummies, fossils, memorabilia, war, and the list goes on. I really wanted to see the fossils and some of the morbid stuff, out of curiosity and was surprised by the diversity shown in this museum. There are three levels here, all with",
          "From the TRex to the mummies this place is great. My wife didn't believe the mummies wrre real, but tbey are. Fun and educational.",
          "Although the museum is small, it is filled with so many different kinds of treasures like dinosaur skeletons, many of which were found locally. There were mummies, civil war displays, Chinese art and coffins and pictures with life stories of so many people like Alexander",
          "I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this museum. There are a 3 floors of exhibits and include a variety of things ranging from dinosaurs, minerals, artifacts from ancient Rome, Greece, South America, Egypt, Asia, memorabilia from various wars and some art as well. The",
          "From the entrance through the years and layers of history in a beautiful multi story down town building. A worthwhile experience. A full tour or just a few hours is rewarding.",
          "We took a five year old and he really liked the dinosaurs. He made a mask, talked to a real jousters and played pirate in the children's play area. There was an area about old movies and information about the Berlin Wall.",
          "Visited here whilst on a business trip. Very nice diversion for a few hours. The first floor houses dinosaur bones and roman and Egyptian artefacts. My favourite was the second floor which had a history of the colonies, war of independence and all of the presidents. As a",
          "I go each year with my grandchildren and the history from ww1 and the old west is super. Not very expensive an just good to see exhibits from days gone by.",
          "This museum really has something for everyone and you could easily spend several days going through all of the exhibits here. The museum has also started hosting some spotlight events that seem interesting and are hopefully helping the museum increase visitation. If anyone",
          "This museum has a little bit of everything. They have Ivan the T-Rex, mummies, some of Marilyn Monroe's items, things from the old west, and an awesome collection of ancient jewelry. Of course there is so much more too! And they host unique events. A huge benefit is also their",
          "This museum has a little bit of everything, but the things they have are great! From dinosaur skeletons, to shrunken heads, to war uniforms and memorabilia - it has it all. Great way to spend a couple of hours!",
          "So I'll admit that I'm not into museums, but having said that, I thoroughly have enjoy visiting this one a couple of times. My favorite part is the Old West area where the lives of ol' cowboys (and a couple of cowgirls) are showcased,",
          "My husband and I stopped in this morning and were greatly impressed with this museum! For the price of only $8.95, there is three floors of artifacts which include topics such as, the world wars, civil war, dinosaurs, Egyptian era, etc. my favorite artifact was the actual mummy!",
          "We had a GREAT time! So many floors and things to see. What a great learning experience for all. Would definitely recommend for singles, couples and families.",
          "The museum is very interesting and a great place to spend a little time. It is very conveniently located right in Old Town so you can park in one spot and shop or dine without moving your car. The museum also has a good array of different exhibits to see. Worth a visit.",
          "My husband, thirteen year old, and ten year old loved this museum!!!! They saw unique artifacts including dinosaurs, world cultures, Buddha statues...so much more. The ticket is good for the day, so you can leave for lunch and return to explore more.",
          "If you love the history of US wars, this is the place for you. Seemed a bit disorganized with the \"flow\" of the museum, but there was a lot to see. Disappointed with some of the advertised exhibits as I expected to see more. For example, the sports part is one room with",
          "This is an interesting little history museum. It is three stories, and they have dinosaur skeletons, mummies, Etruscan artifacts, as well as some local history. It is a natural history museum, so young children may not enjoy it.",
          "This was a really good Museum. Enjoyed seeing a lot of the artifacts. If you work to stop and read all the information you would spend a good half a day in that museum.",
          "Amazing that we have this kind of museum here in Wichita! Very interesting and educational. So many artifacts, fossils and historical pieces. I know my eight year old grandson would love the dinosaurs & mummies. All of our schools should be bringing students here. A great",
          "Could have spent the whole day here, if we had more time. The second floor was amazing!! Thought we would just stop for an hour at the end of a day. We were wrong, there is so much to see and read. Will definitely be back!!!",
          "I have three big complaints about the museum. The first is that there is no obvious planned path of travel throughout the exhibits, so it's difficult to experience the exhibits from beginning to end without a lot of backtracking. The second is that the collection is not very",
          "As we walked in, my wife and I both got the sense that we would be in and out in 45 minutes. The museum seemed small and it looked like investment in museum display areas was minimal. We left, reluctantly, after three hours. While it's not a huge space, it's packed full of",
          "Wonderful and varied collections of different epochs of world history, including fossils, Egypt, and American presidents as a few examples. An intellectual delight. If you don't care, don't go. Well worth planning to take your time to enjoy.",
          "This was on my main list to visit when we got to Wichita. I had high expectations but was let down. The museum did have some nice items but the layout was rather confusing and there was a lot of updating that is needed. Children easily get bored. I noticed a lot of dust",
          "If it wasn't for the T-Rex this place would be a complete waste of time. It's also expensive for the quality of entertainment.",
          "Spent about 3 hours here on a hot day. Too hot to be outside. Very interesting. Had a little of everything from dinosaurs to Egyptian. Even had two mummies on display. Very well done display on all the US wars. Well worth the visit.",
          "They have so many things to see here, from dinosaurs and mummies, to Buddha and war memorabilia. I was impressed how much they have in the space, it just kept going. Loved the dinosaurs and the mummies and shrunken head the most.",
          "We couldn't spend as much time as we wanted due to us not planning our time correctly. When they tell you it should take 1-2 hrs, they mean it. You can't just walk by without stopping and examining each artifact. There is a wide variety, not just one point of interest. Great",
          "This is the steal of all attractions in Kansas. You absolutely must find the time to visit. This three-story museum is so meticulously organized and put together with hundreds, if not thousands, of artifacts that it feels like a museum you would find in New York, Chicago, or",
          "We could have spent 8 hours in this place and never be bored of uninterested. The uniqueness of different cultures and displays was great! We loved it!",
          "This is a great museum and has a little of everything from Dinosaurs to Presidents. Three floors of items and could easily spend several hours or days in the museum.",
          "I spent a couple of hours visiting this small museum in Wichita. It's three floors but only two really have much to see. I have never been to a museum with so many guns as exhibitions before, but the fossils and Roman leaders were pretty good. It was a nice way to get out of the",
          "Interesting little spot in wichita's historic Old Town , located in the Central Business District, with artifacts and treasures from Kansas and around the world. There are several floors to this small museum but there are elevators and fully accessible for families with small",
          "I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this wonderful Museum in the centre of the Old Town. It takes you through virtually every period of History with World Class exhibits. My only regret was that we only had a couple of hours to spare and never made it to the top floor.",
          "We toured the museum on a Friday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised. I wish I had more time to read all the info about each American President. We had a great time!",
          "We are always looking for new things to do and this hidden treasure has been right under our nose for years. We had never heard of it and decided to go and see. We took friends from out of town and they, along with us, were very impressed with the variety and amount of things",
          "My husband and I really enjoyed our visit to the Museum of World Treasures. Unfortunately as we were passing through we were short on time and could easily have spent longer looking at the huge variety of items on display. We particularly liked the section covering all the",
          "I enjoyed this museum very much. Lots of interesting exhibits I haven't seen at other museums. We had a great time, at a great price!",
          "My husband and I really enjoyed our visit to the Museum of World Treasures. The exhibits were interesting and had detailed information regarding each exhibit. Our teenage son enjoyed browsing through the displays, but our seven year old lost interest after the first floor. She's",
          "This place is amazing. You get to see actual mummies (which actually kinda freaked me out), and the history and relics they have is fantastic. I recommend this to everyone! Since it's in Old Town you have plenty of places to eat at when you're done. Most within a block.",
          "Very interesting, nicely planned museum in a fun part of town. Don't miss the mummies, kind of weird but cool to see.",
          "Our daughter had her wedding reception in their venue. It was a great, centrally located place to have a reception. They set up tables and put out table clothes for us. While the bride and groom were having pix taken the guests could walk through the collections. It was a",
          "Too much \"stuff\" makes it look like someone cleaned out their high-school collection of trophies, etc..interesting displays ..lots to see...need extra time to truly enjoy...lots of close by features eg. restaurants and shops and of course, the Warren Theatre!",
          "The first floor alone was great. The 2nd floor is a whole different world. Plan to spend a few hours. Suggest picking the areas that are of most interest and focus on those first. There are exhibits in every nook and cranny - including the hallway to the rest rooms. Really",
          "We came here after Mass at Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on Sunday, April 2, 2017. Wonderful collection of dinosaur fossils, antiquities, wartime memorabilia and even a section of the Berlin Wall. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to MOWT in Wichita!",
          "This museum has a little bit of everything. There's dinosaur fossils, Egyptian sarcophagus, Buddha statues, movie memorabilia war artifacts, and even a shrunken head. Lots of hands on exhibits for the kiddos. Main floor needs to be redone. Its not very organized. A bit",
          "The kids did the treasure hunt which kept them interested and occupied in the items. The prize they received was not that cool, but it was a neat place",
          "This is a wonderful museum to visit. It is not a specialty museum; it is far more like our knowledge, experience, and the ways we learn\u2014a bit here, a piece there, a chunk now, an insight later. It has over 3000 items. I especially enjoyed the piece of the Berlin Wall, a great",
          "We went sure what to expect here but the museum was extremely interesting and has lots to share!! So many great displays and it is quite diverse! Loved it!!",
          "Family of 5 this time. Kids looked this place up on web and wanted to visit. Great variety of artifacts. HUGE area of military stuff. Very small area for sports. Mummies were neat. Dinosaurs were a favorite for the kids.",
          "A hodgepodge collection. The first floor was definitely the most interesting for my family. My granddaughter enjoyed doing the scavenger hunt. Nice Old Town location.",
          "Cool museum lots of neat things to look at and even some hands on for the kids , value priced even open on Sundays",
          "Many people come to Wichita for business and pleasure. As a long time resident they ask me what is fun to do here. I always recommend the Museum of World Treasures It is in Old Towne and the 3 stories hold a diverse collection of museum pieces from dinosaurs, Civil War, WWI,",
          "Read some reviews and decided to give it a try. Three story building housing a lot of different sections (dinosaurs,WWI,WWII,vietnam, Korean wars, Egyptians,ETC). Kid Friendly with hands on attractions",
          "This museum is worth traveling to see. I would recommend this over many larger museums in larger cities. There is a fantastic collection of artifacts here. There's plenty to see for all ages, but also a document area that kids will likely be bored by. This is a must see.",
          "This museum is really cool. A very eclectic mix of artifacts, from Dinosaur bones to real mummies and shrunken heads, to movie artifacts and pieces of literary history. We very much enjoyed this museum. Make sure you have a few hours to enjoy it all!",
          "This place was quite the adventure for sure! My husband and I wanted to see what this place was all about and boy did we learn a lot! There are 3 levels to this museum and it covers everything from the dinosaurs to the modern day. We spent about 3 hours there and even skipped",
          "i have lived in Wichita for nearly 17 years, and just recently went to visit this museum. i was certainly pleasantly surprised! yes, it's small, but it really has something from most corners of the world! i definitely learned a thing or two that day! revisited a week later with",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here. There are pieces from various periods of time including some prehistoric exhibits. It's a bit small so take your time because it's easy to miss stuff in those tight spaces. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We are considering a",
          "Our last stop in the Hall of Presidents was the most fun. You may want to see it first. From Washington to Obama there are excerpts of their terms, famous documents and wise or outrageously funny quotes.",
          "Could have spent all day touring the 3 floors of museum. Everything from the dinosaur age, Roman , Greek, Oriental, Egyptian, American history - can 't recall all. Third floor seemed work in progress as switched to music , American cowboys, gangsters, authors - all in all",
          "Something for everyone to see and nerd out about. Parents got their pictures done in front of the red curtains between two armored knights. We loved the first floor, dad appreciated the second floor being an army veteran. If you have little ones I guess there would be something",
          "Really neat museum. Really cool to see all the different eras that were represented by all the artifacts. I took my two young nieces and they enjoyed have I ng the scavenger hunt to find all the different objects which kept them into the museum. There were different hunts for",
          "My 12 year old niece requested that we go here. She had been before in a school field trip. Nice variety of museum pieces with appropriate signage to explain. From fossils to Egyptology to multiple wars, this is big enough to inform but not so big as to bore kids to death.",
          "I went with my son on his school trip! I think I had more fun than the kids. It was just so neat to see all of the world treasures they had inside. I had no idea. I loved it would definitely recommend going!!!",
          "Very interesting museum which some unusual artifacts. This museum is located in a revitalized area of downtown Wichita and is close to all the other museums. Is close to many restaurants. This museum is probably better suited for teenagers than younger children. It was a good",
          "This was such a nice surprise this museum was right across from our hotel. We were there for a couple hours wandering through seeing all kinds of interesting treasures. Very well put together for the price of admission. Was very nice. I would recommend this museum to anyone.",
          "We visited the Museum of World Treasurers in Wichita, KS and found 3 floors of very interesting exhibits. There were fossils and dinosaur remains, Egyptian treasures and mummies, Roman antiquities, WW I and II exhibits, Presidential exhibits, a piece of the Berlin wall and so",
          "Interesting museum ! Lots of interesting items but the museum is more of a collection of stuff than a museum. Don't get me wrong. It's interesting stuff. Nice way to kill time in Wichita.",
          "Well this place was a bit of a let down. Lots and lots of stuff to see, but kinda disjointed. It seemed like random stuff here and there with little groups of like items. I'd say this place was so-so.",
          "This isn't the most awesome museum I've ever visited, but they had a wide variety of things to look at and it was a fun way to spend a few hours. Some of it was a little confusing with the history aspects, but if you just want to look at the artifacts, you'll like it.",
          "This was an interesting place to visit with an assortment of items to view and get to understand more of the history around us! Because of the displays the Muesum is kept cooler than I had expected and should have worn a light jacket!",
          "They have a little bit of everything. A wonderful assortment of dinosaur fossils, old budda statues, relics from the Roman age, Mayan and Inca, a great military section, etc. Great for all ages",
          "Surprisingly good. I went as this was across the road from my hotel and had no expectations. Thematic and wide ranging exhibits would be perfect for school trips. I was there on my own and enjoyed the dinaosaurs (including the enormous T Rex), the film memorabilia and the",
          "If you find yourself in Wichita with time to explore this is a must see! The entry price is very reasonable for all this museum has to offer...We wish we would have gotten there a little earlier so we could have spent more time... With 3 floors to explore there is something for",
          "Great place for date night or affordable to take the kids...They have real mummies and Ivan is awesome!",
          "I took the grandchildren here on a rainy afternoon just for something to do. We were pleasantly surprised at the number, quality and dversity of the exhibits. THis is a great place to help history live for young minds.",
          "A great experience, I could see many things like mummies, heads and much more. It is crime not to visit it when in Wichita",
          "Dinosaurs mummies civil war oh my! A little bit of everything. Fascinating place. Learned some new things. Great place to take the kiddos. There's something for people of all ages to enjoy. Never knew this lil gem was here. Glad i visited you should as well.",
          "Presidential display was great with quotes from all of them. Custers underwear were their.. Mickey Mouse of the plains were in display.",
          "I have been to the Old Town for years, and finally got a chance to see the inside of the place. The place is quirky because of the layout and what they offer. That doesn't make any less entertainment. For example the 2nd floor had several American war history but unlike most",
          "It is a relatively small building to be billed as a \"Museum of World Treasures.\" You know what though? They have something from almost all the continents and all the time periods. My friends and I learned a great deal. The exhibits are interesting and user-friendly. There",
          "On our first visit, we had no idea what to expect, but within minutes we understood the name. There are, indeed, treasures from around the world and a variety of subjects and time periods. One could easily spend hours here and still not see everything.",
          "They have a little bit of everything here. First floor has a lot of ancient world artifacts from the Egyptians through early Central American cultures, Buddha statues, Greek and Roman era coins etc. Has a nice geology section and dinosaurs fossils etc. Kids would probably like",
          "My wife wanted to visit this museum. I thought it would be boring. However, there are some very interesting artifacts inside. we both enjoyed it. I believe it was a little more costly than it needed to be.",
          "This is a very good museum. The museum has a lot of items larger museums have. The museum is in the heart of Wicjita's old down town with many neat restaurants and shopping.",
          "This museum is wonderful!! Wichita is so lucky to have it located here. There are dinosaurs, mummies, war items. So many things that you will want to take your time viewing things. My kids also love it. We have been many times.",
          "You wouldn't expect Wichita to have such an eclectic museum. A very large dinosaur collection. The space to show it is small so it doesn't look expansive but if you look at each one individually, you'll be surprised how many ther are and the variety that is shown there.",
          "I have come here multiple times and I always find something I have missed from previous visits. My family and I always enjoy seeing the exhibits and you could literally spend your time in just one section of the museum and never truly see everything. Smithsonian has its free",
          "Visited while we were in Old Town. Great place to spend a few hours browsing the various displays. Some fascinating articles of military history. Certainly worth the price of admission! Only criticism is the third floor seemed unfinished or between exhibits. This should",
          "Dr. Kardatzke is such an interesting man and knowledge about history. If you have the pleasure of running into him in his museum, you'll not regret it.",
          "We had planned to visit the Old Town area and this was a nice surprise to find there as well. Lots of different artifacts, collectibles, and history here. The layout of the museum is a little different due to the building design but not a show stopper.",
          "Our children, 7 and 9, were very interested in the exhibits. The museum is well laid out. The staff has age-based sheets the children can choose to fill out or mark-off as they tour the museum and locate specific exhibits. The area is nice and has nearby restaurants.",
          "This is the most unusual museum I've ever been to. It's full of disconnected exhibits that don't really have a common theme - for example, when you finish exploring the four or five dinosaur skeletons, you turn around and bump into a piece of the Berlin Wall! Though there wasn't",
          "This is one of those local museums in the heart of downtown you always drive by and say to yourself, hey I should go there. One day my mom and I finally did and it was not a disappointment. They have a piece of the Berlin Wall graffiti, rebar, and all. Excellent section on",
          "I had never been to this museum and coming from NY I expected it to be a little \"small town.\" What a surprise! The exhibits go from Egyptian, through ancient Arab, through the wars and much more. The way that they have the displays organized is so helpful and instructive that",
          "I've seen this place from the outside many times and went on by. I was invited to a fund raising event and decided to go. What a gem! It's deceptively big. I will go back and spend more time! Something for everybody/",
          "A diversity of exhibits of historical significance. it is a good place to help children understand the importance of the past and how impacts the present and the future.",
          "We only had a day to visit Wichita and I'm glad we made a stop here. My 10 year old son really enjoyed this place. Lots to see. There are 3 floors and each floor is filled with history. Stop by here even if you only have an hour. It's worth it.",

          "I am a native of Wichita and I have seen this place, but I have never went. I will have to say I was pleasantly surprised of all the exhibits in such small area. After you enter the building you will pass threw many artifacts from the civil war to WWII. On the upper level you",
          "Many impressive displays but the wide variety of topics made it hard to stay focussed. I should have limited myself to one area and taken the time to take it all in, instead of completing the whole tour within a couple hours. Kids will definitely enjoy the dinosaurs but",

          "We were impressed to see as much stuff from all over the world in Wichita. We learned many new things as it was very educational. We were even surprised by some of the things we saw and learned. It was heartbreaking to read about some things, but that goes to show that the",

          "The displays are not world class... but VAST in scope! It was all very interesting and took all day to meander through the museum, copious amounts of information. The displays were showing their age but it didn't detract from the entertainment we had while we were there.",
          "A T-Rex at the front door is just the beginning of a great time exploring this museum. Our 8 year old grandson was fascinated by the models of the Battleship Arizona and other Pearl Harbor exhibits. My husband spent his time nosing around the gun exhibit. They both agreed I",

          "Excellent location in old town plaza. I enjoyed this visit more than I had expected. The museum covers art, science, paleontology, world wars, roman history, egiptian history and many other disciplines. It is a broad spectrum collection of items of general history. Recomended",
          "The museum has an extensive collection from ancient Egypt, including a mummy. Its has replicas of dinosaurs. It also has an extensive Civil War collection. We went there when my son was around 5 and then I chaperoned a 3rd grade class. I think 3rd grade is probably the minimum",

          "I went in here with my father and I wasn't sure what to expect. I had read reviews elsewhere, but am often disappointed when I visit many museums these days. Key interest points: fairly decent dinosaur exhibit, including T-Rex. If memory serves, it's about 80% complete.",
          "A smorgasbord of antiquities. Quite a varied and interesting selection. Everything from Dinosaurs skeletons to War memorabilia. It is obviously someones donated private collection which explains the variety as well as the interesting layout/presentation of the items.",

          "The museum had quite a bit too see. As with most museums, there's nothing about it that would make you want to go back a second time unless you were taking someone who had never been. The admission came out to $10 for myself which was reasonable. Advertised as 3 floors, but",

        "wiki": "The Kansas Aviation Museum is a museum located in Wichita, Kansas, United States, near 31st South and George Washington Blvd.  The building was the former Wichita Municipal Airport terminal from 1935 to 1954.\nThe Museum features many display aircraft including the WB-47E Stratojet, B-52D Stratofortress, KC-135 Stratotanker, Boeing 727, Boeing 737-2H4, Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, Beech Starship, Cessna T-37, Learjet 23, Cessna 500/501 Prototype, Stearman 4D, Texico 11, Stearman Trainer, 1920 Laird Swallow, 1926 Swallow, 1930 Watkins Skylark SL, 1944 Beech Staggerwing, U-8 Seminole, and Lockheed T-33.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Administration Building in 1990. It has also been known as Building One.\n\n\n== History and Architecture ==\nSource: * Kansas Aviation MuseumThe Kansas Aviation Museum is in the Terminal and Administration building of the former Wichita Municipal Airport in Wichita. The building and landing area are constructed on ground that had never been plowed and was known as the California section. The Park Board purchased 640 acres (2.6 km2) in 1928 and, with Glen Thomas as architect, started the building on July 1, 1930, but construction soon halted due to the Great Depression and lack of funds. The building sat uncompleted until 1933 when construction resumed as a WPA project. The opening dedication ceremony took place on Sunday March 31, 1935. The runways were paved in the late 1930s as a WPA project.\nWichita was the last stop before crossing the Rocky Mountains to Denver or Los Angeles in those days. The airport was greatly needed for fuel and more importantly weather updates. As told in story after story, many people who landed, ate at the restaurant and milled about were legends of industry and film. Fred Astaire, Bob Hope, Howard Hughes and countless other famous people all walked the terrazzo floors in what is now the Kansas Aviation Museum. It was tagged the \"Country Club without dues\". During the oppressive heat of the 1930s people would come out to the airport at night, spread out a blanket, enjoy the cool breezes and watch the incoming and outgoing aircraft. The building and its grounds sit about 75 feet (23 m) higher than downtown and always has a breeze blowing.\nDuring World War II the airport became the fourth busiest in the United States being a convenient stop off in the middle of the US and with the endless flight testing of tens of thousands of aircraft being built in Wichita for the War effort. The additions on the east and west end of the building were added in 1942 and 1943. The upper part of the control tower was added in 1940. It was the first control tower to have slanted windows.\nAfter WWII and into the 1950s, the U.S. Air Force decided they needed an air base in centrally located Kansas which would later become McConnell Air Force Base, a Strategic Air Command base until mid-1992 when it became an Air Combat Command base, and December 1993 when it became an Air Mobility Command base. The Air Force didn't want to spend years designing and building a new air base; they wanted one now.\nThe Air Force and the City of Wichita came to an agreement on price and the building was sold to the Federal Government in 1951. The city bought land, designed and began construction of the new Wichita Municipal airport on the west side of Wichita. Both civil and military flights shared the airport until October 1954 when the last commercial flight took off. The Air Force continued to use the building (called Building One) until about 1984 when they shut the doors and abandoned it marking it off as surplus. It sat empty and partially gutted for at least six years until the Kansas Aviation Museum was formed in 1990 and began work. An application for the building to be placed on the Historic Register was filed on March 6, 1990 and was later approved. The outside of the building has been restored but still needs some work. The south part of the building now looks very close to how it looked in 1935.\nMuch remains to be done to the inside and millions more will have to be spent to bring it back to its 1930's heyday look. The building is without a doubt one of the most beautiful buildings in Wichita and possibly in Kansas. As of June 2012, efforts to update the museum have stagnated due to lack of funding. In 2019, improvements were made to the museum, new exterior doors were installed. The control tower glass was replaced. Both projects were done to improve the functionality of the building with  maintaining the historical standards required by the National Historical Registry.\nThe architecture of the building is art deco with its strong and obvious geometric shapes and sharp angles. At the front above the triple doors to the lobby is the famous Bas-relief of the Spirit of St.Louis crossing the Atlantic with Ireland in sight. A bas-relief sculpture is raised or sunken and not a flat piece of artwork. Carthalite was used to for the bas-relief to provide longevity and maintain the color vitality. Carthalite is  white portland cement concrete with colored glass aggregates.\nThe Kansas Aviation Museum is one of only a few museums that allow visitors to enter its exhibition aircraft. The museum operates a once yearly \"Play on a Plane Day\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCosmosphere in Hutchinson\nCombat Air Museum in Topeka\nMid-America Air Museum in Liberal\nKansas World War II army airfields\nList of aerospace museums\nList of museums in Kansas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWings Over Kansas: Aviation Hall of Fame Inductees 1986\u20131999 List\nAdministrative Building from the National Park Service site Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary\nAdministrative Building NRHP Application (12 page PDF) - National Park Service",

          "Lots of cool exhibits located in an old airport building. You not only learn a lot, but get a sense of what air travel was like back in the day.",
          "My husband is a private pilot and loves planes so a visit to this museum was a must while we were in Wichita. He really enjoyed it and I thought it was interesting too. They have many private/commercial and military planes. The history of Wichita's aviation industry was",
          "They have some pretty cool stuff if you are an aviation nerd, but I was a bit disappointed. There are better museums and attractions in Wichita in my opinion.",
          "I found the second floor and the tower to be the best. There is tons of information and there was an employee there with even more to share. The control tower was awesome with some afb aircraft flying. They have radio communications up there as well very interesting views too.",
          "Pretty neat interactive exhibits! Kid friendly spaces as well. Indoor and outdoor exhibits. It would have been really nice to have the ability to get inside the plans outside on the ramps.",
          "Excellent place to visit if your into aviation history. The building itself is a wonder to wander around...really interesting architecture. The exhibits are reflective of the Kansas aviation heritage....with examples of early aircraft, engines and artifacts. It\u2019s nice to be",
          "It was nice to get perspective on historical aircraft like the B-52 as well as the other displayed aircraft.",
          "As an airplane nut you need to visit this museum. I wish they could park their airplanes inside. The weather is doing a number on the oldies. Nice selection of airplanes including Learjet, Citation, B-52, B-47 and FedEx 727 and many more.",
          "This museum is easy to get to. It is located in the original Wichita Municipal Airport building. Inside the museum are displays that chronciles the growth and development of aviation in Kansas. On the outside is a hugh display of various aircraft.",
          "Very fitting to have an air museum here with so many airplane manufacturers starting here. This old airport has been turned into a museum and had many exhibits in and outdoors. The Art Deco building retains its original features and is an exhibit in itself.",
          "While the collection is stunning, there is a serious lack of relatability for a layman. It would be good to get someone to do the captions a little better so that people like me who know very little about airplanes but would love to, can enjoy the museum more. The control tower",
          "I took my mother there about 20 yrs ago and she told me the story of how she waited there all night for her army airforce brother to arrive during WWII.He made it. This time I went with daughter and her 2 kids 7 and 10. The old B-17 or B-29 (Doc) that they were reconstructing",
          "This spot is a really neat place to visit. Aviation museum in the air capital is a good use of your time.",
          "This museum is a local gem, offering a comprehensive look at Wichita's contributions to aviation. Home of some of the world's most famous flying names, Wichita is a hometown of general aviation. This museum does a good job of chronicling its history with a good layout, well kept",
          "my 6 year old loved their flight simulator great look back in history and up close with planes outside disappointed that observation deck area was closed as I understand you can see alot of Wichita from that view a hidden gem",
          "After reading all the negative reviews from the naysayers who were expecting the Smithsonian, I was hesitant to go, but I'm so glad I did. I had no idea that Wichita used to be the airplane capital of the US until Boeing, Beech, Cesna, etc. pulled out and left it a ghost town.",
          "This might be an okay, partial day trip, if you lived within 15 minutes. We drove an hour and a half to get there and we're very disappointed. If you like model airplanes and write-ups about them it would be a great place to spend a little time. There are a few cool older planes",
          "Best kept secret out of the way place in Wichita. A great place to visit and learn about Wichita aviation and aviation in general for adults and young people",
          "You probably need to be an aviation buff to enjoy this museum, BUT there are some nice kids areas as well. Good displays inside including the history of aviation in Kansas. Some nice aircraft outside as well. The tower (which was closed during my visit) looks to provide some",
          "Really great museum - friendly staff - interesting & amazing exhibits! And a cool old building on top of it all! Really enjoyed coming here",
          "We took our son here because he is interested in aviation. He had a wonderful time looking around at everything. He had a lot of good pictures and a few stories to tell everyone when he got back home. This is definitely a good place to check out.",
          "We had the annual 931st AMXS Christmas party at the Museum and it was such an amazing place! The exhibits are awesome. So well put together. The rooms they have set up for kids are so cool. The Museum has something for everyone. A great place to take the family and see some rich",
          "We had a great time wondering around looking at the exhibits. The building itself is worth it, the front relief is great, I do love old buildings especially built by the WPA or ccc . You can go into the tower it has a great view. The airplanes, what can I say just beautiful.",
          "My son and I checked this place out and found it to be very interesting. There was a large variety of display of aviation history as well as several old planes inside the museum. In addition the to indoor setting, there are numerous airplanes outside on the tarmac that you can",
          "This is aviation history and specifically Wichita aviation history with static displays of historic aircraft. Do not miss this on a visit to Wichita.",
          "I've been to Wichita on mnay occasions for business and always make time to visit this sight. I have been watch the progression on a restoration of a bi-plane. It's amazing the work it takes and ingenuity required to fabricate parts that no longer are available.",
          "I spent over three hours and didn't get to see all of the exhibits. The aviation history of Wichita is extensive. I'm so glad that I went, it really causes me to want to see the few other museums of aviation that I haven't been to. The details presented represent an extensive",
          "I really enjoyed this place, and found it very educational. The displays are good, both inside and out. The outside planes were showing some signs of weathering, but it did not detract from the experience. This is good for aviation buffs and others alike.",
          "Fun to walk through this period airport terminal and imagine the way it must have been in its day. Large static aircraft display is a bit of a graveyard as none are being restored, but aircraft indoors are beautiful. Lots of information about this airports history and Kansas",
          "Lots of history in this place. However for the admission price, they need a facelift and some new planes outside. I enjoyed learning more about Wichita Aviation. Clean bathrooms.",
          "This was definitely a surprise type of experience. Upon arriving, the children were able to play in a hot air balloon basket while we checked-in. The building had plenty of hands on activities and features for the children to enjoy. They could climb and run and ride on",
          "An alright museum that could use some TLC. When you walk in, you wonder if anyone is actually here, as no one was at the front desk and the museum was empty. After waiting around at the front desk looking at stuff in their gift shop, a lady hurried out of an office across the",
          "My husband and I took our 9-year-old nephew here to see the planes. Yes, the planes outside are old and not restored but still very interesting to look at. Inside are restored planes and a lot of plane models. All of the planes in the cases on the second floor were of planes",
          "I never expected to be attending a wedding at a venue like this! In all honesty, it was beautiful. There was something for everyone to do before the wedding kicked off - especially the interactive simulation room for the younger guests to entertain themselves with. It didn't",
          "This is a large facility, lots of older planes. Control Tower was fun to visit. Several of the interactive displays were not functioning. A lot of interactive displays were very old and falling apart. There were several beautiful planes that had been refurbished indoor.",

          "This is the best kept secret in Wichita for kids and aviation oriented adults. Weather you are a aviation professional or a weekend flyer, there is many items of interest. i.e. The original ICT control tower",
          "This '20s Era Aviation Terminal, long abandoned, now refurbished, holds much of the history of aviation. Located in the Air Capital of the World, it is not the easiest place to find, but well worth finding.",
          "Great collection of planes and artifacts - great look at Wichita Aviation history!!! The check in lady was extremely helpful!",
          "It might appear that this place is \"worn\" or not maintained. Actually, it's a new site in process. The terminal building was abandoned, but then reclaimed by the Kansas aviation group. They're just getting started and the future looks bright. Exhibits for major aircraft",
          "Once I ran a 5K race around this location. I had always wanted to see the inside of it. My museum loving brother was up for a visit so we decided to go. It was interesting to see all the planes and I loved the Art Deco Architecture. It was also interesting to go up into the",
          "I visited the Kansas Aviation Museum to see if it would work for a reception that we were having later in the year. The building is a little worn but the exhibits are interesting. Lots of planes from different years. I liked the TWA exhibit and the Control Tower the best.",
          "It is interesting. Wish there was even a portion of a plane to explore on the inside. Was hoping to show family that has never flown. Make sure you remember which door you go out of when venturing on outside. Has room for more. The control tower was great.",
          "Having spent many years working in museums, this one is fun for the visitor. Took a nephew and loved seeing the world through his eyes.",
          "Came for my husband who loves planes, trains and automobiles. We both expected it to be underwhelming with little info or exhibits, but we were wrong. Tons of exhibits and historical information that was interesting for my hubby. I loved going on the field and seeing the old",
          "You are experiencing aviation history at the birthplace of of aircraft manufacturing in beech, Cessna, steersman and Boeing all began in Wichita",
          "I have no clue why this place gets good reviews. It is GAWD-AWFUL! The displays inside are unorganized, and not particularly informative. Since I grew up in Wichita, I was able to explain to my wife, who didn't, what they were talking about. The facility does not take any sort",
          "This was a great place to gain insight into the aviation history of Witcha. We learned a lot and was surprised by some of the history. There were a few places with no displays, slightly run down, and dark, but overall still a sight to visit.",
          "we took our 5 year old and 2 1/2 year old grandkids there and they loved it! Great find in Wichita. So much to do, both inside and out.",
          "Went to this museum with 2 friends from out of town and was pleasantly surprised at the number of outdoor exhibits and the interesting look back on Wichita's aviation history.",
          "This used to be the \"Main Airport\" in Wichita. Many changes have taken place over the years. However, you just can't explain what it feels like to walk up to the \"Tower\" and see so much of Wichita, and they play the current Airport, (Eisenhower) in Wichita, the air traffic.",
          "It had some old airplanes and artifacts. There was a wall of avaiation hall of farmers that was interesting.",
          "Took our out of town guest to let them see and experience the aviation history of Wichita. Let them see some of the air craft built in Wichita over the years. Show them the old Boeing plant and a peek at McConnell AFB",
          "I really want to love this place, Wichita prides itself on being the Air Capital, and this museum could be absolutely AWESOME, given half a chance. I took my elderly wheelchair-bound father there before he passed away, and sadly all he could do was sit in the lobby because the",
          "This is a great museum to visit if you love anything aviation! Recommend allowing for at least 2-3 hours and going on a nice day so you can enjoy the static displays outside.",
          "Located in an old airport terminal. Stopped here as the daughter is very interested in aviation. It was okay, not my cup of tea. The exhibits are housed over three floors and outside. Interesting to walk through and some of the items I found interesting as it relates to flying",
          "From the original art deco ICT air terminal, to the outside exhibits, this is a hidden jewel. You can just feel the aviation history!",
          "There are only six or so aircraft in lousy state. Looks like it needs a bigger flow of tourists to support itself, but I can\u00b4t seem to realize how they are going to attracts more people with such a small collection",
          "Very excited to go with the rich aviation history of Wichita. Great collection of planes inside but so much more of a story to tell. Displays outside were in varying states of decay. Planes clearly needed work outside. Would love to see a great exhibit on Amelia Earhart - not",
          "My daughter and her new husband chose The Kansas Aviation Museum as their wedding venue. It could not have been more perfect. Since the wedding and dinner, reception, dance were all going to be in the same location it ws logistically great. The room for the bridal party was",
          "Good selection of aircraft & airplane parts and their history. If McConnel AFB is flying planes when you are there, the air traffic control tower is the place to be. We even saw \"Doc\" the recently restored B29 parked over by the Spirit plant. Great way to spend a couple hours.",
          "This is a terrific collection of planes and aviation parts. If you don't see what you like inside, just go out on the tarmack and look at the Full birds out there. Including a FedEx Jet, a Learjet, Citation and plenty of others. Super fun look at aviation",
          "Great day out, enough to look at and so well done, I was a bit dubious at first as when we arrived we went straight outside to look at the planes in the courtyard and the I thought it was a bit run down. After we had a look around we went inside and wow it was fantastic. The",
          "We live in the Wichita-area, but had never visited the Kansas Aviation Museum. I didn't have high expectations, but I was blown away when we got there. The museum is located in the old Wichita Municipal Airport building, just outside of McConnell Air Force Base. There are quite",
          "Many exhibts for kids to engage in and plenty of avation history regarding Kansas and the Wichita area. The out door exhibits are in need of maintenance. If you find yourself in Wichita Kansas and are interested in avaition, the Kansas Avaition Museum is worth the small",
          "If your an aviation buff, it's a nice place to spend and hour. The admission was $9 and worth it just to go up and sit in the old control tower, listen to the chatter at the she met airbase and watch the planes come and go. There are a few planes on display but unless your a",
          "A must for aviation enthusiasts and also those who aren't. Heaps to see and play with. Climb up to the old control tower and see the stunning views. Climb aboard the FedEx plane and wander through the airfield to view old Air Force planes. The simulators are pretty cool to play",
          "They have worked very hard to create this museum of local aviation history and it shows. Although it is small, the exhibits are high quality and the architecture of the building is fascinating. The local people need to support this effort to keep the history of what helped",
          "The Museum is very well designed with lots of exhibits both models and actual parts/pieces. The control tower was a neat view. We visited over the weekend while there was a car show with classic cars being displayed near the aircraft displayed outside.",
          "My grandkids and I had a blast at the museum. Although only 4 and 6 years old, they had a wonderful time on the simulators and flying paper airplanes. It was not at all crowded so they were able to explore it to their hearts content. Definitely a must and very affordable.",
          "It is not a big museum and there aren't many planes, but it is very important historically, and many of the planes on exhibit were made in Boeing/Wichita. The building itself is an important example of art-deco architecture and is worth the trip itself. You can also go up into",
          "Nice place to visit. No big crowds and you can go out on the ramp and walk around the aircraft. They have a B-52 and a B-47 on display - both types having been built in Wichita (can say for sure the ones on display were built there but they did build B-52s & B-47s in Wichita)",
          "This museum is focused on the Beech and Cessna civil aviation history. It is at an old terminal and is well kept and clean. It has a few military planes. I was disappointed that I was a week too early to watch the 2nd flying B29 in the world, \"DOC\" fly its maiden flight from",
          "Have toured the museum that is continuing to grow and add exhibits. The site of the first tower in the Wichita area and one you are able to tour first hand and read the history of. The many airplanes, parts and historical data provided makes it a great place to visit. We also",
          "This museum is nirvana for any aviation buff. Interesting, unrestored airplanes on display adjacent to the museum and wonderful exhibits inside.",
          "This aviation museum could be world class, but it obviously needs more funding. It's housed in a former rundown airport which still needs to be refurbished. It's a good start just needs a lot of work.",
          "Good Wichita aviation history museum in an historic location. Has s nice collection of historic planes on the tarmac. Unfortunately the outside temperature was over 100, so we had to move back inside rather quickly. The inside of the museum contains a lot of information of the",
          "The Kansas Aviation Museum is housed in the former Municipal Airport Terminal in Wichita. It has actual aircraft from different eras on display along with other artifacts of flying. There is a hall display dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen and other prominent Black airmen",
          "Any aircraft Enthusiast would love this place. Lots of great history here. I try to stop in every time I through Wichita.",
          "We planned our route through Kansas to visit this museum. We were more than disappointed when we walked up to the door and saw it was closed early for a special event. We had checked their FB page and website and it said they were open that day 10-6. The attendant advised us to",
          "If you are into airplanes, this place is worth the visit. They have several outside on the ramp. I liked the control tower . You can see in every direction. Also they have lots of other stuff worth seeing.",
          "Truth be told, Wichita is pretty thin on the ground for entertainment and sightseeing so this is about as good as it gets. Very quiet, no crowds, lots and lots to see and you can take your time to take excellent photos. Worth a visit if you have time to kill, i mean, what",
          "Wichita is called \"Air Capital\" so it is must to see Aviation Museum. It very well organized and very educational. It is great place to take your kids.",
          "The exhibits and static airplanes were worth a visit and the admission if you have the time, but not very exciting for young grandchildren unless they are heavy into aviation.",
          "The museum is constantly improving. Has added handicapped access, an elevator and air conditioning within the last year. Nice area for the kids to learn and visit.",
          "VERY AWESOME place to see old airplanes and learn history of airplanes and their use. Go up in the control tower and look out. Buy souvenirs.",
          "This place offers not only the aviation history but also actual aircraft. The building itself appears to be work in progress (some crews were working on the display cases, etc), but all in all it's worth taking a look at.",
          "My relatives and I were in the area for a wedding. Having a day to tour around, this was the only thing that I thought would interest my 1 year old son. We were a group of 14 including my boy, a bunch of relatives in the military, two college students, 1 high schooler and my",
          "I was passing through wichita, saw the sign and thought why not and spent a couple of hours looking around the museum, also going up into the control tower with views over the airbase. The staff are really friendly.",
          "Not a bad place to go at all. Had a lot of aviation history stuff. Had a lot of simulators both mechanical and computers. Very kid friendly and a lot of computer stuff for them to do. You can even go up into the control tower. They also had a display of airplanes outside.",
          "My 11 year old wants to go here every time we visit KS. This time though we had three kids under four with us so I was dreading it. I was super surprised when we got to the second floor that was pretty much a designated play space for kids under 5. I hung out with the little",
          "First rate museum for the person interested in aviation. Many examples of aircraft and the history behind each of them. Some were actually built in Wichita and have a special history of their own.",

          "Three floors of Wichita-specific aviation history, airplane engines, and some restored older aircraft are housed in the old Wichita Municipal Airport building. In addition there are a dozen more modern aircraft on the ramp just outside and you can ascend into the restored",

          "I had three grandsons with me and we decided to give this a try , they are still talking about all the neat stuff they got to see and experience here. A must see place to visit in Wichita",
          "A trip to the Kansas Aviation Museum is a must for aviation buffs. The building is spectacular and is on its way to being restored to its old glory. I had the great opportunity to have a semi-guided tour by one of the volunteers. Without his knowledge the experience would not",

          "This place is fantastic well worth the visit. It took a while to see the whole place and the restrictions of photos you have to be aware of, but the planes are amazing the cockpits inside the place are a great place for the kids to play. The building itself it great it really",
          "Took my 15 year old grandson. He is a history buff. He liked the hands on exhibits, seeing how different airline travel was compared to today, the control tower, and the Mercedes. The Fed Ex plane was available for entering. Hopefully the other planes will be available for",
          "For being the capital of aviation it wasnt worth it We went thinking that we might be able to see lots and lots of planes and what a surprise we got! Everything was so dirty, no variety and no clear instructions to tell you where to go, sadly a complete waste of time, won't go",
          "This is a medium size museum, and for those who love aviation you will find in the tarmac some great aircrafts as the A37, the B 52, B727, among others, inside of the museum you will find amazing part of the American aviation history, as a retired air traffic controller I found",
          "I have to say this was much better than I anticipated! I loved all the airplanes and hands on items that they had. The kids LOVED pressing all the various buttons. I loved all the reading materials and probably my favorite was the air traffic control tower. I loved reading",
          "It is worth a visit, the museum is in the original building and it is in very good condition, outside they have different planes and you can take pictures of it. They did a good job inside you can read about Wichita aviation, this is a good place to take your kids, they will",
          "The family visited here out of curiosity. It was great to learn about the aviation history in the city. I have lived in Wichita most of my life and until this visit I had no idea about the history of the airport and how vital it was to cross country travel. The exhibits were",
          "Very interesting. it was fun going up into the air traffic control tower. It was really hot, there was only one plane you could tour inside, but this was a minor issue as the rest of the museum is well worth visiting",
          "I might give this three stars for the actual condition of the museum but four stars for all the updates that are underway. The museum is in the old Wichita airport terminal between McConnell Air Force Base and former Boeing now Spirit. It needs LOTS of work. At present, they",
          "Two floors of information and also the old planes outdoors. An elevator will be installed by Fall of 2015 for people with disabilities. You can also climb up to the skydeck or place where they used to direct planes when it was an airport and an airfield.",
          "This is in the old Wichita Airport Terminal building. The exhibits inside are ok, but not real exciting. The big attraction is the planes on the flight line, some of which you can go into. Also, it was nice to be able to go up into the control tower and see all over. I",
          "The museum looks like a work in progress but there are three floors of aviation history that you can view at your own pace. You can view airplanes up close outside the building. A real gem!",
          "The museum keeps improving, and is getting better and better at serving school-agers to introduce and invigorate an enthusiasm for aerospace and aviation. Wichita's important contributions to the history of American aviation are well preserved and documented in this facility.",
          "There is quite a bit of aviation history made in Kansas with Beech, Boeing, and Cessna located nearby. This museum has good explanations and exhibits, a variety of aircraft on display on the grounds, and is housed in a previous airport complete with air traffic control",
          "I'm not really into planes, so really wasn't terribly excited about heading to this musuem with my hubby, but I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The art deco decor on the building alone was worth the trip. There are several very good exhibits. I learned a lot, and had a nice time -",

          "Even though the museum is under construction for renovations, it doesn't deter from the historical importance that the original airport played in Wichita's airline-accented past. The fact that you can see the planes up close (right next to McConnell AFB) and ascend into the",

          "If you are lucky you will be able to see a plane being restored. This is a great place to view Wichita's rich aircraft history. They have several planes from the past and it is all located in and around Wichita's very first airport. The mural on the outside is a must see.",

          "Museum covers the history of aviation in Kansas. Great room with alot of the early aircraft engines. They built a Stearman in the building! Would love to see how they plan on moving it! The view from the control tower is great, tallest point in Wichita. Have live ATC radio for",
          "There are some nice exhibits inside but it's a small museum and overpriced. The photography rule makes sense, why do you need a long distance lens when you can walk up to the exhibits?",
          "The museum is actually the old Wichita airport and is interesting alone for its architecture. While much of what's inside may only be found truly enthralling by air enthusiasts, the planes outside and the sense of history are worth a visit.",
          "We really enjoyed all the exhibs including old flight attendants' uniforms & items from years past. Enjoyed the old control tower too.",
          "I showed up at the admission desk with two SLR cameras (one film and one digital). The polite lady apologized and said that because the museum was on the grouonds of McChord AFB, I would only be allowed to bring one camera. Furthermore, the military would not allow lenses",
          "Planes are decaying on the runway and most of the exhibits inside are static. Look at stuff and read lots of signs. I was expecting good representation from Boeing, Beechcraft, Cessna and LearJet there. A few planes but that is all. Someone needs to be an advocate for them and",
          "I'd been meaning to go since we'd never been before. It was great and really exceeded my expectations. Loved the old airplanes and the highlight was getting up to the tower to watch the tankers take off from McConnell.",
          "Next to McConnell AFB. This museum is in an old building with some donated planes outside. Admission is expensive for what it is, but there are costs to be covered. Wichita produces 1/3 of the planes in the US and almost all the private jets. One would think that these",
          "It took us about two hours to go through this museum. We went outside and read about each of the planes outside. They had a bomber that was inactive and no longer in service. I thought it was interesting that the information on the plane said that the Russians sent a satellite",
          "Well worth a visit. Not piles of aircraft but those they have are very interesting, historic and not just run of the mill. Tons and tons and tons of very interesting local aviation history to view in the beautiful old terminal building. Right next to Mc Connell AFB. A must",
          "Several great little displays, but very poorly staffed and run. Two people working when we arrived. Not even a place to hang your coats. This little gem has a great deal of potential but as it is now, its an old airport, with a bunch of old plane parts. Shame. The kids area",
          "Avarything is a little old and outdated, but I could not blame the staff. There were not too many volunteers and I bet the funding is not great either. I cannot personally understand how the big aviation companies like Beech and Cessna are letting the museum disintegrate like",

        "wiki": "The Wichita people or Kitikiti'sh are a confederation of Southern Plains Native American tribes. Historically they spoke the Wichita language and Kichai language, both Caddoan languages. They are indigenous to Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas.\nToday, Wichita tribes, which include the Kichai people, Yscani, Waco, Taovaya, Tawakoni, and the Wichita proper (or Guichita or Kanoatino), are federally recognized as the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco and Tawakoni).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe Wichita and Affiliated Tribes are headquartered in Anadarko, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Caddo County, Oklahoma. The Wichitas are a self-governance tribe, who operate their own housing authority and issue tribal vehicle tags.The current tribal administration is as follows.\n\nPresident: Terri Parton\nVice-President: Jesse E. Jones\nSecretary: Myles Stephenson Jr.\nTreasurer: Vanessa Vance\n\n\n== Economic development ==\nThe tribe owns the Sugar Creek Casino, several restaurants, the Sugar Creek Event Center, and Hinton Travel Inn in Hinton. It owns a smoke shop, travel plaza, and historical center in Anadarko. Their annual economic impact in 2010 was $4.5 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Wichita language is one of the Caddoan languages. They are related by language and culture to the Pawnee, with whom they enjoy close relations.\nThe Wichita lived in fixed villages notable for their large, domed-shaped, grass-covered dwellings, sometimes up to 30 feet in diameter. The Wichita were successful hunters and farmers and skilled traders and negotiators. Their historical homelands stretched from San Antonio, Texas in the south to as far north as Great Bend, Kansas. A semi-sedentary people, they occupied northern Texas in the early 18th century. They traded with other Southern Plains Indians on both sides of the Red River and as far south as Waco.\nThe Wichita made much of their own art, notably making their own ceramic pottery that greatly fascinated French and Spanish traders. Wichita pottery is \"virtually indistinguishable from the Osage and Pawnee\", two other closely related Indigenous groups.Historically, for much of the year, the Wichita lived in huts made of forked cedar poles covered by dry grasses. In the winter, they followed American bison (buffalo) in a seasonal hunt and lived in hunting camps. Wichita people relied heavily on bison, using all parts\u2014for clothing, food and cooking fat, winter shelter, leather supplies, sinew, medicine, and even armor. Each spring, Wichita families to their villages for another season of cultivating crops. Eventually, horses played a large role in the Wichita people's lifestyle. Increased access to horses in the mid 17th century caused Wichita hunting styles and seasons to become longer and more community-oriented. The Wichita economy also focused on horticulture, root-gathering, and fruits and nuts.\nWichita people wore clothing from tanned hides, which the women prepared and sewed. They often decorated their dresses with elk canine teeth. Both men and women tattooed their faces and bodies with solid and dotted lines and circles.\nWichita people had a history of intermarriage and alliance with other groups. Notably, the women of the Wichita worked with the Pueblo to harvest crops and engage in trade. Pueblo women were recorded to have intermarried with Wichita people and lived together in Wichita villages.\nIn terms of social structure, the Wichita were organized by ranking of each tribe. Tribes were also led by two chiefs.\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThe Wichita tribes call themselves Kitikiti'sh / Kirikirish (\"raccoon-eyed people\"), because of the historical practice of tattooing marks around their eyes. The kindred Pawnee called them K\u00edrikuuruks / K\u00edrikuruks (\"bear-eyed people\") and the Arikara referred to them as \u010ciriku\u00fanux (a reference to the Wichita practice of tattoos). The Kiowa knew them as Thoe-Khoot (\"tattoo faces\").\n\n\n=== Bands ===\nWichita people have been a loose confederation of related peoples on the Southern Plains, including such bands or sub-tribes as Taovayas (Tawehash), Tawakonis, Wacos (who appear to have been the Yscani/Iscanis of earlier times), and Guichitas or Wichita Proper; smaller bands are listed as well: Akwits (also Akwesh, Asidahetsh, or Asidahesh, a former northern Pawnee splinter group, which joined the Wichita), Itaz, Kishkat, and Korishkitsu (the two latter names may be a Wichita name for the Kichai). The Taovaya were the most important in the 18th century. The French called the Wichita peoples Panis Piqu\u00e9s (i.e. Pawnee Picts) or Panis Noirs (i.e. Black Pawnees), because they practiced tattooing; sometimes the Panis Piqu\u00e9s or Panis Noirs are included into the listing of Wichita sub-tribes, but it seems that there were no known separate sub-tribe which can be identified by this name. One Pawnee splinter grouping known as Panismahas moved from what is now Nebraska to the Texas-Arkansas border regions where they lived with the Taovayas.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Wichita people had a unified language system with minor dialectical differences based on the geography of unique tribes. Derived from the Caddoan language, much of the Wichita language was indistinguishable between tribes they shared close alliances with.\n\n\n=== Cultural institutions ===\nIn 2018, the Wichita Tribes opened the Wichita Tribal History Center in Anadarko, which shares Wichita history, archaeology, visual arts, and culture with the public.The Wichita Annual Dance, a powwow, is held at the Wichita Tribal Park on US-281, north of Anadarko, every August.\n\n\n=== Historical Sites ===\nSeveral sites spanning across different time periods are spread around the United States. These sites exist in terraces around the Red River in Oklahoma and Texas, and they contain artifacts such as pottery, arrows, knives, clay figurines, and European trade goods. Large-scale excavations of these sites also reveal large burial and ritualistic structures that the Wichita people used throughout history.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precontact history ===\nAfter the man and woman were made they dreamed that things were made for them, and when they woke they had the things of which they had dreamed... The woman was given an ear of corn... It was to be the food of the people that should exist in the future, to be used generation after generation. \u2014Tawakoni Jim in The Mythology of the Wichita, 1904\nThe Ancestral Wichita people lived in the eastern Great Plains from the Red River in Arkansas north to Nebraska for at least 2,000 years. Early Wichita people were hunters and gatherers who gradually adopted agriculture. Farming villages were developed about 900 CE on terraces above the Washita and South Canadian Rivers in present-day Oklahoma. The women of these 10th-century communities cultivated varieties of maize, beans, and squash (known as the Three Sisters), marsh elder (Iva annua), and tobacco, which was important for religious purposes. The men hunted deer, rabbits, turkey, and, primarily, bison, and caught fish and harvested mussels from the rivers. These villagers lived in rectangular, thatched-roof houses.Archaeologists describe the Washita River Phase from 1250 to 1450, when local populations grew and villages of up to 20 houses were spaced every two or so miles along the rivers. These farmers may have had contact with the Panhandle culture villages in the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles, farming villages along the Canadian River. The Panhandle villagers showed signs of adopting cultural characteristics of the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande Valley, with whom they interacted.\nIn the late 15th century, most of these Washita River villages were abandoned for reasons that are not known today.\n\n\n==== Great Bend settlements and council circles ====\n\nNumerous archaeological sites in central Kansas near the Great Bend of the Arkansas River share common traits and are collectively known as the \"Great Bend aspect.\" Radiocarbon dates from these sites range from AD 1450 to 1700. Great Bend aspect sites are generally accepted as ancestral to the Wichita peoples described by Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado and other early European explorers. The discovery of limited quantities of European artifacts, such as chain mail and iron axe heads at several Great Bend sites, suggests contact of these people with early Spanish explorers.Great Bend aspect peoples' subsistence economy included agriculture, hunting, gathering, and fishing. Villages were located on the upper terraces of rivers, and crops appear to have been grown on the fertile floodplains below. Primary crops were maize, beans, squash, and sunflowers, cultivated for their seeds. Gathered foods included walnut and hickory nuts, and the fruits of plum, hackberry, and grape. Remains of animal bones in Great Aspect sites include bison, elk, deer, pronghorn, and dog, one of the few domesticated animals in the pre-Contact Plains.\nSeveral village sites contain the remains of unusual structures called \"council circles,\" located at the center of settlements. Archaeological excavations suggest they consist of a central patio surrounded by four semi-subterranean structures. The function of the council circles is unclear. Archaeologist Waldo Wedel suggested in 1967 that they may be ceremonial structures, possibly associated with solstice observations. Recent analysis suggests that many non-local artifacts occur exclusively or primarily within council circles, implying the structures were occupied by political and/or ritual leaders of the Great Bend aspect peoples. Other archaeologists leave open the possibility that the council circle earthworks served a defensive role.One of these sites was the city Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kansas, near the Arkansas River, that flourished between 1450 and 1700.\n\n\n=== Post-contact history ===\n\nIn 1541 Spanish explorer Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado journeyed east from the Rio Grande Valley in search of a rich land called Quivira. In Texas, probably in the Blanco River Canyon near Lubbock, Coronado met people he called Teyas who might have been related to the Wichita and the earlier Plains villagers. The Teyas, if in fact they were Wichita, were probably the ancestors of the Iscani and Waco, although they might also have been the Kichai, who spoke a different language but later joined the Wichita tribe. Turning north, he found Quivira and the people later known as the Wichita near the town of Lyons, Kansas. He was disappointed in his search for gold as the Quivirans appear to have been prosperous farmers and good hunters but had no gold or silver. There were about 25 villages of up to 200 houses each in Quivira. Coronado said: \"They were large people of very good build\", and he was impressed with the land, which was \"fat and black.\" Though Coronado was impressed with Wichita society, he often treated the Wichita poorly in his expedition. Even after Wichita migration, some settlements were thought to have remained in northern Quivira in 1680.It was also noted: \"They eat meat raw/jerky like the Querechos [the Apache] and Teyas. They are enemies of one another...These people of Quivira have the advantage over the others in their houses and in growing of maize\".\n\nThe Quivirans apparently called their land Tancoa (which bears a resemblance to the later sub-tribe called Tawakoni) and a neighboring province on the Smoky Hill River was called Tabas (which bears a resemblance to the sub-tribe of Taovayas). Settlements existed here until the Wichita were driven away in the 18th century.\nSixty years after Coronado's expedition the founder of New Mexico Juan de O\u00f1ate visited Etzanoa, the Wichita city. O\u00f1ate journeyed east from New Mexico, crossing the Great Plains and encountering two large settlements of people he called Escanjaques (possibly Yscani) and Rayados, most certainly Wichita. The Rayado city was probably on the Walnut River near Arkansas City, Kansas. O\u00f1ate described the city as containing \"more than twelve hundred houses\" which would indicate a population of about 12,000. His description of the Etzanoa was similar to that of Coronado's description of Quivira. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash they grew in their fields. O\u00f1ate's Rayados were certainly Wichita, probably the sub-tribe later known as the Guichitas.What the Coronado and O\u00f1ate expeditions showed was that the Wichita people of the 16th century were numerous and widespread. They were not, however, a single tribe at this time but rather a group of several related tribes speaking a common language. The dispersed nature of their villages probably indicated that they were not seriously threatened by attack by enemies, although that would change as they would soon be squeezed between the Apache on the West and the powerful Osage on the East. European diseases would also probably be responsible for a large decline in the Wichita population in the 17th century.\nIn 1719, French explorers visited two groups of Wichita. Bernard de la Harpe found a large village near present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma and Claude Charles Du Tisne found two villages near Neodesha, Kansas. Regarding religion, La Harpe noticed that the Wichita people \"had little of it\". He did, however, gain knowledge on the presence of a Great Spirit that the Wichita worshipped. Coronado's Quivira was abandoned early in the 18th century, probably due to Apache attacks. The Rayados of O\u00f1ate were probably still living in about the same Walnut River location. Archaeologists have located a Wichita village at the Deer Creek Site dating from the 1750s on the Arkansas River east of Newkirk, Oklahoma. By 1757, however, it appears that all the Wichita had migrated south to the Red River.The most prominent of the Wichita sub-tribes were the Taovayas. In the 1720s they had moved south from Kansas to the Red River establishing a large village on the north side of the River at Petersburg, Oklahoma and on the south side at Spanish Fort, Texas. They adopted many traits of the nomadic Plains Indians and were noted for raiding, trading. They had a close alliance with the French, and in 1746 a French brokered alliance with the Comanche revived the fortunes of the Wichita. The village at Petersburg was \"a lively emporium where Comanches brought Apache slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovaya-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.\"The Wichita and their Comanche allies were known to the Spanish as the Norte\u00f1os (Northerners). The Wichita people and the Comanche attacked a Spanish military expedition in 1759. Afterwards, in response to the destruction by the Norte\u00f1os of the San Saba Mission the Spanish undertook an expedition to punish the Indians. Their 500-man army attacked the twin villages on Red River, but was defeated by the Wichita and Comanche in the Battle of the Twin Villages. The Spanish suffered 19 dead and 14 wounded, leaving two cannons on the battlefield, although they claimed to have killed more than 100 Indians.The alliance between the Wichita, especially the Taovayas, and the Comanche began to break up in the 1770s as the Wichita sought a better relationship with the Spanish. Taovaya power in Texas declined sharply after an epidemic, probably smallpox, in 1777 and 1778 killed about one-third of the tribe. After the Americans took over their territory as a result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the independence of Texas in 1836, all the related tribes were increasingly lumped together and dubbed \"Wichita.\" That designation also included the Kichai of northern Texas, who spoke a different although a related language.\nThe principal village of the Wichita in the 1830s was near the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma although the Tawakoni and Wacos still lived in Texas and were moved onto a reservation on the upper Brazos River. They were forced out of Texas to a reservation in Oklahoma in 1859. During the Civil War, the Wichita allied with the Union side. They moved to Kansas, where they established a village at the site of present-day Wichita, Kansas. In 1867 they were relocated to a reservation in southwest Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in the area where most of them continue to reside today. On June 4, 1891, the affiliated tribes signed an agreement with the Cherokee Commission for individual allotments.Clashes with Texans and Americans throughout the early to mid 19th century led to the signing of a reservation treaty with America in 1846, resulting in their eventual displacement to an Oklahoman reservation in 1872.\n\n\n=== Relationships with Other Indigenous Tribes ===\nFor the most part, Wichita relationships were harmonious and cooperative. Notably, the Wichita were allies with the Comanche and traded with them. However, they were enemies with groups such as the Pawnee, the Missouri, and the Apache. The Apache were the Wichita's worst enemies, having driven them out of their homes before contact with Europeans.\nThe Wichita people's relationship with the Osage is ambiguous - it is said to have been \"cautiously hostile\", but many Osage groups attacked them in the 18th century, eventually driving them out of the Arkansas River Basin.\n\n\n=== Trade ===\nDue to geographical isolation, it was difficult for the French and Spanish to trade with the Wichita. The French traded with the Wichita primarily for their horses during the 16th century. The Wichita sensed that trading with the French would be ideal. Their migration in 1714 was partly motivated by their desire to move closer to European traders.\nThe Wichita first gained their European commodities in the mid 18th century, inspiring them to maintain close ties with the French in the 19th century. French traders were eager to exchange their goods with Wichita settlements as they traveled from Louisiana to Santa Fe.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe Wichita had a large population in the time of Coronado and O\u00f1ate. One scholar estimates their numbers at 200,000. Villages often contained around 1,000 to 1,250 people per village. Certainly they numbered in the tens of thousands.  They appeared to be much reduced by the time of the first French contacts with them in 1719, probably due in large part to epidemics of infectious disease to which they had no immunity. In 1790, it was estimated there were about 3,200 total Wichita. Conflict with Texans in the early 19th century and Americans in the mid 19th century led to a major decline in population, leading to the eventual merging of Wichita settlements. By 1868, the population was recorded as being 572 total Wichita. By the time of the census of 1937, there were only 100 Wichita officially left.\nIn 2018, 2,953 people were enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. In 2011, there were 2,501 enrolled Wichitas, 1,884 of whom lived in the state of Oklahoma. Enrollment in the tribe required a minimum blood quantum of 1/32.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKichai\nTawakoni\nTaovaya Indians\nWaco Indians\nCaddos\nComanches\nApaches\nLipan Apaches\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWichita and Affiliated Tribes, official website\nWichita, article in the Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture\nThe last word on 'Wichita'.

        "wiki": "Sedgwick County Memorial Hall and Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1911\u201313) is a Civil War monument on the grounds of the Old Sedgwick County Courthouse, in Wichita, Kansas. It was designed by E. M. Viquesney, with sculpture by Frederick Hibbard and the W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company.\nThe idea to construct a memorial to Sedgewick County Civil War veterans began with two local GAR posts in 1904, but sufficient funds were not available until in 1911. In that year the Kansas State Legislature passed a one-time county tax levy to fund the building of monuments in counties with a population of over 72,000.The monument consists of a Second Empire granite pavilion adorned with five statues.  Its dome is crowned by a hammered copper figure of Liberty holding a flag and a laurel wreath, made by the W. H. Mullins Company of Salem, Ohio. At the base of the dome are four life-sized bronze figures by Hibbard representing the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and Navy. Inscriptions on the monument's four facades list the battles, dates and locations in which local soldiers fought. The Liberty figure originally faced the courthouse, but after its installation the veterans decided that the statue should face outward. Rotating it 180 degrees delayed the monument's dedication from Lincoln's Birthday to Flag Day. The monument's interior features a Memorial Hall, 12 feet square, with two marble-and-glass cases displaying war relics. The Hall remained locked for 25 years because the key had been lost. The key was found again in 1948.The monument was dedicated June 14, 1913. It was restored (2000\u201301), and rededicated on Veterans Day, November 11, 2001.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n1913 in art\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Sedgwick County, Kansas\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Mid-America All-Indian Center is an American museum dedicated to the history and culture of Native Americans. The museum, which is located along the Arkansas River in the Riverside neighborhood of Wichita, Kansas, is considered the only facility solely dedicated to American Indian culture in the U.S. state of Kansas.\n\n\n== Mission and collection ==\nThe Mid-America All-Indian Center serves as a cultural center and museum dedicated to educating people about and preserving Native Americans heritage.\nThe museum's collection includes the largest publicly displayed body of artwork by Blackbear Bosin, the late Kiowa-Comanche sculptor and painter. Other notable pieces in the collection include beadwork, pipe bags, jewelry, pottery, and baskets. The museum has a large collection of Alaska Native artwork from the mid-20th century, as well as flags from over 70 American Indian tribes displayed in the Gallery of Nations event space.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mid-America All-Indian Center opened in 1976 as a cultural center and provider of social services to the Native American community. The original co-founders of the museum included Betty Nixon, a Kiowa artisan who later served as the chairwoman of the center's board of directors. The Mid-America All-Indian Center's social services were later abolished, as similar programs could be provided more easily by other agencies, such as the Salvation Army or United Way of the Plains.Jerry Martin, the current director of the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology at Wichita State University, was the museum's director from 1989 to 1999.By 2005, the Mid-America All-Indian Center was suffering from debt and mismanagement. The museum was suffering from a range of financial issues, including heavy debt and overdue bills. A number of artifacts were also missing from the collection.The city of Wichita took control of the Mid-America All-Indian Center in 2005 in an effort to save the center. The city government temporarily closed the Mid-America All-Indian Center following the take-over. The Mid-America All-Indian Center took out a $175,000 loan from the city of Wichita to pay overdue bills and other expenses. It repaid the loan within two years.The Wichita government and the Mid-America All-Indian Center also sought to trim costs and cut programs as part of the restructuring. The city reduced the center's staff from more than ten employees to just three staff members. The museum now has three full-time employees, as of 2015 \u2013 center director, April Scott; museum director, Sarah Adams; and education director, Crystal Flannery-Bachicha. City officials trimmed programs and cut the number of phone lines and websites.City officials also commissioned a new inventory of all artifacts housed at the Mid-America All-Indian Center. The collection was recorded, photographed and digitized. The museum's computer database were upgraded and modernized for better record keeping. All of the missing items from the collection were ultimately found.The Mid-America All-Indian Center now has an operating budget of approximately $440,000, as of 2012, with roughly 40,000 visitors per year. It brings in additional income from the rental of its entertainment and meeting spaces. The museum serves as a cultural center for the 10,000 American Indians residing in the Wichita metropolitan area, who represent seventy-two unique tribes from the Plains and other areas. The center hosts powwows and other cultural events. In 2011, the Mid-America All-Indian Center launched the first annual American Indian Festival, which is modeled after the Red Earth Festival held in Oklahoma City. The American Indian Festival was discontinued in 2015. They host fundraisers throughout the year \u2013 the two largest being the Mid-America All-Indian Center Benefit Car Show in the spring and the Mid-America All-Indian Center and Friends Culture Dash in the fall.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We visited here today, and we all agreed, it wasn\u2019t worth the price of admission. There is mostly artwork with a few artifacts thrown in (mainly moccasins). I would not recommend this place unless you are either bored or you absolutely must see Native American paintings. It",
          "A bit disappointing as they didn\u2019t have a lot of exhibits or history of the Plain Indians. What they had was interesting though. It was mostly art work by Bigbear Boisin which was impressive. Building and grounds seem to be mostly used as a meeting place, which would be very",

          "Kansa, Omaha, Wichita. My wife and I enjoyed our mid-May visit to Wichita's 'Mid-America, All-Indian Center' on rainy Wednesday morning. The MAAIC is many things: it is the city's attempt to understand and recall the Native American peoples that once lived in Kansas and gave",

          "This was our first trip to Wichita. Don't ask me why, our travels just never took us there before. Wichita is a very friendly and clean city, and alongside the downtown area, there are two rivers that intersect, The Arkansas River and the Little Arkansas River. That's where",
          "Not a large area but very well done. Book store very good and Bison life story on video worth the time.",

          "I tried to find a museum in the Blackwell/Ponca City OK area that compares to the Mid-America All-Indian Center. None came close to the content of this museum. There is plenty of Native American art & history to see. The gift shop warrants a visit too.",

          "As soon as you arrive, the history begins. Go when you have time to read all the wall plaques and watch the short videos. The art work is phenomenal and breathtaking. Great rainy day activity and the children will love the interactive areas. This is great year round.",
          "The Mid-America All-Indian Center is presents the history of the tribes in attractive exhibits and on the grounds. There is an actual tepee on the grounds along with other apparatus used by the Indians to move from place to place. The museum itself is not very large, but well",

          "One thing that is nice about the Mid-America All-Indian Center is that they don't overwhelm you with too much information. The exhibits here obviously change from time to time and the main ones we saw were the history of the Native Americans who worked in the Aviation Industry",
          "This is an interesting little place. It has quite a few meeting areas which is what I was there for. It did have quite a few educational areas and the grounds are beautiful. Parking is a bit sparse, but that leaves more of the grounds to enjoy.",

          "The exhibits were good, and so were the videos that explained the lives of some famous Native Americans, including an elderly one who did a personal interview (televised/on radio). The native american cookbooks and arts/crafts were interesting too. Will come back to the crafts",

          "I love the statue! I wish I could have been there in the evening when the flames were on. The center had some cool stuff as well and I loved the hand-made souvenirs you could buy. They were worth the money.",

          "A history that is well presented and lively dances make this educational and entertaining. The native indians are friendly and helpful. The tour shows how they lived, what they had to endure, how they made decisions (pow-wow) and how they celebrated life. The Center has easy",

          "The apparel and flags of the nations on display were interesting and beautiful, but there was a charge for the museum.......which turned out to be about 100 paintings by native americans.",
          "This museum has many art displays and few if no interactive exhibits. It is interesting in its own right, but probably needs a small expansion in their collection / interaction.",
          "Check the opening times, websites cant be really trusted. Call in especially if it is over certain holidays.",
          "High quality museum collection of items from all over the USA. Knowledgeable friendly staff. Excellent gift shop of unique items.Weekly events you can attend, and an outdoor example of traditional homes. Worth a visit! If you have the time, walk back to downtown Wichita along",
          "I was saddened to see how nice of a facility this is, but the lack of Native American \"museum\" items. They need help with that part.",
          "The all indian center is a cooperative of several tribes traditionally found in the area. There are artifacts, art objects including the \"keeper of the plains\" statue which is the symbol of wichita and created by the famous artist black bear bosin. many pow wows and activities",

          "I took my son who was 7 years at the time to this museum. It was really quite interesting particularly if you have any idea of the impact and significance of the Native American Indians on the area. My son loved the outdoor exhibits. We went through some of the artwork quick",
          "The museum was very small and it was mainly an art museum. Kids will find this very boring. I thought the village outside of the building was interesting but anybody could go there for free. The admittance fee was overpriced for this small museum."

        "wiki": "Luis Jimenez or Luis A. Jim\u00e9nez, Jr. (July 30, 1940 \u2013 June 13, 2006) was an American sculptor  of Mexican descent. He was born in El Paso, Texas, and died in New Mexico. He studied art and architecture at the University of Texas in Austin and El Paso, earning a bachelor's degree in 1964. He moved to New York City in 1966 after completing his post-graduate work at Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, D.F. He became an accomplished artist and taught art at the University of Arizona and later the University of Houston.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFor over 30 years, Jim\u00e9nez produced a consistent body of work informed by his highly developed craft skills, knowledge of art history and his own placement in time. Jim\u00e9nez was known for his large polychromed fiberglass sculptures usually of Southwestern and Hispanic themes. His works were often controversial and eminently recognizable because of their themes and the bright, colorful undulating surfaces that Jim\u00e9nez employed.  John Yau observes that one of the underlying reasons his public sculptures have been controversial is because he keeps bringing into view that which has been overlooked; he keeps reminding us that our history is made up of many points of view, many tales and tellings. A reexamination of the context and purpose of public sculpture and the making (writing) and remaking (rewriting) of the untold tales and popular myths about the formation of the continually changing American West.Jim\u00e9nez was influenced by the murals of Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera.  He was very much a contemporary artist whose roots are in pop art, as much as they are in both the modernism of the Mexican muralists and the regionalism of Benton and Grant Wood. Heroic sculptures were Jim\u00e9nez's forte, but his art is intended for the people. Proud of his Chicano heritage and working-class background, he champions the common man in his work. Working in his father's shop, making neon signs, as well as lowrider car culture, and featuring brightly painted fiberglass bodywork were also artistic influences. He unapologetically finds his images in stereotypes and magnifies those stereotypes into a kind of celebration. What makes Jimenez\u2019s sculpture come alive, what makes it sculptural, and also gives life to Olmec heads, Aztec serpents, and the statues of Rodin, and the totems of David Smith, is movement.\nIn 1993, Jim\u00e9nez was a recipient of the New Mexico Governor's Awards for Excellence in the Arts.

        "wiki": "Tilt-A-Whirl is a flat ride similar to the Waltzer in Europe, designed for commercial use at amusement parks, fairs, and carnivals, in which it is commonly found. The rides are manufactured by Larson International of Plainview, Texas.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe ride consists of seven freely-spinning cars that hold three or four riders each, which are attached at fixed pivot points on a rotating platform. As the platform rotates, parts of the platform are raised and lowered, with the resulting centrifugal and gravitational forces on the revolving cars causing them to spin in different directions and at variable speeds. The weight of passengers in these cars (as well as the weight distribution) may intensify or dampen the spinning motion of the cars, adding to the unpredictable nature known as chaotic motion.\nPhysicists Bret M. Huggard and Richard L. Kautz came up with a mathematical equation that approximates the motion of the Tilt-A-Whirl.\n\n\n== History ==\nHerbert Sellner invented the Tilt-A-Whirl in 1926 at his Faribault, Minnesota, home. In 1927, the first 14 Tilt-A-Whirls were built in Sellner's basement and yard. Sellner Manufacturing opened its factory in Faribault and the ride debuted at the Minnesota State Fair. More than a thousand rides were eventually built. Some of the rides produced in the 1940s and 1950s are still in operation.\nThe earliest Tilt-A-Whirls were constructed of wood, powered by gas motors, and featured nine cars. Modern rides are constructed of steel, aluminum and fiberglass, and it is powered by seven small electric motors, and has seven cars.In 1995, Tovah Sellner took over Sellner Manufacturing after the loss of her husband Bruce Sellner; her daughter Erin Sellner joined her in 1998 and the two of them ran the business together.\n\n\n== Modern Tilt-A-Whirls ==\nModern Tilt-A-Whirls cost in excess of US$300,000 to purchase.  A Tilt-A-Whirl package comes with a choice to employ either the famous domed tipkarts (which were introduced back during the 1930s), or Waltzer-style open squat podkarts having headrest bars (that option was introduced by Sellner Manufacturing in 2003).\nThe oldest operating Tilt-A-Whirl is a 1927 model, traveling with Tom Evans United Shows in the US Midwest. Between six- and seven hundred Tilt-A-Whirls are in operation.\nConneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania still has its original Tilt-A-Whirl from 1949.\nBessemer, Alabama's amusement park Alabama Splash Adventure introduced a Tilt-a-Whirl ride to the public on May 19, 2018.\n\n\n== Installations ==\n\n\n== Incidents and accidents ==\nOn September 22, 2018, A Tilt-A-Whirl operated by Thomas Amusements in St. John's, Newfoundland malfunctioned when two of the cars crashed into each other causing the top of one of the cars to fall off and on to the platform. No serious injuries resulted but some of the passengers suffered minor injuries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"It's been a tilting, whirling ride for 75 years,\" Minneapolis Star Tribune, 1-SEP-2001\nTilt-A-Whirl Chaos (I) Ivars Peterson's MathTrek\nTilt-A-Whirl Chaos (II) Ivars Peterson's MathTrek\nAmusement Ride Extravaganza \u2013 Tilt-A-Whirl\n\n\n== External links ==\nLarson International Inc.\nSellner Manufacturing Co.\nRandom Terrain's Tilt-A-Whirl Tribute\nAmusement Ride Extravaganza \u2013 Tilt-A-Whirl",

I love the piano game, and I'm an adult.  The games doesn't break as often as they use too.  We had troubles with probably two games and that was it.",

Half the games we played were out of tickets so we either had to wait for the one guy they had running around to refill the machine or loose our tickets.

        "wiki": "The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is a non-governmental organization headquartered at the Bronx Zoo in New York City, that aims to conserve the world's largest wild places in 14 priority regions. Founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society (NYZS), the organization is led by President and CEO Cristi\u00e1n Samper. WCS manages four New York City wildlife parks in addition to the Bronx Zoo: the Central Park Zoo, New York Aquarium, Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo. Together these parks receive 4 million visitors per year. All of the New York City facilities are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society was originally chartered by the state of New York on April 26, 1895. Then known as the New York Zoological Society, the organization embraced a mandate to advance wildlife conservation, promote the study of zoology, and create a first-class zoological park. Its name was changed to the Wildlife Conservation Society in 1993. Among the founders of WCS were Andrew H. Green, best known as the father of greater New York City, Henry Fairfield Osborn, Columbia University professor and curator of the American Museum of Natural History, and George Bird Grinnell, founder of the Audubon Society and editor of Forest and Stream Magazine. Theodore Roosevelt, Madison Grant, members of the Boone and Crockett Club, and other notable New Yorkers were also involved in the Society's creation.\nThe Bronx Zoo (formerly the New York Zoological Park) was designed along the lines of other cultural institutions in New York City, such as the American Museum of Natural History. The city provided the land for the new zoo and some funding for buildings and annual operating costs. WCS raised most of the funds for construction and operations from a private donor, and selected the scientific and administrative personnel.\n\n\n=== Work ===\nIn the late nineteenth century William Temple Hornaday, then director of the New York Zoological Park (now the Bronx Zoo), carried out a direct-mail survey of wildlife conditions through the United States, and publicized the decline of birds and mammals in the organization's annual reports. In 1897 Hornaday also hired field researcher Andrew J. Stone to survey the condition of wildlife in the territory of Alaska. On the basis of these studies, Hornaday led the campaign for new laws to protect the wildlife there and the United States as a whole. In 1901, a small herd of American Bison were gathered in a 20-acre meadow just off what is now the Pelham Parkway roadway. Starting in 1905, Hornaday led a national campaign to reintroduce the almost extinct bison to government sponsored refuges. Hornaday, Theodore Roosevelt and others formed the American Bison Society in 1905. The Bronx Zoo sent 15 bison to Wichita Reserve in 1907 and additional bison in later years. The saving of this uniquely American symbol is one of the great success stories in the history of wildlife conservation. Hornaday campaigned for wildlife protection throughout his thirty years as director of the Bronx Zoo. Beginning in 1906, Hornaday featured Ota Benga, a member of the Mbuti from the Congo, in a zoo exhibit. In July 2020, the Wildlife Conservation Society apologized.William Beebe, the first curator of birds at the Bronx Zoo, began a program of field research soon after the Bronx Zoo opened. His research on wild pheasants took him to Asia from 1908 to 1911 and resulted in a series of books on pheasants. Beebe's field work also resulted in the creation of the Society\u2019s Department of Tropical Research, which Beebe directed from 1922 until his retirement in 1948. Beebe\u2019s research in an undersea vessel called the bathysphere took him half a mile under the ocean floor off Bermuda in 1934 to record for the first time human observations of the bottom of the deep sea. The bathysphere is currently displayed at the New York Aquarium.\nThe war years marked the arrival of Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr as NYZS president and Laurance Rockefeller as executive committee chairman. A best selling writer on conservation and son of WCS founder Henry Fairfield Osborn, Osborn soon embraced changes that signaled new thinking in the organization. Guests were allowed to bring their own cameras into the Bronx Zoo, while animals were grouped by continents and ecosystems rather than genetic orders and families, beginning with the African Plains exhibit in 1941.After World War II, under the leadership of Osborn, the organization extended its programs in field biology and conservation. In 1946 WCS helped found the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park, which became part of Grand Teton National Park in 1962. In the late 1950s WCS began a series of wildlife surveys and projects in Kenya, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Burma, and the Malay peninsula. In 1959 it sponsored George Schaller\u2019s seminal study of mountain gorillas in Congo. Since that expedition, Schaller has gone on to become the world's preeminent field biologist, studying wildlife throughout Africa, Asia and South America. Conservation activities continued to expand under the leadership of William G. Conway, who became director of the Bronx Zoo in 1962 and President of WCS in 1992. Active as a field biologist in Patagonia, Conway promoted a new vision of zoos as conservation organizations, which cooperated in breeding endangered species. He also designed new types of zoo exhibits aimed at teaching visitors about habitats that support wildlife, and encouraged the expansion of WCS's field programs.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the WCS took a leadership role in pioneering zoological exhibitions by seeking to recreate natural environments for the animals on display. Under the leadership of WCS director William G. Conway, the Bronx Zoo opened its World of Darkness for nocturnal species in 1969 and its World of Birds for avian displays in 1974. Eventually New York City turned to WCS to renew and manage three city-run facilities in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. The redesigned Central Park Zoo opened in 1988, followed by the Queens Zoo in 1992 and the Prospect Park Zoo in 1993. From 1994 through 1996 Archie Carr III of WCS helped establish the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, a reserve for endangered jaguar.\nToday WCS is at work on some 500 projects in more than 60 nations around the world that are intended to help protect both wildlife and the wild places in which they live. The organization endeavors to protect 25 percent of the world's biodiversity\u2014from the gorillas of Africa and the tigers of Asia to macaws in South America and the sharks, whales and turtles traveling through the planet's seas. In recent years WCS has actively worked in conflict areas like Afghanistan, South Sudan and Myanmar, where agreements on wildlife resource have contributed to peace and stability. More than 4 million people visit WCS's wildlife parks in New York City each year.\n\n\n=== The Welikia Project ===\nThe Welikia Project is a project by the WCS to reconstruct and map how New York City looked in 1609 at the time of first contact with Europeans. Elements being mapped include where the streams flowed and where each species of tree grew. The Lenni Lenape people who lived there called the island Mannahatta, or \"land of many hills.\" The project highlights the ways that development has altered the natural ecosystems.\n\n\n=== Makira National Park ===\nIn 2001, in collaboration with the Madagascar Ministry of Environment and Forests, the WCS launched a program to create the 372,470 hectare Makira Forest Protected Area. In 2017, WCS partnered with carbon-reduction platform Cool Effect to allow users to fund ongoing carbon-reduction projects directly supporting the Makira Natural Park.\n\n\n=== Melanesia Program ===\nStacy Jupiter is the director of the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Melanesia Program. The Melanesia program focuses on conservation in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Melanesia contains a large amount of biodiversity and is home to the world\u2019s largest and highest tropical islands. Working on both land and sea, the Melanesia program works within the Bismarck Solomon Seas Ecoregion and the Bismarck Forest Corridor and strives to combine community involvement with conservation rooted in science to resolve issues such as habitat loss, degradation, overexploitation, and climate-change adaptation.\n\n\n== See also ==\n21st Century Tiger\nClimate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance\nLast of the Wild\nAmerican Bison Society\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nChampion Of Wildlife; Zoological Society at 100 The New York Times\n21st Century Tiger",

          "We live 3 hours away, we loved it so much, we purchased season passes. It's such an informative and interactive zoo. It's worth the extra money to feed the animals and do the interactions. Great for all ages, smaller sized but interactive enough for most activity levels",

          "I enjoyed it. My family that lives in KS were disappointed. They used to have more interaction with the animals. We were given 2 cranberries and once the lemurs took them we were rushed out. I like the kangaroos. The monkeys were very active especially after the tornado siren",

          "We visited because I am a penguin fanatic and the opportunity to swim with the penguins was on my bucket list. We had adults ages 19-90 and all had a great time. It was fun to see animals but also to be able to interact with them. The staff was friendly and very informative.",

          "Tanganyika Park is a great place to visit. You get to have great interactions with mini animals the price goes up a little if you want to interact with more animals but it is a tear thing. The more interactions you want cost a little more that is well worth the money. Children",

          "This is a wonderful, interactive, attraction. I don't really want to call it a 'zoo' because it is not just for viewing animals. You can feed giraffe's, tortoises, Lorikeets, goats, hippos, Lemurs, and other wildlife in a very safe, professional environment. TWP is a breeding",

          "All I can say is I got to feed a pygmy hippo. I love hippos ! We did the 5 encounter pass and totally found it worth the money. We chose to the the 5 instead of 10 because with the 5 we were able to do the large animals. All the staff was friendly and informative. I would go",
          "We are from Orlando and have done all the animal parks, but this one was super special. We were fortunate enough to go on a Wednesday during July where the kid pass was free if you had a paying adult. The general admission isn't too bad, however, it can add up once you start",
          "There were a lot of baby animals to watch. It was nice to pet some of the animals. It's too bad a law was passed that doesn't allow the animals to sit on your lap. We went to an exotic petting zoo in Orlando. Much more interaction with the animals there. But Tanganyika is",

          "This place is a must visit. They offer different types of entrance plans. We chose the General Admission $19.99, which gave you one \"animal encounter\" (this is via a coin they give you at purchase). Since I am not a big Zoo guy, I gave my encounter coin to my daughter. The",

          "I'm not a zoo kind of person, but the hands on, up close experience turned me into one. Although it's a fairly small zoo, it's one of the better ones I have been to. Feeding the giraffes and turtles, petting the Kangaroo's, and going on Lemur Island made the experience",

          "I've only been once but it's an experience I won't forget. The lemurs were so awesome. Plenty of staff to keep guests safe. It is a better environment then the zoo. It's a great learning experience especially when you interact with the lorikeets and giraffes. Great environment",
          "I would recommend this for all ages. Has some areas where you can pet the animals- Kangaroos, goats, turtles, kids area. I think the habitats are very nice sized. Great and friendly staff. Maybe in a few years-as they grow, a train or trolley would be handy for children/",
          "This is more than your regular zoo. You get to go very close to the animals and in a number of cases, feed them. The park was very clean and even had a few hand washing stations at the animal exits. Staff were very friendly. the concessions stand was a bit limited and not",

          "Quick day grip and SO worth it! We purchased tickets online to save a little and paid to upgrade for the VIP wristbands- do it! My kids had a BLAST feeding the animals, interacting with the animals, learning about the animals and enjoying the day! Highly recommend this for all",

          "Take my children here frequently when we're tired of the Sedgwick County Zoo. There are lots of feeding stations so that you can interact with animals. Prices for these feeding stations are bit high but make for a fun time. We always have a great time when we visit Tanganyika",
          "I plan an entire road trip around this visit every year. I was kind of disappointed this year, though. The lemur experience is not the same due to federal guidelines. You used to be able to sit down and the lemurs (ring tailed) would climb on you as you fed them. New regulations",
          "What an awesome experience, especially for children. Lots of feeding opportunities for the little ones, and a chance to pet several of the animals. The design of this park is very open and natural. It is very clean and the animals are all healthy and seem very content.",
          "Tanganyika is a medium sized animal park. There are lots of neat, wild animals to see. Several interactive experiences include: feeding giraffes, lorikeets, bunnies, tortoises, lemurs and goats. You can also have a camel ride or llama train ride. All of these experiences are fun",
          "Great place to take the entire family! Lots of interactive exhibits that you will find nowhere else in the country! Great little Goddard/Wichita area treasure!",
          "We've only been a couple times, once was a Halloween bash that I was rather disappointed in but the normal open day we went was fun. We got a bracelet to feed several animals and ride the camel. My daughter loved it. Would go back again if it didn't cost so much.",
          "I visited this Park over the weekend with my wife and two kids that are 6 and 7 as we were in KS for a wedding. This is an amazing \"zoo\" where you get to interact with many of the animals. My kids fed giraffes, rhinos, lemurs, rabbits, alpakas, goats and birds as well. The",
          "We loved this place! It was a very hot August day when we were there so it's a good thing that exhibits were close together. We had two five year olds and one two year old. They loved the experience especially feeding animals like the pygmy hippo, turtles and giraffes. Would",
          "Fantastic! Worth every penny. Our kids fed giraffes, rhinos, and lemurs. The park is immaculate, the animals seem very content, and the staff was attentive. Our favorite attraction in Wichita.",
          "This small zoo is great. Very clean and not very crowded. Being able to interact with some of the animals was great. My daughter was thrilled.",
          "It was the nicest zoo we have taken our grandchildren to! The interaction with the animals was an awesome and a great experience for them.",
          "My husband, 3 year old son and I went and of course upgraded to the wristbands because you get sooo many more opportunities to interact with the animals. The keepers even let the activities allowed with the wristbands be transferable so my husband and I let our son use our",
          "7/31/15 now getting here is fun due to all the road construction. They do give a military discount with proof. Take your time do not be in a rush enjoy the animals as you may never have the change to interact with this many different animals in one place again. Also remember to",
          "I have visited Tanganyika Park twice, both with small children. The first time, about two years ago, was a great experience. You could pay extra to feed the animals and they would interact with you. The highlight of the feeding experiences were the lemurs as they were very",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here. Good interaction with the animals for children and adults. Beautiful well kept grounds, attractive buildings and the animals looked well cared for and satisfied. Would recommend for families and school groups.",
          "I thought this wildlife park was really nice for being in the middle of the Kansas plains. I thought they had a good collection of animals to view. it appeared they had room for more animals and could have used a misting system to help cool the animals and visitors. It was",
          "Odd feeling for a zoo. Lots of exhibits just have fescue for their \"natural habitat\" along with wooden climbing/forts/toys. Penguin exhibit was literally a swimming pool and all the penguins were huddled under a grass umbrella. Baby exhibit at entry is definitely",
          "I love Tanganyika and if it didn't cost so much I would probably go more often. I love how you can interact with the different animals. My advice to you is to do the wrist band that allows you to feed several different animals it will save you some money!!",
          "We had such a fun time at Tanganyika!! Excellent wildlife park and up close encounters with some of the animals. We got to feed a giraffe, lorikeets, tortoise, rabbits, lemurs, etc. The kids absolutely had a ball and was a great experience for us adults too!! Very nice",
          "We found your ad in the Kansas state brochure at a rest stop and on our way back home to Wisconsin from Oklahoma we decided to stop by. Well worth the stop. Everyone who worked there was super nice. The prices were reasonable and the experience was one in a lifetime to someone",
          "I am a big fan of zoos, and Tanganyika is by far my favorite. It is smaller than many zoos, but the layout is very open. The only thing separating you from the giraffes is a little stream. They have a variety of exotic animals, many of which are not found at other zoos in",
          "Wanna visit a zoo? Don't. Go to the most interactive animal experience around! Tanganyika has something for everyone!",
          "We went to Tanganyika as a family on Father's Day weekend. We're all adults. We expected a nice leisurely stroll through a park. We were surprisingly wrong! It was definitely a nice leisurely stroll, but it wasn't through just a park! It was a walk through a clean, very",
          "We were there with a group and had an amazing time. Everyone extremely nice and helpful and treated our group as a VIP. The Zoo is clean and well cared for. All the animals seemed very healthy and happy. We loved the interactive part the best. IT is a must Visit ZOO if",
          "A really good interactive, privately owned zoo. The zoo was established for animal conservation but eventually opened it to the public. We were able to touch, feed and stroke the animals under the watchful and informative zoo keepers who are a wealth of information. The staff is",
          "This was our fourth trip to the park. We notice new additions each time. The Red Panda was new this time for us. The snow leopards had a good year as the five cubs were adorable and active in the nursery. The serval population has also increased. Great news for these",
          "We family and I enjoyed our visit to Tanganyika Wildlife Park. The giraffes were beautiful, the monkeys on the island were so entertaining, and the penguins were swimming! My kids loved feeding the tortoises, rabbits, and goats, and petting kangaroos was also very cool!",
          "My granddaughters 10 and 11 named this their favorite place to visit on a recent visit to Wichita. They liked to interactive opportunities with the animals. The band to do 2 premium things and about 10 other less exotic things is $10.00. Chose the premiums well;they had",
          "Had so much fun! My girls are older, 10 & 13, but they still loved it. TONS of interactive opportunities. Small, but jam packed so it seems much bigger. Down falls- no longer permitted to photo or touch lemurs. You can still feed, but they don't jump on you anymore. No",
          "This wildlife park is very well done. It is large enough to accommodate a good number of individuals. They have ample activities occurring that enable you to learn more about the animals on the premises. The white tiger exhibit was great. The big cat was interactive with the",
          "I like that it doesn't have all that hype that comes along with most of zoos. You get a real close encounter experience with the animals. Fun for all ages including adults.",
          "We go to a lot of zoos and this was great little zoo. The zoo is interactive! Children can feed bunnies, tortoises, a rhino, genie pigs, giraffes, lemurs, lorikeets, ride camels and lamas, feed goats and lamas, and walk with kangaroos. Be for warned, the only interactive",
          "Much better than any zoo experience we've ever had... lots of exhibits and opportunities to interact with and feed animals from the rhino to birds and giraffes! :-)",
          "This wild life park is basically an interactive zoo. Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. They seek to inform and inspire on the tours. A lot of areas encourage feeding of the animals. Our kids loved feeding the giraffes and the giant tortoises. I learned a lot I did not",
          "Really nice lay out, many interactive areas for kids to feed the animals, staff also walk around with different animals for people to touch/learn about. Great place!",
          "It's an awful shame we traveled 9 hours to show up to a massive group of 1,700 Girl Scouts! Imagine our distress and our children's dismay. I wish they would have let me know when I called the day before so I wouldn't have wasted my time. Took 20 minutes just to get out of the",
          "I visited this park with my sister and her kids and we had a blast! It's a far better experience than I've had at other wildlife facilities. There were multiple feeding and interaction opportunities with giraffe, lemur, bird, rhino, tortoise, rabbit, guinea pig, kangaroo and",
          "We have visited many zoos. This is not a zoo, it is an animal experience. Our children and visitors marveled as they touched and fed furry lemurs, experienced the long tongue of a giraffe reaching towards a tidbit, allowed brightly colored parrots to sip nectar from a cup and",
          "This place was expensive but well worth it, especially if you want to see kangaroos up close and personal. The animals appear to be well-cared for and the atmosphere was quote pro-family. We didn't eat or drink here, beyond water, but we did manage to come home with several",
          "Grandkids loved this experience. Feeding the animals and hearing first hand by a guide made this a superior animal learning experience.",
          "Traveling with a small child, it is important to have plenty of adventures. We went to Tanganyika Wildlife Park for a few hours. It is an impressive walking zoo that has a vast variety of animals. I was impressed with the kangaroos petting and the lemur experience both of which",
          "This year was the first year we went to their Halloween pumpkins in the park. It was a great time. My kids are 6 and younger so they were in total awwww. The park was lite up very nicely. The park personnel and candy distributors were dressed up and were very courteous.",
          "the ticket lady was very nice. But park rangers were very rude in giving instructions do a degree considered hostile behavior. My daughter was worried. I was NOT happy",
          "This was a really fun experience. I went with my sister and it was one of the best things we have done on vacation ever! We saw a wide range of animals and got to interact with several different animals. We also saw families with young children and the elderly/disabled",
          "This is an awesome wildlife park. The big cats are some of my favorites. It really has a one-of-a-kind lemur feeding experience. Those lemurs just love to jump around. It's a great place for families because there are several calm animals (like rabbits to feed) and the",
          "This place was more than I could have hoped for. It was a great and relaxing environment and very clean. We did the extra package so the kids could feed the animals and it was so worth it. The best part is feeding the lemurs. I enjoyed our visit so much more then if we go to the",
          "I loved this place. It was a great way to end our corporate conference. Lots of great pictures and a variety of animals. I wished I could have brought the kids.",
          "Visiting Tanganyika Park is an exciting experience. My granddaughters really enjoyed interacting with the lemurs, and also feeding the beautiful Lorikeets and other animals. The park is clean and beautifully landscaped We had a fun day.",
          "We recently visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. We decided to just go for the day and have lunch there as well. We met a friend there who is in a wheelchair. I was surprised to see that the gift shop was not handicap accessible. Though we definitely do not mind holding the door",
          "I took my 3 and 4 year old boys here and they loved it! It is expensive but worth the cost for a private zoo. This is like no other zoo I have been to due to the interaction with the animals. The boys got to feed a giraffe, rabbits, tortoises, goats, chickens, birds, lemurs,",
          "It may be small but it's a fantastic place to visit! Tanganyika is a most beautiful place to walk and see the animals. I like the fact it's so open. Our favorite part is feeding the lemurs and the giraffes. A must see when you are in the Wichita area.",
          "A wondeful zoo. The grounds were beautiful, enclosures excellent, and the giraffe and rhino feeding were top notch. Great place, great staff!",
          "Last time we were there, to feed the lemurs you bought a cup of craisins for $2, now you only get 1 piece for $2! I can understand not wanting to overload them, but that was kind of a rip off. For some reason the attendant gave at least 3 or 4 pieces to another guest, but after",
          "Visited last year and had a blast, so much so I planned another trip just to visit again. Didn't disappoint. The zoo is well laid out and relatively small, the scenery is beautiful. There are so many kinds of animals and they've got cubs right up front (cute overload). They've",
          "I took my family to Tanganyika last week and we had a blast. It is a little pricey at first when you pay. However keep in mind you are paying to ride camels, feed tortoises and giraffes. You also get to have lemurs eat from your hands and the kangaroo petting area is so cool.",
          "My friend and I and our grandkids - 2 10 year olds and a 12 year old. thoroughly enjoyed our day at this park. It was clean, beautifully landscaped and so much fun. We loved the lemurs, the giraffes, the kangaroos - oh we loved them all. The interaction with the animals was",
          "We have been to zoos all over the US including the San Diego Zoo several times. I really think the level of interaction here cannot be surpassed anywhere. Just buy the wristband for $10 that gets you into all the interactive areas without buying additional tokens in the park.",
          "It had all sorts of animals and you could get real upclose and personal with them and they would crawl and land on you ( lemurs and birds) and you could feedl the rinocerous. All in all it was a truly hidden gem right near wichita",
          "The experience was extremely fun and i look forward to coming back. I loved being able to interact with most of the animals. I also felt the feeding bracelets were a terrific deal and i got more out of the experience by purchasing the bracelet.",
          "This wildlife park is well worth the money. There were 5 adults and 5 kids in our group and it was very easy to navigate this park. Several exhibits were hands on. For example you can pet the kangaroos and feed the exotic birds. We brought in our lunch but there were options",
          "It was a most relaxing and rewarding experience. Betty and I love to walk and get out into nature. It was very meditative.",
          "I am not one for zoos but my best friend works here and went to support her. I had such a fun time and even returned for a second time. It is not your typical zoo experience since you get to feed and interact with the animals. My favorites were the giraffes and the kangaroos!!",
          "Pretty cool! I had a wonderful visit with my family! The poeple r very nice and know what they're doing most of the time. We were told many different contradicting things, such as times, petting, feeding etc.Though there's a few things that could have been better. Such as the",
          "We took my grandkids to the park and they loved being able to interact with the animals. It was really fun watching them with the lemurs and feeding the giant tortoises. They definitely want to come back again!",
          "What a fun animal experience! My family reunion made a visit here, so we had people of all ages (from newborn to 85), and everyone had a blast! Zoos are fun and all, but being able to feed the animals is just really hard to beat! And while the park is good-sized, it's not",
          "We love zoo's but this place is better than a zoo! There are lots of animals you can pet or feed which is wonderful for the kids. The place is well taken care of and the staff is great. Great for a day visit and not to big that kids get tired before you see everything. A",
          "A zoo is a zoo is a zoo. Tanganyika is different. My guy got to pet a Cerval. At the front of the park, they have a place where the babies are... you can feed the lemurs, giraffes, lorikeets and rhino, and pet the kangaroos. We were there a few weeks ago when the goats",
          "Liked that all the animals were up close and you could see them. When we paid, we were offered, for extra $, to get tokens or an arm band to feed and pet the animals. I asked if you could still pet all the animals even if you didn't feed them, and they said yes. That wasn't",
          "This was a very pleasant surprise just outside of Wichita, KS. The park looks to be brand new, even though it has been around for a while. Outside of a drive-through safari park in the US, this is the closest one can get to the animals. Being able to feed a giraffe, lemurs,",
          "We went here for Spring Break. It was VERY busy, waited in line for 30-40 mins. The line for the lemurs was also very long and we decided to skip that. The kangaroos were super neat! There were alot of animals not very active, but I assume it was because it was alittle chilly",
          "This was the most unique zoo like experience my family and I had every experienced. A great setting, a well taken care of venue, and a truly unique experience. Significantly more expensive than most zoo's, but worth the money. They only have a reciprocal membership agreement",
          "Like all the other reviews have said....WOW this place is amazing! If you just want to spend the day or have wedding, reunion or even a business meeting this is the place to do it. This facility does not receive any local or state money it is all privately funded. So please",
          "We LOVED this wildlife park! We read all the reviews and knew it would cost extra to feed the animals but it was worth the price to have such an experience! We fed Rhinoceros, Lories which landed on your arms, shoulders & head, Tortoises, Bunnies, Guinea Pigs, Giraffe, Ring",
          "This is a must if you are near Wichita. They have baby animals you can view in their nursery. Then as you go through the different areas you can purchase food for some animals and feed them. The highlight for my family is feeding the Lemurs. This is something you'll remember",
          "We visited last summer, sorry I'm late with my comments. This is a wonderful outing! The park is privately owned by a family. All the exhibits and animals are well cared for and the staff is very well informed. We had a great time and turn some fantastic pictures. You can",
          "The wildlife park is a wonderful place to visit and the value pass is great. This is the only place I know of where you can feed a rhino! What an experience! Everyone should experience this place.",
          "We hit the park during the daytime and then did the Halloween festivities during the evening. There was a full moon out which really set the tone for the evening. Super fun activity for the entire family. We love the collection of animals. From feeding the reticulated giraffes",
          "This is a way to spend 2-3 hours with kids in a fun location. It is small enough so that you can see everything, and the best part about it is, it is very interactive. You can feed giraffes and the rhino, not something you can do everywhere. You can also feed the Lorakeets.",
          "Relaxed, friendly, immaculate grounds. Friendly staff. Happy animals - !!!! Great selection of different type of animals...up close and personal experience areas are great. The petting area is nice for kids along with the playground Highly recommended",
          "I typically hate going to zoo's, but with three small children I suffer through it yearly. Tanganyika is the only zoo I have ever been to that I actually enjoyed being there. It's small enough you don't get lost, clean, nice staff, and you get to touch/see the animals up close.",
          "Living near Brookfield Zoo, which I highly praise even over the famous San Diego Zoo and (visited both) but Tanganyika Wildlife Park beats the best! The place is unlike any other park I've been to. You can feed giraffes, birds, RINOS!! etc. You can walk among the kangaroos!",
          "One of the best experiences of my life. Interaction with exotic animals including a rhino named Henry and ring tailed lemurs. These extra interactions do cost more but they are well worth it. Very beautiful and well kept park with healthy and happy animals. Will be returning as",
          "This is one of the most wonderful zoo like places I've ever been. It was so cool to have the opportunity to feed and pet different animals, it was an experience like none other. I would recommend this to anyone who has the chance to visit.",
          "Tanganyika offers the rare opportunity to pet a Giraffe! Feed Lemurs, Tortoise's and a Rhino. Children love the playground.",
          "This wildlife park may be small, but if you want up close views of the animals, and several great ways to get closer to some of them, this is the place. You can feed and touch the giraffes, and the rhino. You can touch the kangaroos, be on the same small island the lemurs are",
          "I took my first graders to Tanganyika for a field trip in May.Both the kids and the parents loved it! They got to pet kangaroos, feed tortoises and have birds sit on their hands! The could also feed a giraffe, lemur , or Rhino! It is a very pretty place and you feel like you are",
          "Very informative wildlife park. Liked the animal exhibit areas. Areas were kept clean. Many of the exhibits you can have some hands-on contact with animals. Wildlife employees were all very informed about their animals. Be sure to have camera ready to get many great shots. I do",
          "We're from Tampa visiting family and wanted to do something fun. We found Tanganyika Wildlife Park amazingly fun. Here's all that was good: friendly helpful staff, clean, beautiful animals, well kept enclosures, peaceful. The hands on opportunities with animals were worth every",
          "My fiancee and I attended the park on the 4th of July due to a discounted entry rate. We arrived as the park opened and were enjoying ourselves from the very beginning. The park is much neater and well kept than many other small wildlife parks that I have been to, so I was very",
          "Come early in the morning, buy the armbands that allow feedings of the animals. Right from the start, the nursery provided captivating entertainment in the former a baby clouded leopard which was tussling incessantly with its soft toy. We proceeded to feed the giraffes with",
          "My husband and I took our two kids to the park. They really enjoyed themselves. Everyone's favorite part was feeding the lemurs.",
          "Having worked in the city of Goddard for five years, I can't believe I never visited this place. The family had a wonderful time last weekend. The kids love the animals. This is a great place for a family outing.",
          "What a fun place to visit. No this isn't the Omaha or the Segwick county zoo, but for a smaller zoo that doesn't receive any government funding, it is a great place. You can interact with lots of different animals. Grounds were very clean and staff was extremely friendly and",
          "My daughter is a student at Kansas State and she heard about this place from some friends. On Move Out weekend we packed up her stuff and headed down to see this place. We had a ton of fun. She fed Kangaroos, Giraffes, and Rhinos. The staff made sure we had a good time. The",
          "Kansas earned a gold star in my book, for having such an awesome park! This was our first time visiting and won't be our last! Staff was very friendly and knowledgable. Park was clean and set up nice. Took our young kids (4 & 1) and they had a great time. I'd recommend buying",
          "We went on a Friday and had a wonderful time. I got the armband for $9 and got to feed the birds, giraffe, rhinoceros, and the lemurs. I had a great time and it was a great deal. The only problem I had was that there were not enough places to sit down. I am 7 months pregnant",
          "The first time we went to Tanganyika was Mother's Day 2012, we were hooked instantly. A few weeks later we purchased an annual membership. We visited the park more than 20 times last year. This year we've been three times. All of the staff and volunteers are pleasant, helpful,",
          "Had a wonderful time....it is better to go when it is not hot.....more animals are out and active... Definitely go pet the kangaroos and feed the birds, I would skip the camel ride though, it was a little disappointing...lemur island is a definite gotta do activity",
          "I have taken my son 3 times now & he loves it!! So neat to be able to touch a Kangaroo, feed rabbits, tortius, a rhino (if you choose), Lemer's are my most favorite, ride a Camel, Feed a Giraff, so many other animals as well...its very friendly & interactive w/the animals.",
          "I'm giving this review from a couple different perspectives. First, as a father of two toddler boys (6 and 4), and also as an avid photographer. My most recent zoo trips have been to the zoos in KC and Omaha. I would definitely rank Tanganyika above those zoos for the following",
          "This is not as big as some zoo's but it is much more close up. Kids love it. They have most of the usual selection of animals. Usually have some new ones that have been born on display. Opportunities to pet and touch several animals. Take the kids!",
          "I have been to this park several times. My grand daughter loves it way more than the actual zoo here locally. It's a smaller park...more intimate for visitors. You are able to get right up to feed the giraffes, go inside the Lorikeets (sp?) cages and for a few cents for",
          "We took a group of elementary children to the park. The animals were nice to look at and we could get very close to the giraffes. There were bunnies to feed, and see the animal nursery. There was a place to buy something to eat.",
          "My wife heard about this Wildlife park from a co- worker and just had to go check it out. We had a 3 hour one way drive to get there but was worth going to. Great facility and grounds. Everything so clean and modern. Prices very reasonable and all the staff people are just",
          "So wished we had time to go here more often, it is a wonderful place to visit. The staff is full of information on the animals and you get to touch and hold some of them. I love Tanganika Wildlife park and so do the children!!",
          "Went with my sister and nieces. They loved how close they could get to the animals and pet them. We paid the extra for \"tokens\" allowing them to feed the animals. Small enough to cover the park with two kids in two hours, but large enough to see a lot of animals. Maybe a little",
          "Great For Kids and Adults. So glad we have this drive through park, and kids can experience the animals.",
          "We visited for their Halloween activiites...trick or treat around the park, hay rack ride, haunted house, etc. Had a wonderful time with our 11 year old.",
          "I have visited 5 of the worlds top 10 zoos, including the Zoos in San Diego, Calgary, Mexico City and Washington D.C.. That being said none is like Tanganyika, it may be a little a out of the way, but you have the ability hand feed lemurs (to my knowledge only place in N.",
          "This is the place to interact with the animals and have fun. I bought some tokens to feed the lorikeets and goats. Rabbits can also be fed. I placed 50 cents into the machine to feed the koi fish. I enjoyed the lorikeet feeding the most. Lorikeets landed all over me,",
          "I have taken my daughter to the zoo several times and we always have fun! The animals are always awake. I we love the zoo and can't wait to go again this season!",
          "After going once, my husband and I upgraded to a season pass. It's a small zoo so don't come expecting long walks and an all day adventure like Wichita or Kansas City Zoo. It completely makes up for the size by being much more intimate and interactive. For a small additional fee",
          "At no other zoo or wildlife park can you get as up-close to animals as you can at Tanganyika. You can feed lemurs, lorikeets, giraffes, even a rhino! The staff are friendly and personable, know a lot about the animals, and bring animals out for you to see and touch. Best of all,",
          "I was blown away the first time I walked into Tanganyika. It's so open and interactive. I'd never been to a place like it. We got the membership that day, because we knew we'd be back again and again! We went all year in 2012, but I'm sorry to say we've just moved to another",
          "We never get tired of going! Tanganyika, while not nearly as large as the SC Zoo, has a HUGE selection of animals for its size. Where else can you ride a camel, pet a giraffe, feed a rhino, and see so many endangered offspring?! Tanganika has friendly well-educated staff who",
          "My husband and I took an afternoon and visited Tanganyika. He was able to feed a Rino, we fed Giraffes, pet Kangaroos, birds and even Lemurs! if you want to get up close and personal with these creatures, Tanganyika provides a safe and fun environmental for ages to enjoy. We",
          "My family loves going to Tanganyika! We have season tickets and enjoy it more every time we go. We love the fact that we can interact with a lot of the animals, and have seen several animals that we haven't seen in some zoos. My son was especially impressed that he got to pet a",
          "My girls had a blast at the wildlife park. I love the fact that you don't have to march everywhere you go just to see it all! My girls love to feed the animals and I love the fact that it is a local small business we are supporting!",

          "This has to be challenger for the most over-hyped attraction in the state of Kansas. I think the old ticket lady is the owners mother or something. What sourpuss. Very disappointed. Over hyped, over priced, it is about as satisfying as bad Chinese food and will leave you",

          "I went with quite a few family members, children included. I had a great time! I liked feeding the birds off of my fingers, having the lemurs (?) romp and play on my lap. The price is kind of high but the animals are worth it. Lots of interaction with both animals and",

          "We really had a great time. A different experience being so close to the animals, having them eat out of you hands or being able to hold them. I took my two neices who are 8 and 13 and they were amazed and thought it was alot of fun. Take extra money though. After you pay the",
          "My husband and I took our \"littles\" to Tanganyika for an outing. They really enjoyed getting to interact and feed the giraffes, lorikeets, lemur, goats, rabbits, kangaroo, and turtle. What an experience for them. I would prefer purchasing the tokens with the entrance fee.",
          "Such an enjoyable experience! The interactive nature of the park makes it a great place to bring kids. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The park is an over the top wonderful experience. Rhinos, Kangaroos, Birds, Monkeys, Giraffes, this place has it all.",
          "We took our 12 year old grandchild here the 2nd weekend in August - and had a blast! The park (http://www.twpark.com) is small compare to other zoos but this one is a must-do. I'll skip the part of how great the park is taken care of as well as the animals. Other writers",

          "We loved this park. It's not big, which is great for kids, and gives plenty of time to see everything without feeling rushed. The staff was friendly and helpful. They take very good care of the grounds and the animals appear well taken care of and loved. We especially liked",
          "My daughter and I went to Tanganyika Wildlife Park this past week and we were amazed at such an awesome interactive experience in Kansas! We got to play with kangaroos, feed lemurs (and have them jump ALL OVER us), feed and hold lorikeets, hug a giraffe, and my daughter had a",

          "My wife and I had a great time at the wildlife park. The park was well maintained and the personnel were friendly and knowledgeable. The smaller size of the park allowed for a much better look at the animals as compared to a larger zoo. I would recommend a visit to this park if",
          "We took advantage of the July 4th $4 entry fee and really enjoyed the time we spent there. Some of the staff need a lesson or two in customer service. However this did not spoil our day nor did it take away from the fact the place is very clean, nicely laid out and all in all",
          "We visited today, our first visit. We were fortunate that as it's July 4th there was a $4 per person special for admission. I found the park to be well maintained, and the animals seemed to be in better habitats than many of the Government funded zooz we have visited. We",
          "I was very happy with my visit to the park. Being from Washington State the price for admission was nothing out of the ordinary for me as this is close to admission for zoos in my area. I also work in the animal care field and know that in order to care for animals, especially",
          "I agree it is pricey but few places can you pet a kangaroo, feed a rhinoceros, larakeet, tortoise, bunny, alpaca, lemur, giraffe, and ride a camel. I think it is,so great for small children. The feeding does cost extra so be prepared, but since it is privately owned with no",

          "My boyfriend and I visited TWP today for the first time and I can't even begin to express how fantastic it was. For not having any funding from the state/federal gov't it is a VERY nice facility. I'm so glad to see that they get enough private funding to have this facility open",

          "We went to the park on a Saturday and it wasn't very packed. I think my favorite part about this place is that it is so open. There is no fence containing the giraffes just a revine that went all the way around them. It was pretty cool. The landscape is nice. We were hoping",
          "We really didn't get to see too much more than the Zoo",

          "This is such a fun place to visit. Smaller than a zoo. More interaction. They have a baby nursery up near the front where you can see baby animals that have just been born. The \"teenage\" white tigers were also up near the front. You can go in and feed the lemurs. You cant pet",
          "great experience with wildlife but pretty expensive unless you go with a discounted admission date (like half priced).",
          "I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of animals that Tanganyika has. Be sure and take some extra money along to buy tokens to get food for the animals! To be an independently owned park, I think this is one of the nicest I've seen!",
          "If you like to have hands on adventures with animals its worth it to make the drive and try it. Im not a big animal lover nor do I like to be too close to the animals but its fun just to see all the people interacting with them. The lemurs seem to be the hit at this place.",
          "My husband and I are experienced and enthusiastic wildlife park tourists, having passes for years to both the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park (formerly the SDZ Wild Animal Park), and always making wildlife parks a must on our itineraries when we travel. We were",

          "Our kids are 2 and 5. They loved getting to feed the giraffe and the lemurs. The park is new, clean, and laid out well. We saw all the animals, played on the excellent playground, and ate a packed lunch in about 4 hours. There were also some cute baby animals to look at.",

          "Tanganyika Wildlife Park was incredible. It was like a really big petting zoo. The lemurs were by far the best attradction that I came across. You get to feed them and they are able to climb up on your lap and eat from your hands. There is also a kangaroo area where you can pet",
          "Everyone has their favorite local zoo, and there are the heavyweights like the San Diego Zoo and the Washington D.C. zoo. Why would Tanganyika Wildlife Park in Goddard, Kansas (suburb of Wichita) be worth a visit? Tanganyika is named after the east African territory that is",
          "Wonderful staff and a fresh approach to a zoo. Really enjoyed the kangaroos and seeing the baby animals in the nursery. Very well done facility. Thanks!",
          "Tanganyika Wildlife Park is fantastic. It is much smaller than the zoo, but it is just the perfect size if you only have a couple of hours to spend. Sometimes you have to spend an entire day at the zoo just to see everything. At Tanganyika, a couple of hours is sufficient."

        "wiki": "Sedgwick County (county code: SG) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas.  The county seat is Wichita, the most populous city in the state. As of the 2010 census, the population was 498,365 with a 2019 estimate of 516,042 making it the second most populous county in Kansas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France.\nIn 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican\u2013American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nSedgwick County was founded in 1867, and named after John Sedgwick, who was a Major General in the Union Army during the American Civil War.In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north-south from Herington to Caldwell.  This branch line connected Herington, Lost Springs, Lincolnville, Antelope, Marion, Aulne, Peabody, Elbing, Whitewater, Furley, Kechi, Wichita, Peck, Corbin, Wellington, Caldwell.  By 1893, this branch line was incrementally built to Fort Worth, Texas.  This line is called the \"OKT\".  The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad.  Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Rock Island\".\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nSedgwick County was the setting for the murders committed by the BTK strangler from 1974 until 1991.  Dennis Rader, an employee of the Sedgwick County city of Park City was arrested in early 2005 after he began sending incriminating letters taunting the police in 2004. He had not been heard from since 1979. Ken Landwehr of the Wichita Police Department led the task force which captured Rader, setting a new standard of serial crime detection in the process, which is still studied by police departments across the world. Rader is serving 10 life sentences at the El Dorado Correctional Facility in El Dorado.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,009 square miles (2,610 km2), of which 998 square miles (2,580 km2) is land and 12 square miles (31 km2) (1.2%) is water.\n\n\n=== Adjacent counties ===\nHarvey County (north)\nButler County (east)\nCowley County (southeast)\nSumner County (south)\nKingman County (west)\nReno County (northwest)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nSedgwick County is part of the Wichita, KS Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 452,869 people, 176,444 households, and 117,688 families residing in the county.

          "I love this park!! 18 hole putt putt golf, pony rides, paddle boats, a  really nice playground and a pond that you can fish at. A walking/jogging trail. Green grass and well maintained.

        "wiki": "Wichita ( WITCH-i-taw) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Sedgwick County. As of 2019, the estimated population of the city was 389,938. Wichita is the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 644,888 in 2018.Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown.\"In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city became an aircraft production hub known as \"The Air Capital of the World.\" Textron Aviation, Learjet, Airbus, and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American aircraft industry. Wichita is also home to McConnell Air Force Base, and Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, the largest airport in Kansas.\nAs an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena and Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center. The city's Old Cowtown Museum maintains historical artifacts and exhibits on the city's early history. Wichita State University is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 B.C. In 1541, a Spanish expedition led by explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the area populated by the Quivira, or Wichita, people. Conflict with the Osage in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to European settlement of the region, the site was in the territory of the Kiowa.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nClaimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it became part of Kansas Territory in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.The Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in Indian Territory by Confederate forces in the American Civil War, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to Texas which became known as the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.In 1868, trader James R. Mead was among a group of investors who established a town company and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and German immigrant William \"Dutch Bill\" Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city's first streets. Wichita formally incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870.\n\nWichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". Across the Arkansas River, the town of Delano became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement. The area had a reputation for violence until local lawmen, Wyatt Earp among them, began to assertively police the cowboys. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to Dodge City. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.Rapid immigration resulted in a speculative land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into Wichita State University, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became Friends University, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after Kansas City and Topeka with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, there were five operating refineries in Wichita with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded Derby Oil, and Fred C. Koch, who established what would become Koch Industries, both began in Wichita during this period.The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited Chicago aircraft builder Emil \"Matty\" Laird to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the Swallow Airplane Company. Two early Swallow employees, Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, Stearman Aircraft in 1926 and Beechcraft in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started his own company in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the \"Air Capital of the World\" in 1929.\n\nOver the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman's Wichita facilities became part of Boeing which would become the city's largest employer. Initial construction of Wichita Municipal Airport finished southeast of the city in 1935. During World War II, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bomber. In 1951, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish McConnell Air Force Base. By 1954, all non-military air traffic had shifted to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport west of the city. In 1962, Lear Jet Corporation opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health care products maker Mentholatum in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping gear retailer Coleman started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of fast food franchises started in Wichita, beginning with White Castle in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including Pizza Hut in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.Wichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous temperance extremist Carrie Nation struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas's prohibition ordinance. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for desegregation. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of George Tiller. Tiller was later killed in Wichita by an extremist in 2009.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nExcept for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to re-develop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. Intrust Bank Arena opened downtown in 2010.Boeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus maintaining facilities in Wichita.Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the Kansas native and U.S. President in 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDowntown Wichita is at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111), at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m). Wichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 54. Part of the Midwestern United States, it is 157 mi (253 km) north of Oklahoma City, 181 mi (291 km) southwest of Kansas City, and 439 mi (707 km) east-southeast of Denver.The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area's topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies Chisholm Creek, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks as well as, further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 163.59 sq mi (423.70 km2), of which 159.29 sq mi (412.56 km2) is land and 4.30 sq mi (11.14 km2) is water.As the core of the Wichita metropolitan area, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, Valley Center, Park City, Kechi, and Bel Aire. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is Eastborough. Adjacent to the city's east side is Andover. McConnell Air Force Base is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, are Derby and Haysville. Goddard and Maize border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWichita lies within the transitional zone of the humid subtropical climate zone and the humid continental climate zone (K\u00f6ppen Cfa/Dfa), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the Great Plains, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer months. These occasionally bring large hail as well as frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history: in September 1965; during the Andover, Kansas Tornado Outbreak of April 1991; and during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s while cold air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0 \u00b0F. Wind speed in the city averages 13 mph (21 km/h). On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and June the wettest.The average temperature in the city is 56.9 \u00b0F (13.8 \u00b0C). Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 32.2 \u00b0F (0.1 \u00b0C) in January to 81.1 \u00b0F (27.3 \u00b0C) in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) an average of 62 days a year and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) on an average 8.5 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was \u221222 \u00b0F (\u221230 \u00b0C) on February 12, 1899. Readings as low as \u221217 \u00b0F (\u221227 \u00b0C) and as high as 111 \u00b0F (44 \u00b0C) occurred as recently as February 10, 2011 and July 29\u201330, 2012, respectively. Wichita receives on average about 32.69 inches (830 mm) of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 88 days of measurable precipitation. The average relative humidity is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages 15.6 inches (40 cm). Measurable snowfall occurs an average of ten days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on five of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 15 days a year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 26 through April 11.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nWichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The downtown area is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the Epic Center. Old Town is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.\nTwo notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the 120-acre (0.49 km2) Riverside Park. upscale College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city.Four other historic neighborhoods\u2014developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near Boeing, Cessna and Beech aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary World War II housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 51st largest city in the United States. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,304.8 per square mile (889.9/km2). There were 167,310 housing units at an average density of 1,022.1 per square mile (475.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% White, 11.5% African American, 4.8% Asian, 1.2% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 15.3% of the population.Of the 151,818 households, 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a male householder with no wife present, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families. 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48, and the average family size was 3.14.The median age in the city was 33.9 years. 26.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.The median income for a household in the city was $44,477, and the median income for a family was $57,088.

About 12.1% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nWichita is the principal city of both the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Wichita-Winfield Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, Butler, Harvey, and Sumner counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.The larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes Cowley County and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby Reno County is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIt is the birthplace of famous restaurants such as White Castle and Pizza Hut. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top 25 Kansas-based brands such as Koch, Coleman, Cessna, Pizza Hut, Beechcraft, Freddy's and more are based in Wichita.Wichita's principal industrial sector is manufacturing, which accounted for 21.6 percent of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.Healthcare is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing approximately 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical care tower at Wesley Medical Center. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system's fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children's Hospital, the first and only children's hospital in the Wichita area.Thanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring Butler County, Kansas, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former Derby Oil Company, which was purchased by Coastal Corporation in 1988. Wichita is home to oil & natural gas organizations Kansas Strong and Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association (KIOGA)\nKoch Industries and Cargill, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. Cargill Meat Solutions Div., at one time the nation's 3rd-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer Chance Morgan, gourmet food retailer Dean & Deluca, renewable energy company Alternative Energy Solutions, and Coleman Company, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. Air Midwest, the nation's first officially certificated \"commuter\" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's 8th largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was: 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).The cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0. As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.Wichita has a national reputation in U.S. media as an affordable and pleasant place to live. In July 2006, CNN/Money and Money ranked Wichita ninth on their list of the 10 best U.S. big cities in which to live.  In 2008, MSN Real Estate ranked Wichita 1st on its list of most affordable cities.  Wichita was also named the most \"Uniquely American\" city by Newsmax magazine in a May 2009 piece written by Peter Greenberg.  However, in its 2019 \"Best Places to Live\" survey, U. S. News & World Report, ranked Wichita at #79 out of 125 U.S. cities, and noted that violent crime in Wichita had risen over the previous few years.  In the 2019 KIDS COUNT Data Book, in its annual \"State Rankings on Overall Child Well-Being,\" Kansas was ranked No. 15 out of the 50 states. However, the state has a significantly higher rate of child incarceration than the nation, generally, and a higher rate of the state taking children from their homes.\n\n\n=== Aircraft manufacturing ===\n\nFrom the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, \"Matty\" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, Al Mooney and Bill Lear began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that would lead to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations E. M. Laird Aviation Company (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), Travel Air (started by Beech, Stearman and Cessna), Stearman, Cessna, Beechcraft and Mooney were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932.  By 1931, Boeing (of Seattle, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating \"Boeing-Wichita\", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita having merged into Textron Aviation in 2014, along with Learjet and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and Bombardier (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to depress the aviation sub-sector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., Hawker Beechcraft and Raytheon Aircraft Co.\u2014to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users. In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine light aircraft to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for Spirit Aerosystems to open its plant.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nWichita has a complex cultural mix, dominated by Euro-American, blue-collar industrial and rural tastes, but embracing, to various degrees, classical arts and music, diverse domestic and foreign cultures (Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian, British and Irish cultural influences and activities are conspicuous), and avant garde cultural activity.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nWichita is a cultural center for Kansas, home to several art museums and performing arts groups. The Wichita Art Museum is the largest art museum in the state of Kansas and contains 7,000 works in permanent collections. The Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University is a modern and contemporary art museum with over 6,300 works in its permanent collection.Small art galleries are scattered around the city with some clustered in the districts of Old Town, Delano and south Commerce street. These galleries started the Final Friday Gallery crawl event, where visitors tour attractions free in the evening on the last Friday of each month. Larger museums began participating and staying open late on Final Fridays shortly after its beginning.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nWichita is the music hub of central Kansas, and draws major acts from around the world, performing at various concert halls, arenas and stadiums around the area. Most major rock'n'roll and pop-music stars, and virtually all country music stars, perform there during their career.\nMusic Theatre Wichita, Wichita Grand Opera (both nationally renowned), and the Wichita Symphony Orchestra perform regularly at the Century II Convention Hall downtown. Concerts are also regularly performed by the nationally noted schools of music at Wichita's two largest universities.The Orpheum Theatre, a classic movie palace built in 1922, serves as a downtown venue for smaller shows.\nWichita is alleged to be the birthplace of the electric guitar, the fuzz box, and other key innovations in rock'n'roll music.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThe Wichita River Festival has been held in the Downtown and Old Town areas of the city since 1972. It has featured events, musical entertainment, sporting events, traveling exhibits, cultural and historical activities, plays, interactive children's events, a flea market, river events, a parade, block parties, a food court, fireworks, and souvenirs for the roughly 370,000+ patrons who attend each year.  In 2011, the festival was moved from May to June because of rain during previous festivals. The Wichita River Festival has seen immense growth, with record numbers in 2016 and again in 2018. Much of that growth is attributed to attractive musical acts at the festival.The annual Wichita Black Arts Festival, held in the spring, celebrates the arts, crafts and creativity of Wichita's large African-American community.

A Juneteenth event and parade also are common annual events.\nThe International Student Association at Wichita State University presents an annual international cultural exhibition and food festival, on the campus at WSU, providing an inexpensive sampling of global culture and cuisine to the general public.\nOne or more large Renaissance fairs occur annually, including the \"RenFair\" in conjunction with the \"Kingdom of Calontir\" of the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism). The fairs vary in length from one day to a week, typically at Sedgwick County Park or Newman University.\nThe Wichita Public Library's Academy Awards Shorts program is reportedly the oldest annual, complete, free public screening outside of Hollywood of the full array of short films nominated for an Academy Award (\"Oscar\"). In late winter, shortly before the Academy Awards ceremonies, the films\u2014including all nominated documentary, live action, and animated shorts\u2014are presented, free, at the Library and in local theaters and other venues around Wichita. Wichita's former Congressman, Motion Picture Association President Dan Glickman, has served as Honorary Chair of the event, and some of the filmmakers have attended and visited with the audiences.The Tallgrass Film Festival has been held in downtown Wichita since 2003. It draws over 100 independent feature and short films from all over the world for three days each October. Notable people from the entertainment industry have attended the festival.Aviation-related events are common in the Wichita area, including air shows, fly-ins, air races, aviation conferences, exhibitions, and trade shows. The city's two main air shows, which are generally held in alternating years, are the city-sponsored civilian Wichita Flight Festival (originally the \"Kansas Flight Festival\") and the military-sponsored McConnell Air Force Base Open House and Airshow. Both are large regional air shows with famous acts and multimillion-dollar aircraft displays (including many Wichita-built aircraft). In addition, numerous local, regional, and national aviation organizations host fly-ins, conferences, exhibitions and trade shows in the Wichita area on irregular schedules.\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\n\nMuseums and landmarks devoted to science, culture, and area history are located throughout the city. Several lie along the Arkansas River west of downtown, including the Exploration Place science and discovery center, the Mid-America All-Indian Center, the Old Cowtown living history museum, and The Keeper of the Plains statue and its associated display highlighting the daily lives of Plains Indians.

This arena in the middle of Wichita opened in January 2010.Located immediately east of downtown is Old Town, the city's entertainment district. In the early 1990s, developers transformed it from an old warehouse district into a mixed-zone neighborhood with residential space, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, and museums.Moody's Skidrow Beanery, at 625 E. Douglas in what was to become Old Town, was one of the more famous places in Wichita in the 1960s. It was the scene of a nationally followed First Amendment struggle  and was visited by Allen Ginsberg in 1966 (the name had been changed to the Magic Theatre Vortex Art Gallery) where he first read his long poem \"Wichita Vortex Sutra.\"\nWichita is also home to one major indoor shopping mall: Towne East Square, managed by Simon Property Group. Towne East is home to four anchor stores, and has more than 100 tenants. A second large indoor shopping mall, Towne West Square, has seen all major and many smaller tenants leave and was put into foreclosure in 2019. The oldest mall, Wichita Mall, was for many years largely a dead mall, but has since been converted into office space. There are also two large outdoor shopping centers, Bradley Fair on the city's north-east side and NewMarket Square on the city's north-west side, each with over 50 stores spread out on several acres.\nIn 1936, the Wichita post office contained two oil-on-canvas murals, Kansas Farming, painted by Richard Haines and Pioneer in Kansas by Ward Lockwood. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The post office building became the Federal Courthouse at 401 N. Market Street and the murals are on display in the lobby.Wichita also has a number of parks and recreational areas such as Riverside park, College Hill park, and McAdams Park.\n\n\n=== In popular culture and the arts ===\nWichita is mentioned in the songs \"Wichita Skyline\" by Shawn Colvin, \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, \"I've Been Everywhere\" by Hank Snow, and \"Captain Bobby Stout\" by local musician Jerry Hahn.

In 1944 the city flooded 3 times in 11 days.\nAs a result of the 1944 flood, the idea for the Wichita-Valley Center Floodway (locally known as the \"Big Ditch\") was conceived. The project was completed in 1958. The Big Ditch diverts part of the Arkansas River's flow around west-central Wichita, running roughly parallel to the Interstate 235 bypass. A second flood control canal lies between the lanes of Interstate 135, running south through the central part of the city. Chisholm Creek is diverted into this canal for most of its length.  The city's flood defenses were tested in the Great Flood of 1993. Flooding that year kept the Big Ditch full for more than a month and caused $6 million of damage to the flood control infrastructure. The damage was not fully repaired until 2007. In 2019, the Floodway was renamed the MS Mitch Mitchell Floodway in honor of the man credited for its creation.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nWestar Energy provides electric power.

        "wiki": "Wichita Falls ( WITCH-i-tah) is a city in and the county seat of Wichita County, Texas, United States. It is the principal city of the Wichita Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Archer, Clay, and Wichita counties. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 104,553, making it the 38th-most populous city in Texas. In addition, its central business district is 5 miles (8 km) from Sheppard Air Force Base, which is home to the Air Force's largest technical training wing and the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training  program, the world's only multinationally staffed and managed flying training program chartered to produce combat pilots for both USAF and NATO.\nThe city is home to the Newby-McMahon Building (otherwise known as the \"world's littlest skyscraper\"), constructed downtown in 1919 and featured in Robert Ripley's Ripley's Believe It or Not!.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Choctaw Native Americans settled the area in the early 19th century from their native Mississippi area once Americans negotiated to relocate them after the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. American settlers arrived in the 1860s to form cattle ranches. The city was officially titled Wichita Falls on September 27, 1876. On that day, a sale of town lots was held at what is now the corner of Seventh and Ohio Streets \u2013 the birthplace of the city. The Fort Worth & Denver City Railway arrived in September 1882, the same year the city became the county seat of Wichita County. The city grew westwards from the original FW&DC train depot which was located at the northwest corner of Seventh Street and the FW&DC. This area is now referred to as the Depot Square Historic District, which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark.The early history of Wichita Falls well into the 20th century also rests on the work of two entrepreneurs, Joseph A. Kemp and his brother-in-law, Frank Kell. Kemp and Kell were pioneers in food processing and retailing, flour milling, railroads, cattle, banking, and oil.A flood in 1886 destroyed the original falls on the Wichita River for which the city was named. After nearly 100 years of visitors wanting to visit the nonexistent falls, the city built an artificial waterfall beside the river in Lucy Park. The recreated falls are 54 ft (16 m) high and recirculate at 3,500 gallons per minute. They are visible to south-bound traffic on Interstate 44.\nThe city is currently seeking funding to rebuild and restore the downtown area. Downtown Wichita Falls was the city's main shopping area for many years, but lost ground to the creation of new shopping centers throughout the city beginning with Parker Square in 1953 and other similar developments during the 1960s and 1970s, culminating with the opening of Sikes Senter Mall in 1974.\nWichita Falls was once home to offices of several oil companies and related industries, along with oil refineries operated by the Continental Oil Company (now Conoco Phillips) until 1952 and Panhandle Oil Company American Petrofina) until 1965. Both firms continued to use a portion of their former refineries as gasoline/oil terminal facilities for many years.\n\n\n=== 1964 tornado ===\nA devastating tornado hit the north and northwest portions of Wichita Falls along with Sheppard Air Force Base during the afternoon of April 3, 1964. As the first violent tornado on record to hit the Wichita Falls area, it left seven dead and more than 100 injured. Additionally, the tornado caused roughly $15 million in property damage with about 225 homes destroyed and another 250 damaged. It was rated F5, the highest rating on the Fujita scale, but it is overshadowed by the 1979 tornado.\n\n\n=== 1979 tornado ===\n\nAn F4 tornado struck the heavily populated southern sections of Wichita Falls in the late afternoon on Tuesday, April 10, 1979 (known locally as \"Terrible Tuesday\"). It was part of an outbreak that produced 30 tornadoes around the region. Despite having nearly an hour's advance warning that severe weather was imminent, 42 people were killed (25 in vehicles) and 1,800 were injured because it arrived just in time for many people to be driving home from work. It left 20,000 people homeless and caused $400 million in damage, a U.S. record not topped by an individual tornado until the F5 Moore\u2013Oklahoma City tornado of May 3, 1999.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nWichita Falls is about 15 miles (24 km) south of the border with Oklahoma, 115 mi (185 km) northwest of Fort Worth, and 140 mi (230 km) southwest of Oklahoma City. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 70.71 square miles (183.1 km2), of which 70.69 square miles (183.1 km2) are land and 0.02 square miles (0.052 km2) (0.03%) is covered by water.Wichita Falls experiences a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), featuring long, very hot and humid summers, and cool winters.

Temperatures have hit 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) as early as March 27 and as late as October 17, but more typically reach that level on 28 days annually, with 102 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher annually; the average window for the latter mark is April 9\u2013October 10. However, 59 to 60 nights of freezing lows occur, and an average of 4.8 days where the high does not rise above freezing. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 42.0 \u00b0F (5.6 \u00b0C) in January to 84.4 \u00b0F (29.1 \u00b0C) in July. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u221212 \u00b0F (\u221224 \u00b0C) on January 4, 1947, to 117 \u00b0F (47 \u00b0C) on June 28, 1980. Snowfall is sporadic and averages 4.1 in (10 cm) per season, while rainfall is typically greatest in early summer.\nFrom 2010 through 2013 Wichita Falls, along with a large portion of the south-central US, experienced a persistent drought. In September 2011, Wichita Falls became the first Texas city to have 100 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), or higher, in one year.During the 2015 Texas\u2013Oklahoma floods, Wichita Falls broke its all-time record for the wettest month, with 17.00 inches of rain recorded in May 2015.\n\nNotes: \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000,  104,197 people, 37,970 households, and 24,984 families resided in the city.

The 234-acre (95 ha) Lake Wichita Park is on the north shore of the lake. This park offers a 2.6-mile concrete hiking and bicycling trail that runs from the southern tip of the park at Fairway Avenue to the dam. The trail resumes northward to Lucy Park. The park has a playground, basketball courts, and multiple picnic areas. The 10-unit picnic shelter can seat 60 people and is available for rent. The park also has two lighted baseball and two lighted softball fields, three lighted football fields, and an 18-hole disc golf course. The park has the only model airplane landing strip in the Texas state park system. An off-leash dog park is available.Because of drought, the fish population in Lake Wichita has been damaged by golden algae blooms and periods of low dissolved oxygen. Therefore, the lake was not recommended in 2013 as a destination for fishing. When available, the fish population consists mostly of white bass, hybrid striped bass, channel catfish, and white crappie. Camping facilities are also available.\n\n\n==== Lucy Park ====\nLucy Park is a 170-acre (69 ha) park with a log cabin, duck pond, swimming pool, playground, frisbee golf course, and picnic areas. It has multiple paved walkways suitable for walking, running, biking, or rollerskating, including a river walk that goes to a recreation of the original falls for which the city was named (the original falls were destroyed in a 19th-century flood; the new falls were built in response to numerous tourist requests to visit the \"Wichita Falls\").  It is one of 37 parks throughout the city. The parks range in size from small neighborhood facilities to the 258 acres of Weeks Park featuring the Champions Course at Weeks Park, an 18-hole golf course. In addition, an off-leash dog park is within Lake Wichita Park and a skatepark adjacent to the city's softball complex. Also, unpaved trails for off-road biking and hiking are available.\n\n\n==== Hotter'N Hell Hundred ====\nWichita Falls is the home of the annual Hotter'N Hell Hundred, the largest single day century bicycle ride in the United States and one of the largest races in the world. The race started as a way for the city to celebrate its centennial in 1982. The race takes place over a weekend in August, and there are multiple events for people to participate in.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\nIn 2014, the Wichita Falls Nighthawks, an indoor football team, joined the Indoor Football League but suspended operations after the 2017 season.\nThe city has also been home to a number of semi-professional, developmental, and minor league sports teams, including the Wichita Falls Drillers, a semi-pro football team that has won numerous league titles and a national championship; Wichita Falls Kings (formerly known as Wichita Falls Razorbacks), the professional basketball team Wichita Falls Texans of the Continental Basketball Association; Wichita Falls Fever in the Lone Star Soccer Alliance (1989\u201392); the Wichita Falls Spudders baseball team in the Texas League; the Wichita Falls Wildcats (formerly the Wichita Falls Rustlers) of the North American Hockey League, an American Tier II junior hockey league; and the Wichita Falls Roughnecks (formerly the Graham Roughnecks) of the Texas Collegiate League.  The Dallas Cowboys held training camp in Wichita Falls during the late 1990s. However, the sustainability of minor or rookie league sports franchises in the Wichita Falls region have a questionable future.The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame relocated to Wichita Falls from Amsterdam, New York, in November 2015.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe mayor of Wichita Falls is Stephen Santellana, who was elected in 2016 and re-elected in 2018. The Wichita Falls City Council has six members: District 1-Stephen Santellana, District 2-DeAndra Chenault, District 3-Jeff Browning, District 4-Tim Ingle, District 5-Tom Quintero, and Councilor-at-Large-Michael Smith. The city manager is Darron Leiker.\n\n\n=== State and federal politics ===\nWichita Falls is located in the 69th district of the Texas House of Representatives. Lanham Lyne, a Republican, represented the district from 2011 to 2013; he was the mayor of Wichita Falls from 2005 to 2010. When Lyne declined to seek a second term in 2012, voters chose another Republican, James Frank. Wichita Falls is located in the 30th district of the Texas Senate. Craig Estes, a Republican, had held the senate seat since 2001, until Pat Fallon won election in 2018. Wichita Falls is part of Texas's 13th congressional district for the U.S. House of Representatives. Mac Thornberry, a Republican, has held this seat since 1995. The 13th District is considered the most conservative district in the country, according to the Cook Political Report 2018. Donald Trump won 80% of the vote in the 2016 election.\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice James V. Allred Unit is located in Wichita Falls, 4 mi (6.4 km) northwest of downtown Wichita Falls. The prison is named for former Governor James V. Allred, a Democrat and a native of Bowie, Texas, who lived early in his career in Wichita Falls. The United States Postal Service operates the Wichita Falls Post Office, the Morningside Post Office, the Bridge Creek Post Office, and the Sheppard Air Force Base Post Office.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nWichita Falls is home to Midwestern State University, an accredited four-year college and the only independent liberal arts college in Texas offering both bachelor's and master's degrees. A local branch of nearby Vernon College offers two-year degrees, certificate programs, and workforce development programs, and also Wayland Baptist University, offering both bachelor's and master's degrees, whose main branch is located in Plainview, Texas.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nPublic primary and secondary education is covered by the Wichita Falls Independent School District, and the City View Independent School District. The several parochial schools include Notre Dame Catholic school. Other private schools operate in the city, as does an active home-school community. Many of the local elementary schools participate in the Head Start program for preschool-aged children.\nTwo schools in the Wichita Falls ISD participate in the International Baccalaureate programs. Hirschi High School offers the IB Diploma Programme, and G.H. Kirby Junior High School for the Middle Years Programme. Other public high schools are Wichita Falls High School and S. H. Rider High School (Wichita Falls ISD) and City View High School (City View ISD).\nBy 1879 the first school was established. The first public school was a log cabin structure established in the 1880s; in 1885 it was replaced with a former courthouse. Wichita Falls High School opened in 1890. That year a school district was created, but problems with the law allowing its establishment meant it was dissolved in 1894 and the city provided schooling until the second establishment of a school district in 1900. In 1908 the Texas Legislature issued a charter for WFISD.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nWichita Falls is the western terminus for Interstate 44. U.S. Highways leading to or through Wichita Falls include 287, 277, 281, and 82. State Highway 240 ends at Wichita Falls and State Highway 79 runs through it. Wichita Falls has one of the largest freeway mileages for a city of its size as a result of a 1954 bond issue approved by city and county voters to purchase rights-of-way for several expressway routes through the city and county, the first of which was opened in 1958 as an alignment of U.S. 287 from Eighth Street at Broad and Holliday Streets northwestward across the Wichita River and bisecting Lucy and Scotland Parks to the Old Iowa Park Road, the original U.S. 287 alignment. That was followed by other expressway links including U.S. 82\u2013287 east to Henrietta (completed in 1968), U.S. 281 south toward Jacksboro (completed 1969), U.S. 287 northwest to Iowa Park and Electra (opened 1962), Interstate 44 north to Burkburnett and the Red River (opened 1964), and Interstate 44 from Old Iowa Park Road to U.S. 287/Spur 325 interchange on the city's north side along with Spur 325 from I-44/U.S. 287 to the main gate of Sheppard Air Force Base (both completed as a single project in 1960). However, cross-country traffic for many years had to contend with several ground-level intersections and traffic lights over Holliday and Broad Streets near the downtown area for about 13 blocks between connecting expressway links until a new elevated freeway running overhead was completed in 2001.Efforts to create an additional freeway along the path of Kell Boulevard for U.S. 82\u2013277 began in 1967 with the acquisition of right-of-way that included a former railroad right-of-way and the first project including construction of the present frontage roads completed in 1977, followed by freeway lanes, overpasses, and on/off ramps in 1989 from just east of Brook Avenue west to Kemp Boulevard; similar projects west from Kemp to Barnett Road in 2001 followed by Barnett Road west past FM 369 in 2010 to tie in which a project now underway to transform U.S. 277 into a continuous four-lane expressway between Wichita Falls and Abilene.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nGreyhound Lines provides intercity bus service to other locations served by Greyhound via its new terminal at the Wichita Falls Travel Center located at Fourth and Scott in downtown. Skylark Van Service shuttles passengers to and from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on several runs during the day all week long.The Wichita Falls Municipal Airport is served by American Eagle, with four flights daily to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The Kickapoo Downtown Airport and the Wichita Valley Airport serve smaller, private planes.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nChase Anderson, professional baseball player (born in Wichita Falls and graduated from S.

        "wiki": "Wichita ( WITCH-i-taw) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Sedgwick County. As of 2019, the estimated population of the city was 389,938. Wichita is the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 644,888 in 2018.Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown.\"In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city became an aircraft production hub known as \"The Air Capital of the World.\" Textron Aviation, Learjet, Airbus, and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American aircraft industry. Wichita is also home to McConnell Air Force Base, and Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, the largest airport in Kansas.\nAs an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena and Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center. The city's Old Cowtown Museum maintains historical artifacts and exhibits on the city's early history. Wichita State University is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 B.C. In 1541, a Spanish expedition led by explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the area populated by the Quivira, or Wichita, people. Conflict with the Osage in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to European settlement of the region, the site was in the territory of the Kiowa.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nClaimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it became part of Kansas Territory in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.The Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in Indian Territory by Confederate forces in the American Civil War, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to Texas which became known as the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.In 1868, trader James R. Mead was among a group of investors who established a town company and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and German immigrant William \"Dutch Bill\" Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city's first streets. Wichita formally incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870.\n\nWichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". Across the Arkansas River, the town of Delano became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement. The area had a reputation for violence until local lawmen, Wyatt Earp among them, began to assertively police the cowboys. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to Dodge City. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.Rapid immigration resulted in a speculative land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into Wichita State University, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became Friends University, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after Kansas City and Topeka with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, there were five operating refineries in Wichita with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded Derby Oil, and Fred C. Koch, who established what would become Koch Industries, both began in Wichita during this period.The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited Chicago aircraft builder Emil \"Matty\" Laird to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the Swallow Airplane Company. Two early Swallow employees, Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, Stearman Aircraft in 1926 and Beechcraft in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started his own company in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the \"Air Capital of the World\" in 1929.\n\nOver the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman's Wichita facilities became part of Boeing which would become the city's largest employer. Initial construction of Wichita Municipal Airport finished southeast of the city in 1935. During World War II, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bomber. In 1951, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish McConnell Air Force Base. By 1954, all non-military air traffic had shifted to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport west of the city. In 1962, Lear Jet Corporation opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health care products maker Mentholatum in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping gear retailer Coleman started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of fast food franchises started in Wichita, beginning with White Castle in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including Pizza Hut in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.Wichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous temperance extremist Carrie Nation struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas's prohibition ordinance. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for desegregation. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of George Tiller. Tiller was later killed in Wichita by an extremist in 2009.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nExcept for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to re-develop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. Intrust Bank Arena opened downtown in 2010.Boeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus maintaining facilities in Wichita.Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the Kansas native and U.S. President in 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDowntown Wichita is at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111), at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m). Wichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 54. Part of the Midwestern United States, it is 157 mi (253 km) north of Oklahoma City, 181 mi (291 km) southwest of Kansas City, and 439 mi (707 km) east-southeast of Denver.The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area's topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies Chisholm Creek, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks as well as, further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 163.59 sq mi (423.70 km2), of which 159.29 sq mi (412.56 km2) is land and 4.30 sq mi (11.14 km2) is water.As the core of the Wichita metropolitan area, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, Valley Center, Park City, Kechi, and Bel Aire. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is Eastborough. Adjacent to the city's east side is Andover. McConnell Air Force Base is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, are Derby and Haysville. Goddard and Maize border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWichita lies within the transitional zone of the humid subtropical climate zone and the humid continental climate zone (K\u00f6ppen Cfa/Dfa), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the Great Plains, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer months. These occasionally bring large hail as well as frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history: in September 1965; during the Andover, Kansas Tornado Outbreak of April 1991; and during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s while cold air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0 \u00b0F. Wind speed in the city averages 13 mph (21 km/h). On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and June the wettest.The average temperature in the city is 56.9 \u00b0F (13.8 \u00b0C). Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 32.2 \u00b0F (0.1 \u00b0C) in January to 81.1 \u00b0F (27.3 \u00b0C) in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) an average of 62 days a year and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) on an average 8.5 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was \u221222 \u00b0F (\u221230 \u00b0C) on February 12, 1899. Readings as low as \u221217 \u00b0F (\u221227 \u00b0C) and as high as 111 \u00b0F (44 \u00b0C) occurred as recently as February 10, 2011 and July 29\u201330, 2012, respectively. Wichita receives on average about 32.69 inches (830 mm) of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 88 days of measurable precipitation. The average relative humidity is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages 15.6 inches (40 cm). Measurable snowfall occurs an average of ten days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on five of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 15 days a year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 26 through April 11.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nWichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The downtown area is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the Epic Center. Old Town is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.\nTwo notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the 120-acre (0.49 km2) Riverside Park. upscale College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city.Four other historic neighborhoods\u2014developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near Boeing, Cessna and Beech aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary World War II housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 51st largest city in the United States. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,304.8 per square mile (889.9/km2). There were 167,310 housing units at an average density of 1,022.1 per square mile (475.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% White, 11.5% African American, 4.8% Asian, 1.2% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 15.3% of the population.Of the 151,818 households, 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a male householder with no wife present, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families. 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48, and the average family size was 3.14.The median age in the city was 33.9 years. 26.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.The median income for a household in the city was $44,477, and the median income for a family was $57,088. Males had a median income of $42,783 versus $32,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,517. About 12.1% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nWichita is the principal city of both the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Wichita-Winfield Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, Butler, Harvey, and Sumner counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.The larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes Cowley County and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby Reno County is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIt is the birthplace of famous restaurants such as White Castle and Pizza Hut. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top 25 Kansas-based brands such as Koch, Coleman, Cessna, Pizza Hut, Beechcraft, Freddy's and more are based in Wichita.Wichita's principal industrial sector is manufacturing, which accounted for 21.6 percent of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.Healthcare is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing approximately 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical care tower at Wesley Medical Center. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system's fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children's Hospital, the first and only children's hospital in the Wichita area.Thanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring Butler County, Kansas, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former Derby Oil Company, which was purchased by Coastal Corporation in 1988. Wichita is home to oil & natural gas organizations Kansas Strong and Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association (KIOGA)\nKoch Industries and Cargill, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. Cargill Meat Solutions Div., at one time the nation's 3rd-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer Chance Morgan, gourmet food retailer Dean & Deluca, renewable energy company Alternative Energy Solutions, and Coleman Company, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. Air Midwest, the nation's first officially certificated \"commuter\" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's 8th largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was: 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).The cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0. As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.Wichita has a national reputation in U.S. media as an affordable and pleasant place to live. In July 2006, CNN/Money and Money ranked Wichita ninth on their list of the 10 best U.S. big cities in which to live.  In 2008, MSN Real Estate ranked Wichita 1st on its list of most affordable cities.  Wichita was also named the most \"Uniquely American\" city by Newsmax magazine in a May 2009 piece written by Peter Greenberg.  However, in its 2019 \"Best Places to Live\" survey, U. S. News & World Report, ranked Wichita at #79 out of 125 U.S. cities, and noted that violent crime in Wichita had risen over the previous few years.  In the 2019 KIDS COUNT Data Book, in its annual \"State Rankings on Overall Child Well-Being,\" Kansas was ranked No. 15 out of the 50 states. However, the state has a significantly higher rate of child incarceration than the nation, generally, and a higher rate of the state taking children from their homes.\n\n\n=== Aircraft manufacturing ===\n\nFrom the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, \"Matty\" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, Al Mooney and Bill Lear began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that would lead to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations E. M. Laird Aviation Company (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), Travel Air (started by Beech, Stearman and Cessna), Stearman, Cessna, Beechcraft and Mooney were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932.  By 1931, Boeing (of Seattle, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating \"Boeing-Wichita\", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita having merged into Textron Aviation in 2014, along with Learjet and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and Bombardier (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to depress the aviation sub-sector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., Hawker Beechcraft and Raytheon Aircraft Co.\u2014to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users. In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine light aircraft to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for Spirit Aerosystems to open its plant.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nWichita has a complex cultural mix, dominated by Euro-American, blue-collar industrial and rural tastes, but embracing, to various degrees, classical arts and music, diverse domestic and foreign cultures (Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian, British and Irish cultural influences and activities are conspicuous), and avant garde cultural activity.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nWichita is a cultural center for Kansas, home to several art museums and performing arts groups. The Wichita Art Museum is the largest art museum in the state of Kansas and contains 7,000 works in permanent collections. The Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University is a modern and contemporary art museum with over 6,300 works in its permanent collection.Small art galleries are scattered around the city with some clustered in the districts of Old Town, Delano and south Commerce street. These galleries started the Final Friday Gallery crawl event, where visitors tour attractions free in the evening on the last Friday of each month. Larger museums began participating and staying open late on Final Fridays shortly after its beginning.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nWichita is the music hub of central Kansas, and draws major acts from around the world, performing at various concert halls, arenas and stadiums around the area. Most major rock'n'roll and pop-music stars, and virtually all country music stars, perform there during their career.\nMusic Theatre Wichita, Wichita Grand Opera (both nationally renowned), and the Wichita Symphony Orchestra perform regularly at the Century II Convention Hall downtown. Concerts are also regularly performed by the nationally noted schools of music at Wichita's two largest universities.The Orpheum Theatre, a classic movie palace built in 1922, serves as a downtown venue for smaller shows.\nWichita is alleged to be the birthplace of the electric guitar, the fuzz box, and other key innovations in rock'n'roll music.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThe Wichita River Festival has been held in the Downtown and Old Town areas of the city since 1972. It has featured events, musical entertainment, sporting events, traveling exhibits, cultural and historical activities, plays, interactive children's events, a flea market, river events, a parade, block parties, a food court, fireworks, and souvenirs for the roughly 370,000+ patrons who attend each year.  In 2011, the festival was moved from May to June because of rain during previous festivals. The Wichita River Festival has seen immense growth, with record numbers in 2016 and again in 2018. Much of that growth is attributed to attractive musical acts at the festival.The annual Wichita Black Arts Festival, held in the spring, celebrates the arts, crafts and creativity of Wichita's large African-American community. It usually takes place in Central-Northeast Wichita. A Juneteenth event and parade also are common annual events.\nThe International Student Association at Wichita State University presents an annual international cultural exhibition and food festival, on the campus at WSU, providing an inexpensive sampling of global culture and cuisine to the general public.\nOne or more large Renaissance fairs occur annually, including the \"RenFair\" in conjunction with the \"Kingdom of Calontir\" of the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism). The fairs vary in length from one day to a week, typically at Sedgwick County Park or Newman University.\nThe Wichita Public Library's Academy Awards Shorts program is reportedly the oldest annual, complete, free public screening outside of Hollywood of the full array of short films nominated for an Academy Award (\"Oscar\"). In late winter, shortly before the Academy Awards ceremonies, the films\u2014including all nominated documentary, live action, and animated shorts\u2014are presented, free, at the Library and in local theaters and other venues around Wichita. Wichita's former Congressman, Motion Picture Association President Dan Glickman, has served as Honorary Chair of the event, and some of the filmmakers have attended and visited with the audiences.The Tallgrass Film Festival has been held in downtown Wichita since 2003. It draws over 100 independent feature and short films from all over the world for three days each October. Notable people from the entertainment industry have attended the festival.Aviation-related events are common in the Wichita area, including air shows, fly-ins, air races, aviation conferences, exhibitions, and trade shows. The city's two main air shows, which are generally held in alternating years, are the city-sponsored civilian Wichita Flight Festival (originally the \"Kansas Flight Festival\") and the military-sponsored McConnell Air Force Base Open House and Airshow. Both are large regional air shows with famous acts and multimillion-dollar aircraft displays (including many Wichita-built aircraft). In addition, numerous local, regional, and national aviation organizations host fly-ins, conferences, exhibitions and trade shows in the Wichita area on irregular schedules.\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\n\nMuseums and landmarks devoted to science, culture, and area history are located throughout the city. Several lie along the Arkansas River west of downtown, including the Exploration Place science and discovery center, the Mid-America All-Indian Center, the Old Cowtown living history museum, and The Keeper of the Plains statue and its associated display highlighting the daily lives of Plains Indians. The Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum in downtown Wichita occupies the original Wichita city hall, built in 1892. The museum contains artifacts that tell the story of Wichita and Sedgwick County starting from 1865 and continuing to the present day. Nearby is the 1913 Sedgwick County Memorial Hall and Soldiers and Sailors Monument. East of downtown are the Museum of World Treasures and railroad-oriented Great Plains Transportation Museum. The Coleman Factory Outlet and Museum was at 235 N St. Francis street and was the home of the Coleman Lantern until it closed in 2018. Wichita State University hosts the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology. The Kansas Aviation Museum, housed in the Terminal and Administration building of the former Municipal Airport, is in southeast Wichita adjacent to McConnell Air Force Base.\n\nBotanica, The Wichita Gardens, also along the Arkansas River, has 24 themed gardens including the Butterfly Garden and the award-winning Sally Stone Sensory Garden. The Sedgwick County Zoo in the northwest part of Wichita is the most popular outdoor tourist attraction in the state of Kansas, and is home to more than 2,500 animals representing 500 different species.  The zoo is next to Sedgwick county park and Sedgwick County Extension Arboretum.\nIntrust Bank Arena is the city's primary event venue, featuring 22 suites, 2 party suites, 40 loge boxes and over 300 premium seats with a total potential capacity of over 15,000. This arena in the middle of Wichita opened in January 2010.Located immediately east of downtown is Old Town, the city's entertainment district. In the early 1990s, developers transformed it from an old warehouse district into a mixed-zone neighborhood with residential space, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, and museums.Moody's Skidrow Beanery, at 625 E. Douglas in what was to become Old Town, was one of the more famous places in Wichita in the 1960s. It was the scene of a nationally followed First Amendment struggle  and was visited by Allen Ginsberg in 1966 (the name had been changed to the Magic Theatre Vortex Art Gallery) where he first read his long poem \"Wichita Vortex Sutra.\"\nWichita is also home to one major indoor shopping mall: Towne East Square, managed by Simon Property Group. Towne East is home to four anchor stores, and has more than 100 tenants. A second large indoor shopping mall, Towne West Square, has seen all major and many smaller tenants leave and was put into foreclosure in 2019. The oldest mall, Wichita Mall, was for many years largely a dead mall, but has since been converted into office space. There are also two large outdoor shopping centers, Bradley Fair on the city's north-east side and NewMarket Square on the city's north-west side, each with over 50 stores spread out on several acres.\nIn 1936, the Wichita post office contained two oil-on-canvas murals, Kansas Farming, painted by Richard Haines and Pioneer in Kansas by Ward Lockwood. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The post office building became the Federal Courthouse at 401 N. Market Street and the murals are on display in the lobby.Wichita also has a number of parks and recreational areas such as Riverside park, College Hill park, and McAdams Park.\n\n\n=== In popular culture and the arts ===\nWichita is mentioned in the songs \"Wichita Skyline\" by Shawn Colvin, \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, \"I've Been Everywhere\" by Hank Snow, and \"Captain Bobby Stout\" by local musician Jerry Hahn.

The city is also the setting of the long-running comic strip Dennis the Menace. The city in post-apocalyptic form is also the setting of majority of the book trilogy, The Testing by Joelle Charbonneau.\nAMD planned to release a new processor, code named Wichita, in 2012, but the project was cancelled in favor of a newer design.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nWichita is home to several professional, semi-professional, non-professional, and collegiate sports teams. Professional teams include the Wichita Thunder ice hockey team and Wichita Force indoor football team.

In 1944 the city flooded 3 times in 11 days.\nAs a result of the 1944 flood, the idea for the Wichita-Valley Center Floodway (locally known as the \"Big Ditch\") was conceived.

A second flood control canal lies between the lanes of Interstate 135, running south through the central part of the city. Chisholm Creek is diverted into this canal for most of its length.  The city's flood defenses were tested in the Great Flood of 1993. Flooding that year kept the Big Ditch full for more than a month and caused $6 million of damage to the flood control infrastructure. The damage was not fully repaired until 2007. In 2019, the Floodway was renamed the MS Mitch Mitchell Floodway in honor of the man credited for its creation.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nWestar Energy provides electric power.

          "My sister and I did this tour on a Saturday morning. We were pleasantly surprised by the number of people from other states who came on this tour. Very informative!!",
          "Really good decision to visit this example of Frank Lloyd Wright's house. Even the furniture was designed by Wright. Located in a nice section of town. Advanced ticket required. Small group tours.",
          "If you are into this type of thing then you will love this. Can not believe that of all places in this county, Wichita has one. It is like you stepped back in time when you visit.",
          "We are somewhat interested in architecture so we went on the 1 hour tour because we thought the longer tours would be too long. The house is incredible and our tour was very insteresting. We are thinking of returning for an evening tour.",
          "It took me three tries before I could get a tour of this place. They always had a reason I had to come back another day. Turns out I could have avoided it, the tour guides weren't the most knowledgable.",
          "We love the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and were excited to see another of his works. Tours depart at different times so call or check the website. The house has been restored beautifully and with great care. You go into a good majority of the house. The tour lasted",
          "One of the finest examples of the architecture of the most famous artist in American history. This house and gardens is one of the best examples of the mature work of Wright. While much of his work was in transition in the mid-west this is one of his last and most refined",
          "Went here recently and found the home to be well preserved and interesting. Worth an hour of your time if you are into FLW or architecture. From the outside I didn't think it looked impressive - more like a comercial building, but inside was nice and well preserved.",
          "The guy was a genius. Docents were very knowledgeable. The living room is impressive. I highly recommend the two hour tour.",
          "Wight's last Prairie-style home and probably the biggest. Very thorough tour of both levels and the gardens. Go on a sunny day to experience the use of stained glass and skylights. Well worth a detour.",
          "This Frank Lloyd Wright house has only been open to the public three years. The house, originally owned by a Kansas Governor, has been painstakingly brought back to life. It\u2019s amazing! Book a tour, the docents are knowledgeable and their insights enhance the experience. Enjoy!",
          "We had a two-hour tour of the house and loved it. The docents were incredibly knowledgeable and the house is beautiful! If you're anywhere near Wichita and particularly if you live in Kansas, this is a must-see!",
          "I\u2019ve been on a number of tours of Wright designed buildings and this is one of the best. The home and it restoration is impressive. The docents are well trained. During the tour you spend enough time in each area of the home to really get a feel for the design. Bravo to Mr.",
          "Very interesting tour of a Frank Lloyd Wright house. The person giving the tour was very knowledgeable. The house has a lot of the original furniture and is well restored. Make sure you make a reservation, even in the off season because they seem to only give a couple of tours a",
          "Wichita knows what a gem they have. Set in a beautiful neighborhood, this FLW home is meticulous. The tour guides we had (3 to start, then our group was split in to 2 groups and we had one guide each) were excellent. They had a thorough understanding of the home, Frank Lloyd",
          "I have ran the local 1/2 Marathon many times and it goes right by the Allen House. My brother was here from out of town and we went on the tour of the building. It was beautiful. If you love the clean lines of Wright's design you will not be disappointed in the tour of the",
          "This really is a hidden gem! Many Wichitans don't even realize they have a Frank Lloyd Wright house in their city because it goes by the local name of The Allen House. This house, in the beautiful neighborhood of College Hill, is one of Wrights last \"Prarie Homes\", built around",
          "This 2-story prairie home is stunning. Ive been to several other Wright homes ( and museums), and this is my favorite. The tour guide was wonderful, knew so much, and was open to questions and comments from the group. The home is in a lovely residential part of Wichita,",

          "They were so accommodating, we arrived after 10 am thinking you could go inside anytime 10-11:30. Not so. The guided tour begins at 10, but they let us join the group. The tour was fantastic. I grew up in Wichita and never knew this was here.",
          "This is my first tour of a Frank Lloyd Wright house. Other tours we had seen were quite pricey. This one was only $15 ($12 age 55+). Our docents were excellent! They knew so much info it made the tour even that much better. And of course, the house was amazing. Would",
          "We booked our tour online and then just used our name to check in. The main tour guide seemed to be a bit hesitant in her presentation however the second guide was very good. The house is outstanding and once again Frank Lloyd Wright was ahead of his time! If it weren't so hot",
          "We loved the Frank Lloyd Wright Allen House! We have been to two homes in Buffalo, NY (where we are from), two homes in Pittsburgh, PA and now this home in Wichita. My husband and I, and our two sons in their early 20's loved this home. The tour was fantastic, the home is in",

          "I took a group of 8 women here and we all thoroughly enjoyed our tours guides. I believe one may have been in training, but she always had something to add, as well. They have now gotten the grounds/gardens done and they are beautiful! There was an additional bedroom open,",

          "Fascinated by the architecture of FLW, we decided to drop in and see the Allen house while in Wichita,KS. Definitely worth seeing if one would have been been able to take a tour to see the inside as well. Check the schedule online to see when the tours are available. My wife",

          "And this is #1 by a wide margin. I have toured dozens of FLW houses and been to Taliesin and Taliesin West. The Allen house is a spectacular example of the prairie style. The docents are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. If possible, treat yourself and go for an evening tour",
          "This was our 6th tour of and FLW property and possibly our favorite. We had a really excellent tour with a a delightful guide. Our hostess and the place itself were 5 star. I gave this only 4, however, due to really poor responsiveness on behalf of the office staff prior to",
          "Due to our time limits, we could only drive by the exterior. It sits in a very nice neighborhood of wonderful older houses. If in Wichita again, I will try to get on one of the few available tours. Thankfully the website has a great collection of interior and exterior photos.",
          "I was in Wichita visiting family and found this house by accident. Such a wonderful surprise. It has much of the original furniture including clothing and books. It was a good tour. Knowledgeable docent, answered questions and was very thorough. All in all a great place to",
          "This is worth your time to see this treasure here in Wichita. It's given me an itch to go see other Wright homes. I went with my mom, daughter, and a student from Malaysia. It was funny that my mom and I felt just a real peace in the home with all the lines that are carried",
          "We had so wanted to take a tour, but the site was closed. We had a hard time figuring out when they were even open. More Saturday hours would have been great, as we have seen many of Frank's work around the country and was hoping to add another to our list.... Maybe next time.",
          "This is a must see whether or not you are a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright. Frank was a brilliant architect and visionary. It's amazing to believe that this was built in 1918! This is the only FLLW home in Kansas, so whether you are a local or visiting (as I was to drop off my WSU",

          "Well maintained example of Wright's prairie style. Furniture and details served to confirm my admiration of his. Staff friendly",
          "From their web site they promise tours are available daily, which is the only way to see the interior. When we called they didn't have a tour the next day, and on days when they did have a tour, there was only one per day at 10:00AM. They were booked up for all the days we had",
          "We loved our tour of this amazing Frank Lloyd Wright site, a late prairie style (designed in 1915). Our docent, Bonnie, was well informed and did a great job explaining the history of the house and its owners, as well as some of its unique features. It's worth a visit to Wichita",

          "This house is amazing! It's definitely one of the state's hidden treasures. Unfortunately, our docent was enamored with the sound of his own voice, and we were regaled with this non-stop arcane minutiae about Wright's life, Kansas politics, and Wichita history. We had to rush",
          "A truly beautiful home I only had a few minutes to check it out but I'm so glad I did. Like many of his homes the art is better than the engineering. But it's a beautiful home.",
          "Do you know of Frank Lloyd Wright? This was one of his houses designed around the turn of the 20th century. We took a tour and was amazed with the wood and windows. If you get a chance to tour the house DO IT.",

          "I had the recent pleasure of revisiting this house as an adult. As a child, my Grandmother was friends with the owner and I was able to see the house in it's glory days. What I remember most was the koi pond and lavish interiors offset by the simple lines of FLW's prairie style",
          "Stunning house, late prairie school and well worth a visit though off the beaten path. Tours by appointment and limited but so well worth taking the time. Your eye hardly knows where to look next, especially in the living room that is floor to ceiling amazing design & colors.",

        "wiki": "Dan White (March 25, 1908 \u2013 July 7, 1980) was an American actor, well known for appearing in Western films and TV shows.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nDan White was born to George and Orpha White in Falmouth, Florida, one of thirteen siblings. The Whites moved to Lakeland during World War I. By age 14, White was in show business. He left home to travel thousands of miles throughout the South in tent, minstrel, vaudeville and theater shows. His brother Willard joined him for nine years in a show in Tampa's Rialto Theatre. Frances Langford worked with White during the time, and he convinced her to go to Hollywood. During this period, he met Tilda Spivey and proposed marriage on February 25, 1933. She had a 2-year-old child, Arthur Gifford, from a previous marriage. Dan left show business for financial reasons to work with the Civilian Conservation Corps. He still longed for a career in entertainment and took a cruise to Los Angeles. He and his family made extra stops at cities all over the country to earn money to continue the tour.\nIn January 1937, he stopped at Texarkana, Arkansas, where Tilda awaited the birth of their child. Her sister, Mary, who was in Texarkana, invited the Whites to stay there for a few months. The baby, June Larue White, was finally born, and the Whites continued toward California.\n\n\n=== In Hollywood ===\nThey arrived 16 days later and rented a house for 23 years, even film scripts were written in their own living room. Dan had a hard time finding a job and was in Costa Rica working on the Pan American Highway. Although, upon return in 1938, he got work with the Republic Pictures Corporation, making 6 films in his first year. The first film was, Prairie Moon, with Gene Autry. White made $55 a week during that picture. He'd claimed to have made about 300 films and 150 television cameos during his years in Hollywood. Around 70 percent were Westerns. Among some of his well-known films were, The Yearling, Distant Drums, Red River, To Kill a Mockingbird, Giant, Duel in the Sun, Four Faces West, Jailhouse Rock and Touch of Evil. During this time, White and his wife had a third child, Donald Curtis White, born on November 9, 1941. The films that made White most famous were his numerous appearances in B-Westerns, where he portrayed the antagonist. During the 1950s and 1960s, he started turning to television. He was offered the role of, \"Sam the Bartender,\" in, Gunsmoke, but he didn't commit to the idea. He asked his best friend Glenn Strange to apply for the job.\n\n\n=== Post-acting ===\nDan loved California for the almost 40 years he was there, but his true love was his old town in Florida. Upon retirement, he returned to Tampa and made appearances in Western Film Round-Ups and talk shows. He was often visited by his family until his death on July 7, 1980, in Tampa, Florida.\nDan was honored with a star on the Newhall Walk of Western Stars on April 11, 2019\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nNote: An asterisk (*) means that Dan White had an uncredited role; two asterisks means that he was credited as either Daniel White or Daniel M. White.\n\n\n== Television ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDan White on IMDb\nhttp://www.b-westerns.com/villan33.htm at The Old Corral http://www.b-westerns.com/\nhttps://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/tv1903.htm\nhttps://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2102.htm",

        "wiki": "Downtown Wichita is the central business district of Wichita, Kansas, United States. The political and financial hub of the city, it is home to several of the area's major landmarks and event venues including the Epic Center, Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center, Intrust Bank Arena, and the Old Town entertainment district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1872, the community of Wichita opened a toll bridge on Douglas Avenue to Delano across the Arkansas River, and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway opened a line through the city, triggering an economic boom. Local industries in banking, meat packing, and real estate emerged. A large warehouse district developed along the rail lines south from Central Avenue. By the late 1870s, the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Main Street had become the downtown hub of local commerce.Continued economic growth through the 1880s spurred further downtown development, including the completion of the Wichita City Building in 1892.  The building housed all city government offices, both the police and fire departments, and the city's first public library. During the subsequent decades, a number of manufacturers constructed plants downtown, including the Coleman Company in 1901.The Forum, Wichita's convention center and primary event venue, opened downtown in 1911. It was built on the site of city co-founder Dutch Bill Greiffenstein's homestead. The Orpheum Theatre opened downtown in 1922 and became a popular venue on the vaudeville circuit.By the 1960s, sections of downtown had entered a period of decline. To commemorate the centennial of Wichita's founding, the city razed The Forum and in its place built the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center which opened in 1969. The city government relocated to a new City Hall in 1975. In 1981, the former City Building reopened as the Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum. In 1987, construction finished downtown on the Epic Center office tower, the tallest building in the city and in the state of Kansas.In 1989, the city initiated a redevelopment plan to revitalize Downtown Wichita. Among the plan's results was the redevelopment of the old warehouse district into Old Town, an entertainment district home to numerous restaurants and night clubs. The city implemented further development plans, including the construction of Intrust Bank Arena, a new multi-purpose indoor arena which opened in 2010.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDowntown Wichita is located at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111) at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m).

          "This place was very calm when i was there. It was a quick look. Wichita is the beggest city in the state of Kansas. So it has a lot of thaetres, bars, cafes, clubs, musiums, parks. If you have time you will find what to do here to you taste. Besides it's not an expensive one.",
          "Great times with great friends. Went to several bars and the cigar bar! The whole area was rocking and lots of people having a good time. We did see several law enforcement officers, not bothering anyone just there if need! I liked that fact, one even helped with directions! Fun",

          "I mostly just like to check out the bands in the open air places. My most favorite is the Pumphouse, an old gas station converted into a bar. I've listened to some good bands there, some not so good, but it's outside so I don't feel closed in. The Brickyard is another & Mort's",

          "If you like college (yuppie/vegan/snotty) kids food and music you'll feel right at home at most places. I'm an old hippie myself. I don't quite fit in with the \"I'm better than you crowd\".",
          "Most of the area swarms with newly associated with alcoholic beverages, so it's generally pretty chaotic. The brick paved streets get blocked off after 11:00 PM from cars, so everyone can stumble around like idiots and not have to worry about getting run over. Police presence",

          "I was really disappointed! Old Town Wichita is full of empty buildings with a few bars, restaurants, and a handful of stores. From a distance it looks great but when one gets out to explore there is not much there! It more like Rundown Wichita!",
          "Old town is only a couple of blocks so it's really quaint. Not a whole lot in general but lots of nice restaurants ands bars are opening in the area, some with nice outdoor seating. Real urban feel. Streets are cobblestone giving a European feel",

          "Visited when not a lot of people around. The Staff were very friendly and helpful. They took time to explain about the buildings and items inside. It certainly helps to give an insight as to what the early days of Wichita was like. This place is definitely recommended.",
          "We decided to go out for lunch and were looking for something with an outdoor dining area because it was such a nice February day! We parked and walked around and came across Heroes. It has a nice outdoor area and a big garage door that opens to let the outside in. We ordered",
          "They have done a lot to make this a great area to visit. Good choice in places to eat and the food at the movie theater is very good I must add. They got movie theater menu top notch I was very impressed with each visit of the quality. Lot of money spent and something to do for",
          "I was very unhappy that this place was advertised as for families when in fact it was not. It was also advertised with shopping which there was not. If you are into drinking and bar hopping then this is your place.",

          "We traveled here mainly to see the Museum of World Treasures, but then we decided it had so many interesting shops and restaurants to see that we looked around for a little while. We did not get to see a lot but what we did see made us want to go back and see more the next",

          "Old Town offers a lot of variety for all ages, from museum, to movie theater, to restaurants and bars. I prefer this area during the daytime or early evening - after dark be careful and aware as you would in any area.",
          "They have a cool muesem with a 4000 year old mummy that is freaky lol but there is a lot of clubs around",
          "There are a few good bars here that are hopping on weekends, like Hero's and if you are here in town for a few nights it's not too bad, but really slide on down a few streets to The Anchor instead of eating around here, then come back to Old Town to party. This area is not",

          "This is a pretty eclectic area, but we really like the Warren Theater, especially on the $5 Wednesdays. It's kind of nice, being empty nesters, to go to a show and not have kids screaming and talking during the movie. Convenient parking in the garage, pretty decent food and",
          "Lots of bars and dives. In the summer there are lots of places with live music and other venues. The streets are paved with brick, really nostalgic look and feel. Great place to take out of town visitors. Also a club scene so if ya feel like cutting up a rug. Plenty of places to",
          "When we go to Old town it's usually to dance in front of the Warren in the square and once in front of the arts and farmers market. Afterward we grab a bite to eat at any of the various places around there.",
          "There seems to actually be a New Town and an Old Town separated by an arch and a roadway. New Town was a little more inhabited; clean and pretty. There are restaurants, a couple of shops, a movie theatre, and a big square in the middle of it all with benches, grass, and some",
          "Nice area to walk around. Reminded us of the Old Market area in Omaha, NE, although much smaller. More places to eat than shop. Wish we would have had time to take in the museum. Allow 1-2 hours to walk through, if shopping heavily, eating, or doing the museum allow more.",
          "Cute area. The area is small. There are a number of places to eat and drink. There is a free public parking lot. And there appeared to be a lot of open parking on the street around 6 pm on a Saturday and around 7 pm on a Friday.",

          "We took the free trolley from the Visitor Center at 515 S. Main Street. It takes you on a loop including going through Old Town. We found out that we will want to go back and walk around, as time didn't allow us to spend enough time. On Douglas Street there are amazing",

          "There are a few good restaurants/bars in this area, Hero's, Emerson Biggins, but not much else. This really had the potential to be a nice addition to the Wichita community. The police have taken over and it is not worth going to anymore.",

          "There were a few nice shops and we found a very good place to eat. A couple were closed (noon on a Tuesday)? It was a good place to stop and get out of the car for awhile while passing through. For me, it would not be a destination location, but nice if you are in the area.",

          "Not used to what the US names Old town I was first disappointed upon reaching the place. Then I found it much more animated and rich in stores, pubs and boutiques than your usual all american shopping mall. Maybe not old but charming in a way that it does make a difference.",
          "Many good restaurants and live music venues, a natural history museum, nice hotels plus a great theater where dinner and drinks are served while you watch your digital movie. Blues parties, car shows, people watching. Generally well policed, leave 12 to 1:00am is best to avoid",

          "We had a fairly unmemorable lunch in Old Town. The area was experiencing some major criminal activity while we were there and that made us feel a little uncomfortable about exploring Old Town. So we ate and drove around the area. It's okay but nothing too exciting.",

          "Several great restaurants depending upon the type of food that you want.In my opinion the Lark Spur is best for a nice dinner. Hero's sports bar for burgers,nachos, etc River City Brewery for a great home brew with some fish and chips. In the summer Old Town has free live music",

          "A nice relaxing area to stroll when in Wichita. In years past they had underground shops but we were advised they closed. Being underground in those old factories was very unique; too bad they couldn't make it. The area itself is made up of some great little shops and",

          "It's not New Orleans' French Quarter or Austin's 6th Street, but it's cute and has personality and the occasional event or live music on the square. Fun to putter around and visit some of the small shops near the theater or walk along the river.",
          "Developed over the last 20 years, Old Town now sports loft apartments, hotels, restaurants, bars, a Museum of World Treasures and a few shops to meet anyone's expectations. Primarily an entertainment district with a growing resident population.",

          "If you quaint, cobbled areas full of galleries, eateries, and shops, you'll enjoy Old Town in Wichita. It reminded me of Old Montreal, Pearl Street in Boulder, Church Street in Burlington, VT... a pretty, cobble-stoned area great for ducking into little locally owned shops and",

        "wiki": "Riverside is a neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas, United States. A mostly residential area located between the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, it is home to several of the city's museums and large parks.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRiverside was founded in March 1886 when the Riverside Land Company, led by developer James Oakley Davidson, had the area surveyed and platted. The company intended for the new neighborhood to be Wichita's most stylish residential area and supported the construction of bridges and a trolley line to connect it to downtown.  The local real estate market collapsed the next year, however, and development stalled for a decade. By 1889, several of the company's investors, including Davidson and Burton Campbell, had built large, luxurious homes for themselves. Campbell's mansion, modeled after a Scottish castle, became known as Campbell Castle or Crumb Castle locally and was eventually designated a historical landmark.In 1897, the Wichita city government purchased land in the neighborhood and began developing parks. It also built two more bridges, increasing access to the area and attracting more home buyers. Riverside became a popular recreational area for local residents, and development continued over the ensuing decades. The Riverside Boathouse opened on the Little Arkansas River in the late 1890s followed by a zoo in Central Riverside Park in 1921 and a public swimming pool in South Riverside Park in 1923. The Wichita Art Museum opened in 1935. In 1938, the Works Progress Administration replaced the pool with a second pool called Municipal Beach.Beginning in the 1960s, further development changed Riverside dramatically as new sites opened and others closed. The Boathouse was demolished in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal program. Similarly, the zoo was closed and torn down in 1973 with the opening of the Sedgwick County Zoo in the western part of the city. In the 1970s, the city funded the construction a new facility for the Art Museum. To commemorate the United States Bicentennial, the city had The Keeper of the Plains, a 44-foot steel sculpture by artist Blackbear Bosin, erected at the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers in 1974. The Mid-America All-Indian Center opened in 1976. That same year, the public Ralph Wurz Tennis Center opened on the former site of Municipal Beach. In 1987, the city opened Botanica, The Wichita Gardens in Riverside.Today, Riverside is regarded as a historic neighborhood known for its architecture and as a cultural and recreational center in Wichita. It has also become a popular residential area for college students and young professionals.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRiverside is located at 37\u00b041\u203255\u2033N 97\u00b021\u203235\u2033W (37.698611, -97.359722) at an elevation of 1,306 feet (398 m). The Arkansas River forms its western and southern border, 13th Street North its northern border, and Bitting Street, the Little Arkansas River, and Nims Street its eastern border. The confluence of the two rivers forms the neighborhood's southeastern corner. Located immediately northwest of Downtown Wichita, Riverside borders Midtown to the east and North Riverside to the north. Delano lies across the Arkansas River to the south; Indian Hills lies across the river to the west.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFor the purposes of representation on the Wichita City Council, Riverside lies within Council District 6.For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, Riverside is located in the 25th and 29th districts of the Kansas Senate and the 92nd district of the Kansas House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWichita Public Schools operates one facility in the neighborhood:  Riverside Leadership Magnet Elementary School.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nThe Wichita Department of Park and Recreation maintains five parks in Riverside:  Oak Park, Sim Park, Central Riverside Park, North Riverside Park, and South Riverside Park. Situated on West 11th Street, Oak Park occupies 37.5 acres (15.2 ha) on the east bank of the Little Arkansas River and includes a frisbee disc golf course, nature trails, and a natural habitat area. 181.48-acre (73.44 ha) Sim Park lies on the east bank of the Arkansas River and is divided into several areas:  the Arthur B. Sim Municipal Golf Course, a large picnic area, a natural habitat area, Botanica, and the Old Cowtown Museum.  The park also includes a fitness trail with exercise stations.The three Riverside Parks form the heart of the city park system.  The largest, Central Riverside Park, spans 58 acres (23 ha) on the west bank of the Little Arkansas River and hosts an open air bandstand, playground, and interactive water fountain as well as outdoor art sculptures and historic structures. It is also home to the city's Spanish-American Memorial and a small zoo, the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit. North Riverside Park covers 30 acres (12 ha) on the river's east bank immediately southeast of Oak Park.  It is the site of several historical structures including Park Villa, a stone and tile-roofed meetinghouse used for community gatherings. The 30-acre (12 ha) South Riverside Park sits on West Central Avenue in a horseshoe bend of the Little Arkansas's course and is home to the Ralph Wurz Riverside Tennis Center.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nBotanica, The Wichita Gardens\nThe Keeper of the Plains\nMid-America All-Indian Center\nOld Cowtown Museum\nWichita Art Museum\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nNims is the main north-south street through Riverside. North of River Boulevard, its name changes to Bitting Street. River Boulevard follows a winding course along the west bank of the Little Arkansas River. South of Murdock Street, its name changes to Stackman Drive. Other arterial roads include 13th Street, which runs east-west along the northern edge of the neighborhood, and Seneca, a north-south street which enters Riverside from the south and turns east to become Central Avenue.Wichita Transit offers bus service to Riverside on its 17 route.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "great stop to see some animals and a quick little added bonus when traveling with kids. THe animals were cute",
          "Didn't realize this exhibit is right in the park for viewing free of charge. I love being in nature.",
          "Did a quick walk thru and saw maybe a dozen animals, mostly birds. They looked pretty sad. The few homeless people hanging out nearby are enough to make this exhibit uncomfortable.",
          "This is free and open to the public, so it's nice to swing by when you're in the area. Some of the animals were uncooperative, so we missed out on them. The others were hard to photograph because of the screens (there for everyone's protection).",
          "The small building is sometimes overshadowed by the playground and water fountain (shoots in the air) that is in the same park. The smaller cages and the close proximity to them allow you to see the animals closer than in a typical zoo setting. Too, there is not a lot of places",
          "When we were there we watched the beaver try to chew his way out of his enclosure for a long time. I think he's the one that did escape so with all the wire that's been put up, he should be enclosed good and well!",
          "Those poor animals kept in cages so tiny ... I went there with a friend of mine during the summer to take my daughter and her step son to play in the fountain. We were there about 3 hours and never saw a keeper anywhere. The bathrooms next to the exhibit were so bad you had to",
          "This is a small exhibit at Riverside Park which is nice if you are already visiting the park. But it is not worth driving here just for this. This exhibits shows some of Kansas wildlife. There are a few animals in cages with signs, it's free, and maintained behind the scenes.",

          "This poor little exhibit is situated inside Riverside Park. If that's all the wildlife that Kansas has, then I'm sad for them. There was a turkey vulture, an owl, a falcon, a duck and a few other little birds I don't know the names of, and one lonely bobcat. There were",

          "Not much to see and it took us nearly an hour to find a way into the park as every entrance and street was barricaded when we were there. If you're spending time in the park it's worth a few minutes stop, otherwise not worth going out of your way",

          "Very impressive and perfect for the kids! My sister and I were passing through with our five kids (ages 1-10) on the way to Texas and wanted to let the kids stretch their legs. They had a blast and it wore them out for a quiet drive.",
          "We happened upon the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit while taking in the wonderful park that it sets in. It was a great surprise. The animals were very calm as were the rest of the visitors. It was a nicely kept area and a great surprise. There is a pond on the side of the exhibit.",
          "My boyfriend and I are here quiet often. We have never seen any kind of violence towards any of the animals. We were there around noon a few weekends back and the feeding people brought out the screech owl so we could pet him and hes was soooo soft. We both like it there and",
          "This is a small exhibit, but it concentrates on local wildlife. Nice to get up close to the critters you might see in the area. Obviously not meant to be a zoo, but still a good place ti bring the kids.",

        "wiki": "Riverside is a neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas, United States. A mostly residential area located between the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, it is home to several of the city's museums and large parks.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRiverside was founded in March 1886 when the Riverside Land Company, led by developer James Oakley Davidson, had the area surveyed and platted. The company intended for the new neighborhood to be Wichita's most stylish residential area and supported the construction of bridges and a trolley line to connect it to downtown.  The local real estate market collapsed the next year, however, and development stalled for a decade. By 1889, several of the company's investors, including Davidson and Burton Campbell, had built large, luxurious homes for themselves. Campbell's mansion, modeled after a Scottish castle, became known as Campbell Castle or Crumb Castle locally and was eventually designated a historical landmark.In 1897, the Wichita city government purchased land in the neighborhood and began developing parks. It also built two more bridges, increasing access to the area and attracting more home buyers. Riverside became a popular recreational area for local residents, and development continued over the ensuing decades. The Riverside Boathouse opened on the Little Arkansas River in the late 1890s followed by a zoo in Central Riverside Park in 1921 and a public swimming pool in South Riverside Park in 1923. The Wichita Art Museum opened in 1935. In 1938, the Works Progress Administration replaced the pool with a second pool called Municipal Beach.Beginning in the 1960s, further development changed Riverside dramatically as new sites opened and others closed. The Boathouse was demolished in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal program. Similarly, the zoo was closed and torn down in 1973 with the opening of the Sedgwick County Zoo in the western part of the city. In the 1970s, the city funded the construction a new facility for the Art Museum. To commemorate the United States Bicentennial, the city had The Keeper of the Plains, a 44-foot steel sculpture by artist Blackbear Bosin, erected at the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers in 1974. The Mid-America All-Indian Center opened in 1976. That same year, the public Ralph Wurz Tennis Center opened on the former site of Municipal Beach. In 1987, the city opened Botanica, The Wichita Gardens in Riverside.Today, Riverside is regarded as a historic neighborhood known for its architecture and as a cultural and recreational center in Wichita. It has also become a popular residential area for college students and young professionals.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRiverside is located at 37\u00b041\u203255\u2033N 97\u00b021\u203235\u2033W (37.698611, -97.359722) at an elevation of 1,306 feet (398 m). The Arkansas River forms its western and southern border, 13th Street North its northern border, and Bitting Street, the Little Arkansas River, and Nims Street its eastern border. The confluence of the two rivers forms the neighborhood's southeastern corner. Located immediately northwest of Downtown Wichita, Riverside borders Midtown to the east and North Riverside to the north. Delano lies across the Arkansas River to the south; Indian Hills lies across the river to the west.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFor the purposes of representation on the Wichita City Council, Riverside lies within Council District 6.For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, Riverside is located in the 25th and 29th districts of the Kansas Senate and the 92nd district of the Kansas House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWichita Public Schools operates one facility in the neighborhood:  Riverside Leadership Magnet Elementary School.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nThe Wichita Department of Park and Recreation maintains five parks in Riverside:  Oak Park, Sim Park, Central Riverside Park, North Riverside Park, and South Riverside Park. Situated on West 11th Street, Oak Park occupies 37.5 acres (15.2 ha) on the east bank of the Little Arkansas River and includes a frisbee disc golf course, nature trails, and a natural habitat area. 181.48-acre (73.44 ha) Sim Park lies on the east bank of the Arkansas River and is divided into several areas:  the Arthur B. Sim Municipal Golf Course, a large picnic area, a natural habitat area, Botanica, and the Old Cowtown Museum.  The park also includes a fitness trail with exercise stations.The three Riverside Parks form the heart of the city park system.  The largest, Central Riverside Park, spans 58 acres (23 ha) on the west bank of the Little Arkansas River and hosts an open air bandstand, playground, and interactive water fountain as well as outdoor art sculptures and historic structures. It is also home to the city's Spanish-American Memorial and a small zoo, the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit. North Riverside Park covers 30 acres (12 ha) on the river's east bank immediately southeast of Oak Park.  It is the site of several historical structures including Park Villa, a stone and tile-roofed meetinghouse used for community gatherings. The 30-acre (12 ha) South Riverside Park sits on West Central Avenue in a horseshoe bend of the Little Arkansas's course and is home to the Ralph Wurz Riverside Tennis Center.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nBotanica, The Wichita Gardens\nThe Keeper of the Plains\nMid-America All-Indian Center\nOld Cowtown Museum\nWichita Art Museum\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nNims is the main north-south street through Riverside. North of River Boulevard, its name changes to Bitting Street. River Boulevard follows a winding course along the west bank of the Little Arkansas River. South of Murdock Street, its name changes to Stackman Drive. Other arterial roads include 13th Street, which runs east-west along the northern edge of the neighborhood, and Seneca, a north-south street which enters Riverside from the south and turns east to become Central Avenue.Wichita Transit offers bus service to Riverside on its 17 route.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The 1979 Easter Sunday Herman Hill riot in Wichita, Kansas \u2013 a confrontation between 500 law-enforcement personnel (from Wichita and surrounding jurisdictions) and the 3,500 attendees at a rock concert in Herman Hill Park \u2013 was one of the largest riots in the history of Wichita, drawing national attention and creating political and legal controversy.The event resulted in over 50 injuries, to more than two-dozen police officers and dozens of civilians, and over 80 arrests. Tear gas was used and firearms were discharged. The event triggered extensive local, state and national attention, including investigations by authorities at all those levels, and raised major questions about the conduct of law enforcement in the Wichita area.\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe Herman Hill riot was a riot that took place in Wichita, Kansas, between the audience at a local rock concert in Herman Hill Park and the police on April 15, 1979 (Easter Sunday). Reports stated that 53 people were injured during the riot.\nThe concert began in an undeveloped park on the southern edge of the city purportedly capable of holding 1,500 people; later crowd estimates ranged between 3,500 and 5,000 people, but attendees estimated the number to be closer to 1,000.\nPolice responded to complaints about loud noise and drug use. As news of the concert spread, motorcycles, along with some cars and pick-up trucks, began illegally parking on a section of grass that had previously been used as an overflow parking area. The conflict began when police ordered people to remove these vehicles from the grass. Tensions escalated after officers who responded to the complaints saw an individual dispensing beer from the back of a pick-up truck. A combination of the people's refusal to disperse, the confrontation with the owner of the pick-up, and the fact that the officers were greatly outnumbered caused the officers to call for reinforcements. The second wave of police launched tear gas canisters into the crowd. Many children were present and were overcome with the gas. In retaliation, some in the crowd began throwing rocks and bottles. A police car was overturned. In panic, many of the concert-goers fled into the surrounding residential area and were sheltered for several hours by local residents.\nAs a result of the riot, 62 adults and 22 juveniles were taken into custody. Reports stated that 22 citizens and 31 police officers were injured during the riot. Many local law enforcement agencies attended, including the Kansas Highway Patrol, Sheriff's Offices and Police Departments of nearby towns (including Arkansas City, Colwich, Goddard, Derby and Haysville). Representatives of a total of 22 different law enforcement groups were present on the scene. Reports cited damage of around $10,000. At least two citizens were shot at.There was public outcry against the police's handling of the riot. There were no lasting injuries among officers, and police were not found to have broken any laws. In an interview, the city's police chief denied that brutality was used in quelling the riot. After the statement, a video tape was shown in which police hit civilians with batons.\nIn the years following the riot incident, Herman Hill Park has evolved into a neighborhood-centered and family-friendly destination. The City of Wichita established a police substation in the northeast corner of the park. In 2003, the Water Center, a groundwater remediation facility and interactive museum, opened to the public. Paved trails allow visitors to walk alongside a creek, view an aquarium of native fish, and watch the Arkansas River as it flows out of the city.\nThis event inspired a song by Manilla Road, \"Herman Hill\", released in 1979.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nWilliamson, Roger (2000).

        "wiki": "Downtown Wichita is the central business district of Wichita, Kansas, United States. The political and financial hub of the city, it is home to several of the area's major landmarks and event venues including the Epic Center, Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center, Intrust Bank Arena, and the Old Town entertainment district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1872, the community of Wichita opened a toll bridge on Douglas Avenue to Delano across the Arkansas River, and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway opened a line through the city, triggering an economic boom. Local industries in banking, meat packing, and real estate emerged. A large warehouse district developed along the rail lines south from Central Avenue. By the late 1870s, the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Main Street had become the downtown hub of local commerce.Continued economic growth through the 1880s spurred further downtown development, including the completion of the Wichita City Building in 1892.  The building housed all city government offices, both the police and fire departments, and the city's first public library. During the subsequent decades, a number of manufacturers constructed plants downtown, including the Coleman Company in 1901.The Forum, Wichita's convention center and primary event venue, opened downtown in 1911. It was built on the site of city co-founder Dutch Bill Greiffenstein's homestead. The Orpheum Theatre opened downtown in 1922 and became a popular venue on the vaudeville circuit.By the 1960s, sections of downtown had entered a period of decline. To commemorate the centennial of Wichita's founding, the city razed The Forum and in its place built the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center which opened in 1969. The city government relocated to a new City Hall in 1975. In 1981, the former City Building reopened as the Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum. In 1987, construction finished downtown on the Epic Center office tower, the tallest building in the city and in the state of Kansas.In 1989, the city initiated a redevelopment plan to revitalize Downtown Wichita. Among the plan's results was the redevelopment of the old warehouse district into Old Town, an entertainment district home to numerous restaurants and night clubs. The city implemented further development plans, including the construction of Intrust Bank Arena, a new multi-purpose indoor arena which opened in 2010.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDowntown Wichita is located at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111) at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m). It mainly consists of the area between Murdock Street to the north, U.S. Route 54 to the south, the Arkansas River to the west, and Washington Street to the east. Portions of Downtown overlap with the Midtown neighborhood to the north, Delano across the river to the west, and Riverside to the northwest. In addition, it borders the McAdams neighborhood to the northeast, The Hyde (also called Kellogg School) to the east, and South Central to the south.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAs of 2018, several national and regional companies maintain offices in Downtown Wichita.  The headquarters of agricultural conglomerate Cargill\u2019s Protein Group is located there as are the central offices of IT company High Touch Technologies, shipping firm King of Freight, and area commercial banks Emprise Bank, Fidelity Bank, and Intrust Bank. Other firms with offices downtown include telecommunications conglomerate AT&T, life insurance company New York Life, engineering consultancy PEC, home security firm Protection One, and regional electric utility Westar Energy.Once the largest bank in Kansas, Bank IV was headquartered in downtown Wichita from its foundation in 1887 to its acquisition in 1995 by Boatman's Bank. Outdoor equipment maker Coleman, founded in Wichita in 1901, operated a factory downtown from 1929 to 1990 and then a factory outlet store and museum until 2018.Several national hotel chains have locations downtown. The Hyatt Regency Wichita and the historic Broadview Hotel, operated by Drury Hotels, are near the Century II Convention Center.  Other hotels include the Ambassador Hotel, Hotel at Old Town, and Hotel at WaterWalk as well as a Courtyard by Marriott, Fairfield Inn by Marriott, and Wyndham Garden Motel.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe portion of Downtown north of Douglas Avenue and west of Washington Street is in City Council District 6. The rest of Downtown is in City Council District 1. Wichita City Hall is located downtown at the corner of Main Street and Central Avenue.Downtown Wichita is in the 29th district of the Kansas Senate and the 103rd district of the Kansas House of Representatives.The Wichita U.S. Courthouse, one of the three courthouses of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, is located downtown at the corner of 3rd Street and North Market Street.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe offices of The Wichita Eagle, the primary newspaper published in the city, and the Wichita Business Journal are located downtown in Old Town. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita publishes its official newspaper, Catholic Advance, from its offices in downtown Wichita.KMUW, the NPR member station in Wichita, broadcasts from studios in Old Town.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nThe city government's Park and Recreation Department manages several parks and recreational spaces downtown.  A. Price Woodard Park occupies 4.21 acres (1.70 ha) on the east bank of the Arkansas River immediately south of Douglas Avenue. Named after a former mayor of the city, it includes an amphitheater, a lighted decorative fountain, and a number of bronze sculptures. Chester I. Lewis Reflection Square Park is a small, 0.3-acre (0.12 ha) \"pocket park\" on Douglas Avenue with water fountains and bronze sculptures. Named after a local civil rights leader, the park is located on the site where the Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in 1958. Finlay Ross Park is a 0.5-acre (0.20 ha) mini-park east of Century II consisting of landscaped, multi-level pools, fountains, and waterfalls.The 0.45-acre (0.18 ha) Heritage Square Park, located on East William Street, includes a gazebo and rock fountain pool. The Mayor's Pine Grove is a 0.77-acre (0.31 ha) space at Water Street and 2nd Street developed in 1978 to help beautify the area. Naftzger Memorial Park covers 0.88 acres (0.36 ha) on East Douglas Avenue and includes a gazebo, decorative waterfall, and a fountain dedicated to temperance radical Carrie Nation. Veterans Memorial Park occupies 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) on Greenway Boulevard and hosts 16 memorials to U.S. military veterans and their families. Designed by California Skateparks, the Wichita Skatepark is a 0.25-acre (0.10 ha), all-concrete skateboarding park on South St. Francis Street beneath the U.S. Route 54 overpass.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nCentury II Performing Arts & Convention Center\nCommerce Street Art District\nDouglas Design District\nEpic Center\nGreat Plains Transportation Museum\nIntrust Bank Arena\nKansas Sports Hall of Fame\nMuseum of World Treasures\nOld Town\nOrpheum Theatre\nWichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nBroadway Street is the main north-south street through downtown; Douglas Avenue is the main east-west street.

The base point for the numbering of all postal addresses in the city and Sedgwick County is the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Main Street.  Douglas is the divider between north and south; Main Street is the divider between east and west.The Wichita Transit Center, Wichita Transit\u2019s main bus terminal, is located downtown at South Topeka Street and East William Street.

The Graduate School offers 44 master's degrees in more than 100 areas and a specialist in education degree.\nWichita State University also hosts classes at four satellite locations: WSU West in Maize, WSU South in Derby, and the WSU Downtown Center that houses the university's Center for Community Support & Research and the Department of Physical Therapy. A quarter-mile northeast of campus, the Advanced Education in General Dentistry building, built in 2011, houses classrooms and a dental clinic. It is adjacent to the university's 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) Eugene M. Hughes Metropolitan Complex, where many of WSU noncredit courses are taught.\n\n\n== History ==\nWichita State University began in 1886 as a private Congregational preparatory school, founded by Rev. Joseph Homer Parker. Initially it was referred to as \"Young Ladies College\", \"Wichita Ladies College\", and \"Congregational Female College\". It was founded during a boom in college and university creation and it was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older who were \"able to read, write, spell and recite the parts of speech.\" In early 1887, the project's leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and in response, renamed their school Fairmount College.  Envisioned to be the \"Vassar of the West,\" the streets of the neighboring neighborhoods were named after prominent women's colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. Support came mainly from the Plymouth Congregational Church to build it, but the school never opened its doors. In 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school Fairmount Institute. It opened in September to men and women, with an emphasis on training in preaching or teaching. It closed because of financial difficulties.\nIn 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. Amid growing financial troubles, the college's supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the Municipal University of Wichita (popularly known as \"Wichita University\" or \"WU\"). It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi, and catered to students of limited means. On July 1, 1964, the school officially entered the state system of higher education as Wichita State University (WSU).WSU is one of three research institutions in the state of Kansas, along with Kansas State University (KSU) and the University of Kansas (KU).\n\n\n== Campuses ==\nThe Main Campus is located at 1845 North Fairmount in northeast Wichita, is mostly bounded between the streets of 17th St N, 21st St N, Hillside St, Oliver Ave.\nThe campus includes the Edwin A.

Frank Barton School of BusinessWichita State University was ranked the 52nd top college in the United States in 2014 by the Social Mobility Index college rankings. Wichita State is placed among National Universities in the United States in rankings done by U.S. News & World Report. For all engineering research and development expenditures, WSU ranked No. 63 in the US for year 2013, with $47 million The National Science Foundation ranked Wichita State University No. 4 among all U.S. universities in money spent on aerospace research and development in fiscal year 2013, with $39 million in expenditures and No. 1 in industry-funded aerospace R&D. Wichita State's W. Frank Barton School of Business was listed in The Princeton Review 2011 \"301 Best Business Schools,\" ranked as the 11th best program in the country for students seeking an undergraduate degree in entrepreneurship for 2007.The Aerospace Engineering department was founded in 1928 and has longstanding collaborative relationships with Airbus North America, Boeing, Bombardier-Learjet, Cessna, Hawker Beechcraft, Spirit AeroSystems, and other Wichita aviation concerns. The department teaches in the areas of composites, structures, Engineering mechanics, computational Fluid dynamics, applied Aerodynamics, and Flight simulation. Students can readily do internships at the nearby airports and many airplane company like Cessna, Learjet, etc.\nThe Wichita State University Libraries have holdings of more than 2 million volumes, over 200 electronic databases and more than 70,000 journal subscriptions. The University Libraries consist of the main Ablah Library, the McKinley Chemistry Library, the Thurlow Lieurance Music Library and University Libraries Special Collections. The libraries are open to community users and serve as a regional United States Federal Government Documents Depository, a State of Kansas Government Documents Depository, and is the State of Kansas' only Patents and Trademarks Library. WSU Special Collections and University Archives contains numerous rare books, incunabula, historical manuscripts collections, maps and photographic archives documenting Kansas history, as well as hosting the Wichita Photo Archives.In 2014, President John Bardo announced plans to launch a major academic and student life initiative, dubbed the \"Innovation University.\" The plan kicked off with the completion of renovations to the university's student union, the Rhatigan Student Center, and the opening of Shocker Hall, a new 318,000-square-foot, 784-bed housing facility on the main campus. It includes public/private partnerships with domestic and international companies that would build offices on the WSU main campus and collaborate with the students and faculty on research projects and product development through a technology transfer system. The university has secured partnerships with three companies: Wichita-based ABI Group of Companies; Sunnyvale, Calif.-based NetApp; and the Indian IT firm Tech Mahindra. The plan calls for the addition of more than 20 new buildings, including a prospective new building for the Frank W. Barton School of Business, a new residence hall, commercial offices, \"creative collision\" facilities, two mixed-use developments and a hotel. Ground will break on the first building, the Technology Transfer/Experiential Learning Building, in Q1 2015. The development will occur on the site of the WSU-owned Braeburn Golf Course adjacent to campus, which closed in November.President John Bardo's executive team passed a tobacco-free campus policy in August 2016. In 2017, the university, all of its satellite campuses and all WSU-owned properties became tobacco free.  The ban applies to all tobacco products including smokeless tobacco, oral tobacco and electronic cigarettes.  It does not apply to products that deliver nicotine for the purpose of cessation, or to tobacco used in controlled research or for educational, clinical or religious ceremonial purposes.  Smoking was still allowed in designated areas outside of WSU-ICAA controlled athletic facilities and within designated areas of the WSU Innovation Campus.\n\n\n=== Tuition ===\nTuition for full-time, Kansas residents attending Wichita State for the 2016-2017 academic year is $7,528. While fees for out-of-state residents for the 2016-2017 academic year are $15,851, tuition at Wichita State for Kansas residents placed it as the exemplary public university, slightly beneath the weighted average tuition among Kansas's six public four-year universities.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Greek organizations ===\nRecognized fraternities and sororities at the university include:\n\n\n== Athletics ==\n\nWSU is an NCAA Division I institution competing in the American Athletic Conference and fields teams in tennis, cross-country, basketball, track, golf, men's baseball and women's volleyball and softball. Also, it offers club sports such as crew, bowling, shooting sports, and other intramural sports.\nThe men's baseball team is college baseball's highest winning team for the past 31 years, with numerous conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances. The baseball team won the national championship in 1989 and was runner-up in 1982, 1991 and 1993. They play at Eck Stadium.\nThe men's basketball team has played in the NCAA tournament 10 times since 1954, advancing to the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, the Elite Eight in 1981, and the Sweet Sixteen in 2006 and 2015, and also entering the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The team also won the 2011 National Invitation Tournament Championship, beating the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Shockers have two alumni currently playing in the NBA in Ron Baker and Fred VanVleet, guards during the 2013 Final Four run, unbeaten 2013\u201314 regular season, and 2015 Sweet Sixteen run. Other Wichita State products who have played in the league include All-Star Xavier McDaniel, power forwards Antoine Carr, Cliff Levingston and Cleanthony Early, two-time All-American Dave Stallworth, center Gene Wiley, guards Gal Mekel and Toure' Murry, and Greg Dreiling. Four-time All-American Cleo Littleton joined the Shocks in 1951, breaking the unofficial color barrier in the Missouri Valley Conference.\nThe men's and women's bowling teams have won numerous USBC Intercollegiate Team Championships, including the men's 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2010 title and the women's 2005, 2007 and 2009 title.\nShocker Track and Field History: Seven Olympians. Two National Champions. 60 NCAA All-Americans. Under Steve Rainbolt (2001\u20132012): 14 Missouri Valley Conference Championship Teams. 29 NCAA All-Americans.\nMen's Cross Country: Established in 1947. Eight Missouri Valley Conference titles, five consecutive (1971\u201375). Five NCAA All-Americans. Nine Missouri Valley Conference Champions. 46 All-MVC award winners.\nWomen's Cross Country: Established in 1983. 10 Missouri Valley Conference titles, six consecutive (2005\u201310). Four NCAA All-Americans. Six Missouri Valley Conference Champions. 56 All-MVC award winners.\nThe school discontinued its football program following the 1986 season due to poor attendance, financial red ink, NCAA recruiting violations, and the state of disrepair of Cessna Stadium. It had been never fully recovered from losing 16 starters, its athletic director, football coach and many others critical to the WSU program in a plane crash in 1970 (see below). Legendary NFL coach Bill Parcells was a linebacker at WSU in 1962 and 1963 before serving as a graduate assistant in 1964. Wichita State University was also the first Division I-A school to hire a black head coach in College Football, Willie Jeffries in 1979.\n\n\n=== Shockers ===\nThe name for WSU's athletic teams is the Shockers and, collectively, students are also referred to as being \"Shockers.\" The name reflects the University's heritage: Early students earned money by shocking, or harvesting, wheat in nearby fields. Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers. Although the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol. WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school. Elsea, who had been a Marine during World War II, decided that \"the school needed a mascot who gave a tough impression, with a serious, no-nonsense scowl.\"\nOnce Elsea's mascot was adopted by the university, which by that time was known as the Municipal University of Wichita, all that was needed was a name. The October 7, 1948, issue of The Sunflower, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. It was freshman Jack Kersting who suggested the winning name, \"WuShock.\"\nIn 1998, WuShock, also referred to as \"Wu,\" marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help. Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.\n\n\n=== Football team plane crash ===\n\nOn October 2, 1970, a plane carrying players and staff of the WSU football team took off from a Colorado airport after refueling and was bound for Logan, Utah for a game against Utah State University. It flew into a mountain valley too narrow to enable it to turn back and smashed into a mountainside, killing 31 of the 40 players, administrators, and fans near a ski resort 40 miles (64 km) away from Denver. It was the first, or \"gold\" plane, the twin to a second black plane. President Richard Nixon sent the president of the university a note which read, \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to you in this time of sorrow.\"\n\n\n== Notable alumni and faculty ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nMiner, Craig.

        "wiki": "Osage Hills State Park is a 1,100-acre (4.5 km2) Oklahoma state park It is located in eastern Osage County, Oklahoma. The nearest cities are Pawhuska and Bartlesville. The park offers outdoor recreation opportunities including camping, hiking, fishing and wildlife watching. Park facilities include picnic tables and shelters, 20 semi-modern RV campsites, 16 tent sites and 8 cabins. Several of the park's structures are historic parkitecture built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n== History ==\nOsage Hills State Park is one of the seven original parks constructed for the State of Oklahoma by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Construction began in 1935. The CCC workers were housed at the north end of the park. The remnants of the housing area still visible include concrete and rock foundations, an amphitheater and a lone chimney. The workers built structures using stone and timber that were obtained locally. Their design was based on \u201cnaturalistic architecture,\u201d similar to that used in other parks built by the U. S. Government during the 1930s and 40s. Eight guest cabins are still used today. Although their appearance is the same as when they were built, they have all been modernized with energy-saving appliances and air conditioning.The park also has a large picnic shelter that is suitable for use by large groups. It has a kitchen, a large dining area, and two stone fireplaces on opposite sides of the building.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\nAbundant fishing for bass, crappie, catfish, and perch can be found in Lookout Lake, or in Sand Creek at the south end of the park.  Miles of hiking trails cross the park offering opportunities for beginning hikers or more challenging paths.  Wildlife is abundant in the park and includes whitetail deer, wild turkey, bobcat, raccoon, and more.Other facilities include hiking trails and a swimming pool. There are also tent campgrounds and recreational vehicle (RV) parking areas.\n\n\n== Fees ==\nTo help fund a backlog of deferred maintenance and park improvements, the state implemented an entrance fee for this park and 21 others effective June 15, 2020.  The fees, charged per vehicle, start at $10 per day for a single-day or $8 for residents with an Oklahoma license plate or Oklahoma tribal plate.  Fees are waived for honorably discharged veterans and Oklahoma residents age 62 & older and their spouses.  Passes good for three days or a week are also available; annual passes good at all 22 state parks charging fees are offered at a cost of $75 for out-of-state visitors or $60 for Oklahoma residents.

        "wiki": "Wichita ( WITCH-i-taw) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Sedgwick County. As of 2019, the estimated population of the city was 389,938. Wichita is the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 644,888 in 2018.Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown.\"In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city became an aircraft production hub known as \"The Air Capital of the World.\" Textron Aviation, Learjet, Airbus, and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American aircraft industry. Wichita is also home to McConnell Air Force Base, and Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, the largest airport in Kansas.\nAs an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena and Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center. The city's Old Cowtown Museum maintains historical artifacts and exhibits on the city's early history. Wichita State University is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 B.C. In 1541, a Spanish expedition led by explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the area populated by the Quivira, or Wichita, people. Conflict with the Osage in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to European settlement of the region, the site was in the territory of the Kiowa.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nClaimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it became part of Kansas Territory in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.The Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in Indian Territory by Confederate forces in the American Civil War, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to Texas which became known as the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.In 1868, trader James R. Mead was among a group of investors who established a town company and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and German immigrant William \"Dutch Bill\" Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city's first streets. Wichita formally incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870.\n\nWichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". Across the Arkansas River, the town of Delano became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement. The area had a reputation for violence until local lawmen, Wyatt Earp among them, began to assertively police the cowboys. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to Dodge City. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.Rapid immigration resulted in a speculative land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into Wichita State University, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became Friends University, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after Kansas City and Topeka with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, there were five operating refineries in Wichita with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded Derby Oil, and Fred C. Koch, who established what would become Koch Industries, both began in Wichita during this period.The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited Chicago aircraft builder Emil \"Matty\" Laird to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the Swallow Airplane Company. Two early Swallow employees, Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, Stearman Aircraft in 1926 and Beechcraft in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started his own company in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the \"Air Capital of the World\" in 1929.\n\nOver the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman's Wichita facilities became part of Boeing which would become the city's largest employer. Initial construction of Wichita Municipal Airport finished southeast of the city in 1935. During World War II, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bomber. In 1951, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish McConnell Air Force Base. By 1954, all non-military air traffic had shifted to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport west of the city. In 1962, Lear Jet Corporation opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health care products maker Mentholatum in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping gear retailer Coleman started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of fast food franchises started in Wichita, beginning with White Castle in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including Pizza Hut in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.Wichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous temperance extremist Carrie Nation struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas's prohibition ordinance. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for desegregation. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of George Tiller. Tiller was later killed in Wichita by an extremist in 2009.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nExcept for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to re-develop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. Intrust Bank Arena opened downtown in 2010.Boeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus maintaining facilities in Wichita.Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the Kansas native and U.S. President in 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDowntown Wichita is at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111), at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m). Wichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 54. Part of the Midwestern United States, it is 157 mi (253 km) north of Oklahoma City, 181 mi (291 km) southwest of Kansas City, and 439 mi (707 km) east-southeast of Denver.The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area's topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies Chisholm Creek, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks as well as, further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 163.59 sq mi (423.70 km2), of which 159.29 sq mi (412.56 km2) is land and 4.30 sq mi (11.14 km2) is water.As the core of the Wichita metropolitan area, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, Valley Center, Park City, Kechi, and Bel Aire. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is Eastborough. Adjacent to the city's east side is Andover. McConnell Air Force Base is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, are Derby and Haysville. Goddard and Maize border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWichita lies within the transitional zone of the humid subtropical climate zone and the humid continental climate zone (K\u00f6ppen Cfa/Dfa), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the Great Plains, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer months. These occasionally bring large hail as well as frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history: in September 1965; during the Andover, Kansas Tornado Outbreak of April 1991; and during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s while cold air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0 \u00b0F. Wind speed in the city averages 13 mph (21 km/h). On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and June the wettest.The average temperature in the city is 56.9 \u00b0F (13.8 \u00b0C). Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 32.2 \u00b0F (0.1 \u00b0C) in January to 81.1 \u00b0F (27.3 \u00b0C) in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) an average of 62 days a year and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) on an average 8.5 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was \u221222 \u00b0F (\u221230 \u00b0C) on February 12, 1899. Readings as low as \u221217 \u00b0F (\u221227 \u00b0C) and as high as 111 \u00b0F (44 \u00b0C) occurred as recently as February 10, 2011 and July 29\u201330, 2012, respectively. Wichita receives on average about 32.69 inches (830 mm) of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 88 days of measurable precipitation. The average relative humidity is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages 15.6 inches (40 cm). Measurable snowfall occurs an average of ten days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on five of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 15 days a year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 26 through April 11.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nWichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The downtown area is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the Epic Center. Old Town is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.\nTwo notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the 120-acre (0.49 km2) Riverside Park. upscale College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city.Four other historic neighborhoods\u2014developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near Boeing, Cessna and Beech aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary World War II housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 51st largest city in the United States. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,304.8 per square mile (889.9/km2). There were 167,310 housing units at an average density of 1,022.1 per square mile (475.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% White, 11.5% African American, 4.8% Asian, 1.2% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 15.3% of the population.Of the 151,818 households, 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a male householder with no wife present, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families. 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48, and the average family size was 3.14.The median age in the city was 33.9 years. 26.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.The median income for a household in the city was $44,477, and the median income for a family was $57,088. Males had a median income of $42,783 versus $32,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,517. About 12.1% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nWichita is the principal city of both the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Wichita-Winfield Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, Butler, Harvey, and Sumner counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.The larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes Cowley County and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby Reno County is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIt is the birthplace of famous restaurants such as White Castle and Pizza Hut. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top 25 Kansas-based brands such as Koch, Coleman, Cessna, Pizza Hut, Beechcraft, Freddy's and more are based in Wichita.Wichita's principal industrial sector is manufacturing, which accounted for 21.6 percent of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.Healthcare is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing approximately 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical care tower at Wesley Medical Center. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system's fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children's Hospital, the first and only children's hospital in the Wichita area.Thanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring Butler County, Kansas, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former Derby Oil Company, which was purchased by Coastal Corporation in 1988. Wichita is home to oil & natural gas organizations Kansas Strong and Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association (KIOGA)\nKoch Industries and Cargill, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. Cargill Meat Solutions Div., at one time the nation's 3rd-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer Chance Morgan, gourmet food retailer Dean & Deluca, renewable energy company Alternative Energy Solutions, and Coleman Company, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. Air Midwest, the nation's first officially certificated \"commuter\" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's 8th largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was: 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).The cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0. As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.Wichita has a national reputation in U.S. media as an affordable and pleasant place to live. In July 2006, CNN/Money and Money ranked Wichita ninth on their list of the 10 best U.S. big cities in which to live.  In 2008, MSN Real Estate ranked Wichita 1st on its list of most affordable cities.  Wichita was also named the most \"Uniquely American\" city by Newsmax magazine in a May 2009 piece written by Peter Greenberg.  However, in its 2019 \"Best Places to Live\" survey, U. S. News & World Report, ranked Wichita at #79 out of 125 U.S. cities, and noted that violent crime in Wichita had risen over the previous few years.  In the 2019 KIDS COUNT Data Book, in its annual \"State Rankings on Overall Child Well-Being,\" Kansas was ranked No. 15 out of the 50 states. However, the state has a significantly higher rate of child incarceration than the nation, generally, and a higher rate of the state taking children from their homes.\n\n\n=== Aircraft manufacturing ===\n\nFrom the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, \"Matty\" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, Al Mooney and Bill Lear began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that would lead to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations E. M. Laird Aviation Company (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), Travel Air (started by Beech, Stearman and Cessna), Stearman, Cessna, Beechcraft and Mooney were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932.  By 1931, Boeing (of Seattle, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating \"Boeing-Wichita\", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita having merged into Textron Aviation in 2014, along with Learjet and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and Bombardier (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to depress the aviation sub-sector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., Hawker Beechcraft and Raytheon Aircraft Co.\u2014to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users. In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine light aircraft to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for Spirit Aerosystems to open its plant.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nWichita has a complex cultural mix, dominated by Euro-American, blue-collar industrial and rural tastes, but embracing, to various degrees, classical arts and music, diverse domestic and foreign cultures (Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian, British and Irish cultural influences and activities are conspicuous), and avant garde cultural activity.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nWichita is a cultural center for Kansas, home to several art museums and performing arts groups.

You would never have thought twice to pay attention to it if you didn\u2019t know what it was. Looks like the university janitor\u2019s",
          "Walking up to this building it doesn't look like much. The door was unlocked and the lights have motion sensors. The museum is small, but lots of history. Definitely worth the stop. It's free to look around.",
          "It's a good place to visit, situated beside the Marcus welcome center of Wichita State University. It demonstrates on how the pizza hut's first pizza was made. Takes about 5-10 minutes to visit the place.",

          "Granted, it is amazing to think the mega pizza chain started in this tiny building on WSU Campus, but other than that, it's just an itsy brick building. If there wasn't a sign declaring the home of Pizza Hut, you would never give it a second glance.",
          "What a great little museum to find on our trip to Wichita, KS...the museum isn\u2019t open very long during the day but it was cool to see for sure!",
          "So I saw the Original Pizza Hut on a map while looking to see how to get from the airport to the hotel. It sits on the Wichita State campus so it's easy to find. Neat little visit on the way to the hotel. Unfortunately, I could not get inside due to renovations. I did peak in",

          "The Carneys had a vision, perhaps they were not even aware of. I just retired last year from the company that has made all Pizza Hut pans since Pizza Hut's inception. Yes, that company is in Kansas. The original restaurant store is just something to see when you realize that",

          "Really just a tiny building that is sort of hard to find, but the story behind it is neat and motivational. My son is a die hard Pizza Hut fan and we thought it was pretty cool to see where it all started. I read the actually building was somewhere else and moved to this",

          "I mean, it is what it is. The hallowed grounds of the original Pizza Hut. As far as I'm aware, you can't go inside it (I was on campus frequently and never saw any public access). It's a cool place to show friends and family who love Pizza Hut, but there's not much you can do",

          "A walk down memory lane to visit the original Pizza Hut on the Wichita State University Campus. We lived in Wichita when Pizza Hut started and the memories came flooding back when we saw the building again. Not spectacular, but memorable for those of us growing up with a soon to",

          "Located on Wichita U campus was easy to find. A small brick house that started a franchise. We visited on a Sunday.",
          "It's a neat piece of American food history, but it's not really much to see. The small building is not open and it was moved to this spot. Worth a quick stop if you are on the Wichita State campus, but otherwise a photo from the web would give you the same effect.",

          "We almost skipped this stop in our trip due to spending more time than allotted at other activities. I am glad we made time. It was a neat little attraction. And fun to take a picture n front of the Original Pizza Hut.",
          "There really isn't a lot to do in Wichita on a Sunday morning, so we went out in search of the first Pizza Hut. It's not in operation anymore. In fact the building has been moved from it's original location to the Wichita campus. But it was a fun adventure to pass some time.",
          "It didn't have an actual address so we luckily found it. If you are in town and bored, it will entertain you for 3 mins. I mean we all have eaten Pizza Hut, so to see how it came to be was a little interesting.",
          "I grew up near the original College Hill location. Kellogg and Bluff intersection, Dog and Shake, Pizza Hut and a Vickers station across the Road. I believe it was in the early 70's when the Scotch and Sirloin moved to the property? The Old Pizza Hut housed several businesses,",

From the original schedule to some of the pop culture icons that were making the Pizza Hut commercials you remember as a kid.  Neat place.

        "wiki": "Dennis Lynn Rader (born March 9, 1945) is an American serial killer known as BTK or the BTK Strangler (an acronym he gave himself, for \"bind, torture, kill\"). Between 1974 and 1991, Rader killed ten people in Wichita and Park City, Kansas, and sent taunting letters to police and newspapers describing the details of his crimes. After a decade-long hiatus, Rader resumed sending letters in 2004, leading to his 2005 arrest and subsequent guilty plea. He is serving ten consecutive life sentences at El Dorado Correctional Facility in  Prospect Township, Butler County, Kansas.\n\n\n== Life and background ==\nDennis Lynn Rader was born on March 9, 1945 to Dorothea Mae Rader (n\u00e9e Cook) and William Elvin Rader, one of four sons. His brothers are Paul, Bill, and Jeff Rader. Although born in Pittsburg, Kansas, he grew up in Wichita. His parents both worked long hours and paid little attention to their children at home; Rader would later describe feeling ignored by his mother in particular, and resenting her for it.From a young age, Rader harbored sadistic sexual fantasies about torturing \"trapped and helpless\" women. He also exhibited zoosadism by torturing, killing and hanging small animals. Rader acted out sexual fetishes for voyeurism, autoerotic asphyxiation and cross-dressing; he would often spy on female neighbors while dressed in women's clothing, including women's underwear that he had stolen, and masturbate with ropes or other bindings around his arms and neck. Years later, during his \"cooling off\" periods between murders, Rader would take pictures of himself wearing women's clothes and a female mask while bound. He would later admit that he was pretending to be his victims as part of a sexual fantasy. Rader kept his sexual proclivities well-hidden, however, and was widely regarded in his community as \"normal\", \"polite\", and \"well mannered\".Rader attended Kansas Wesleyan University after high school, but received mediocre grades and dropped out after one year. He spent 1966\u20131970 in the United States Air Force. Upon discharge, he moved to Park City, where he worked in the meat department of a Leekers IGA supermarket where his mother was a bookkeeper. Rader married Paula Dietz on May 22, 1971, and they had two children, Kerri and Brian. He attended Butler County Community College in El Dorado, earning an associate degree in electronics in 1973. He then enrolled at Wichita State University, and graduated in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in administration of justice.\nRader initially worked as an assembler for the Coleman Company, an outdoor supply company. He worked at the Wichita-based office of ADT Security Services from 1974 to 1988, where he installed security alarms as part of his job, in many cases for homeowners concerned about the BTK killings. Rader was a census field operations supervisor for the Wichita area in 1989, before the 1990 federal census.In May 1991, Rader became a dogcatcher and compliance officer in Park City. In this position, neighbors recalled him as being sometimes overzealous and extremely strict, as well as taking special pleasure in bullying and harassing single women. One neighbor complained that Rader killed her dog for no reason.Rader was a member of Christ Lutheran Church and had been elected president of the church council. He was also a Cub Scout leader. On July 26, 2005, after Rader's arrest, his wife was granted an \"emergency divorce\" (waiving the normal waiting period).\n\n\n== Case history ==\n\n\n=== Murders ===\nOn January 15, 1974, four members of the Otero family were murdered in Wichita, Kansas. The victims were Joseph Otero, aged 38; Julie Otero, age 33; Joseph Otero Jr., age 9; and Josephine Otero; age 11. Their bodies were discovered by the family's eldest child, who was in 10th grade. After his 2005 arrest, Rader confessed to killing the Otero family. Rader wrote a letter that had been stashed inside an engineering book in the Wichita Public Library in October 1974, which described in detail the killing of the Otero family in January of that year.In early 1978, he sent another letter to television station KAKE in Wichita, claiming responsibility for the murders of the Oteros, Kathryn Bright, Shirley Vian and Nancy Fox. He suggested many possible names for himself, including the one that stuck: BTK. He demanded media attention in this second letter, and it was finally announced that Wichita did indeed have a serial killer at large. A poem was enclosed titled \"Oh! Death to Nancy,\" a parody of the lyrics to the American folk song \"O Death\". In the letter, he claimed to be driven to kill by \"factor X\", which he characterized as a supernatural element that also motivated the Jack the Ripper, Son of Sam, and Hillside Strangler murders.He also intended to kill others, such as Anna Williams, who in 1979, aged 63, escaped death by returning home much later than expected. Rader explained during his confession that he became obsessed with Williams and was \"absolutely livid\" when she evaded him. He spent hours waiting at her home but became impatient and left when she did not return home from visiting friends.Marine Hedge, aged 53, was found on May 5, 1985, at East 53rd Street North between North Webb Road and North Greenwich Road in Wichita. Rader had killed her on April 27, 1985, and he took her dead body to his church, the Christ Lutheran Church, where he was the president of the church council. There, he photographed her body in various bondage positions. Rader had previously stored black plastic sheets and other materials at the church in preparation for the murder and then later dumped the body in a remote ditch. He had called his plan \"Project Cookie\".In 1988, after the murders of three members of the Fager family in Wichita, a letter was received from someone claiming to be the BTK killer, in which the author of the letter denied being the perpetrator of the Fager murders. The author credited the killer with having done \"admirable work.\" It was not proven until 2005 that this letter was, in fact, written by Rader. He is not considered by police to have committed this crime. Additionally, two of the women Rader had stalked in the 1980s and one he had stalked in the mid-1990s filed restraining orders against him; one of them also moved away.His final victim, Dolores E. Davis, was found on February 1, 1991, at West 117th Street North and North Meridian Street in Park City. Rader killed her on January 19, 1991.\n\n\n=== Cold case ===\nBy 2004, the investigation of the BTK Killer was considered a cold case. Then, Rader initiated a series of 11 communications to the local media. This blunder led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, The Wichita Eagle received a letter from someone using the return address Bill Thomas Killman. The author of the letter claimed that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle on September 16, 1986, and enclosed photographs of the crime scene and a photocopy of her driver's license, which had been stolen at the time of the crime.Before this, it had not been definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK. DNA collected from under Wegerle's fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence. They then began DNA testing hundreds of men in an effort to find the serial killer. Altogether, over 1,300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order.In May 2004, television station KAKE in Wichita received a letter with chapter headings for the \"BTK Story\", fake IDs, and a word puzzle. On June 9, 2004, a package was found taped to a stop sign at the corner of First and Kansas in Wichita. It had graphic descriptions of the Otero murders and a sketch labeled \"The Sexual Thrill Is My Bill.\" Also enclosed was a chapter list for a proposed book titled The BTK Story, which mimicked a story written in 1999 by Court TV crime writer David Lohr. Chapter One was titled \"A Serial Killer Is Born.\" In July, a package dropped into the return slot at a public library contained more bizarre material, including the claim that he was responsible for the death of 19-year-old Jake Allen in Argonia, Kansas, earlier that month. This claim was false, and the death was ruled a suicide.After his capture, Rader admitted in his interrogation that he had been planning to kill again and he had set a date, October 2004, and was stalking his intended victim. In October 2004, a manila envelope was dropped into a UPS box in Wichita. It had many cards with images of terror and bondage of children pasted on them, a poem threatening the life of lead investigator Lt. Ken Landwehr, and a false autobiography with many details about Rader's life. These details were later released to the public.In December 2004, Wichita police received another package from the BTK killer. This time, the package was found in Wichita's Murdock Park. It had the driver's license of Nancy Fox, which was noted as stolen from the crime scene, as well as a doll that was symbolically bound at the hands and feet, and had a plastic bag tied over its head.In January 2005, Rader attempted to leave a cereal box in the bed of a pickup truck at a Home Depot in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck's owner. It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked what had become of it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.In his letters to police, Rader asked if his writings, if put on a floppy disk, could be traced or not. The police answered his question in a newspaper ad posted in the Wichita Eagle saying it would be safe to use the disk. On February 16, 2005, Rader sent a purple 1.44-Megabyte Memorex floppy disk to Fox TV affiliate KSAS-TV in Wichita. Also enclosed were a letter, a gold-colored necklace with a large medallion, and a photocopy of the cover of Rules of Prey, a 1989 novel about a serial killer.Police found metadata embedded in a deleted Microsoft Word document that was, unknown to Rader, still stored on the floppy disk. The metadata contained the words \"Christ Lutheran Church\", and the document was marked as last modified by \"Dennis.\" An Internet search determined that a \"Dennis Rader\" was president of the church council. When investigators drove by Rader's house, a black Jeep Cherokee (the type of vehicle seen in the Home Depot surveillance footage) was parked outside.\nThis was strong circumstantial evidence against Rader, but they needed more direct evidence to detain him.Police obtained a warrant to test a pap smear taken from Rader's daughter at the Kansas State University medical clinic. DNA tests showed a \"familial match\" between the pap smear and the sample from Wegerle's fingernails; this indicated that the killer was closely related to Rader's daughter, and combined with the other evidence was enough for police to arrest Rader.\n\n\n== Arrest ==\nRader was arrested while driving near his home in Park City shortly after noon on February 25, 2005. An officer asked, \"Mr. Rader, do you know why you're going downtown?\" Rader replied, \"Oh, I have suspicions why.\" Wichita Police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, and ATF agents searched Rader's home and vehicle, seizing evidence including computer equipment, a pair of black pantyhose retrieved from a shed, and a cylindrical container. The church he attended, his office at City Hall, and the main branch of the Park City library were also searched. At a press conference the next morning, Wichita Police Chief Norman Williams announced, \"the bottom line: BTK is arrested.\"\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\nOn February 28, 2005, Rader was charged with 10 counts of first degree murder. Soon after his arrest, the Associated Press cited an anonymous source alleging Rader had confessed to other murders in addition to those with which he had been connected;\nthe Sedgwick County district attorney denied this but refused to say whether Rader made any confessions or if investigators were looking into Rader's possible involvement in more unsolved killings. On March 5, news sources claimed to have verified by multiple sources that Rader had confessed to the 10 murders he was charged with, but no other ones.On March 1, Rader's bail was set at US$10 million, and a public defender was appointed to represent him. On May 3, the judge entered not guilty pleas on Rader's behalf, as Rader did not speak at his arraignment; however, on June 27, the scheduled trial date, Rader changed his plea to guilty. He described the murders in detail, and made no apologies.At Rader's August 18 sentencing, victims' families made statements, after which Rader apologized in a rambling 30-minute monologue that the prosecutor likened to an Academy Awards acceptance speech. His statement has been described as an example of an often-observed phenomenon among psychopaths: their inability to understand the emotional content of language. He was sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences, with a minimum of 175 years. Kansas had no death penalty at the time of the murders. On August 19, he was moved to the El Dorado Correctional Facility.Rader talked about innocuous topics such as the weather during the 40-minute drive to El Dorado, but began to cry when the victims' families' statements from the court proceedings came on the radio. He is now in solitary confinement for his protection (with one hour of exercise per day, and showers three times per week). This will likely continue indefinitely. Beginning in 2006, he was allowed access to television and radio, to read magazines, and other privileges for good behavior.\n\n\n=== Further investigations ===\nFollowing Rader's arrest, police in Wichita, Park City and several surrounding cities looked into unsolved cases with the cooperation of the state police and the FBI. They particularly focused on cases after 1994, when the death penalty was reinstated in Kansas. Police in surrounding states such as Nebraska, Missouri, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas also investigated cold cases that fit Rader's pattern to some extent. The FBI, and local jurisdictions at Rader's former duty stations checked into unsolved cases during Rader's time in the service.\nAfter exhaustive investigations, none of these agencies discovered any further murders attributable to Rader, confirming early suspicions that Rader would have taken credit for any additional murders that he had committed. The ten known murders are now believed to be the only murders for which Rader is actually responsible, although Wichita police are fairly certain that Rader stalked and researched a number of other potential victims. This includes one person who was saved when Rader called off his planned attack upon his arrival near the target's home due to the presence of construction and road crews nearby. Rader stated in his police interview that \"there are a lot of lucky people\", meaning that he had thought about and developed various levels of murder plans for other victims.\n\n\n=== Evaluation by Robert Mendoza ===\nMassachusetts psychologist Robert Mendoza was hired by Rader's court-appointed public defenders to conduct a psychological evaluation of Rader, and determine if an insanity-based defense might be viable. He conducted an interview after Rader pleaded guilty on June 27, 2005. Mendoza diagnosed Rader with narcissistic, antisocial and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders: He observed that Rader has a grandiose sense of self, a belief that he is \"special\" and therefore entitled to special treatment; a pathological need for attention and admiration; a preoccupation with maintaining rigid order and structure; and a complete lack of empathy for his victims.NBC claimed Rader knew the interview might be televised, but this was false according to the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office. Rader mentioned the interview during his sentencing statement. On October 25, 2005, the Kansas attorney general filed a petition to sue Mendoza and Tali Waters, co-owners of Cambridge Forensic Consultants, LLC, for breach of contract, claiming that they intended to benefit financially from the use of information obtained through involvement in Rader's defense. On May 10, 2007, Mendoza settled the case for US$30,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.\n\n\n== Victims ==\n\n\n== In media ==\nForensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland compiled Confession of a Serial Killer from her five-year correspondence with Rader.Multiple works draw on the case:\n\nStephen King has said his novella A Good Marriage, and the film based on it, were inspired by the BTK killer;similarly, novelist Thomas Harris has said that the character of Francis Dolarhyde in his 1981 novel Red Dragon is partially based on the then-unidentified BTK Killer.\nEpisode 15 of Season 1 (2006) of Criminal Minds is based on Rader's murders.\nA character evoking Rader appears, throughout seasons one and  two of the Netflix series Mindhunter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nI Survived BTK\nList of serial killers in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBeattie, Robert.

          "I am not sure if any dog park in Wichita does, but this does not have the dog park culture I have appreciated in other places.

Best in Wichita, though.",

        "wiki": "Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center is a performing arts and convention center in Wichita, Kansas, United States.  It is located between Douglas Street and Waterman Street near the east bank of the Arkansas River in downtown Wichita.\nCentury II is the largest center for entertainment, consumer shows and meetings in Wichita and is home to four arts organizations - Wichita Symphony Orchestra, Wichita Grand Opera, Music Theatre Wichita, and Music Theatre for Young People.\nThe facility has almost 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m2) of contiguous exhibit space, 20 meeting rooms, a Concert Hall that seats 2,197 people in continental seating, the Mary Jane Teall Theatre that seats 650 people in continental seating, and Convention Hall that seats 4,700 people.The Performing Arts and Convention Center hosted Miss USA pageants from 1990 to 1993 and Miss Teen USA 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe facility was designed by John M. Hickman and opened January 11, 1969 to commemorate the centennial anniversary of Wichita's incorporation in 1870. It was constructed on the site of The Forum, a convention center and exposition hall that opened in 1911.  By the 1960s, The Forum was showing its age and did not have adequate facilities that performances or shows required.The 1926 Wurlitzer organ from the Paramount Theatre (New York City) was removed prior to that theater's demolition and installed in the Century II Convention Hall. Prior to the demolition of the Paramount Theatre, the organ was acquired by Richard Simonton of Los Angeles. In the 1970s, the organ was moved to the Century II Convention Center in Wichita, Kansas. The organ continues to be used today for concerts and other events.\nThe building is a low circular structure with a shallow domed roof in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright.  A similar structure is the Marin County Civic Center in California.  John Hickman was an apprentice of Wright's at Taliesin West in the late 1940s.  A quote from the daughter of the architect, Susan Hickman, says that her father felt that the inspiration for the building was the vast fields of wheat (represented by the sand-colored pillars) and the limitless sky (by the pale blue-colored dome).  The lobby encircles the main level with convention hall, exhibition hall and concert hall occupying wedge-shaped areas within the ring.  The stages of the three spaces abut in the building's center.\nAn additional exhibit hall named for former Wichita City Commissioner and Mayor Bob Brown was added to the original structure in 1986.  The hall contains an additional 93,000 sq ft (8,600 m2) of exhibit space with an 8,000 sq ft (740 m2) lobby.  In 1997, the 303-room Hyatt Regency Wichita hotel was constructed and connected to the center.Renovations on the concert hall began in August 2010.  Work included painting, installation of new seats, carpeting and draperies and an upgrade of electrical systems.  Crews had a window of just less than two months to work between scheduled events.  In October, the center unveiled the renovated areas along with a new logo.  The logo was unpopular with many area residents and quickly dropped.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial websiteHistoricalHistory: Century II, The Forum, specialcollections.wichita.edu\nPhotos: Century II, \"The Forum\", \"Tractor Row\", wichitaphotos.org",

          "Love Century II!   They hold different fun events like the Wichita Women's Fair, Air Capital Comic Com, dog shows, car shows, Art & Book Fair, and music theater.  Went to many a production of Wichita Grand Opera until they moved way out \u2026",
          "Century II is a large complex that has various rooms available for events. There is plenty of room for stadium seating and floor seating. There is stages, restroom facilities and snack and other amenities. Centruy II does a lot of community \u2026",
          "We were there for \"Waitress\", a musical.  Brought to Wichita by Theatre League. Great reviews and awards on Broadway.  It was very good, great singing and acting. Some of the singers were very difficult to understand;  sometimes we had no \u2026",
          "I always enjoy my time in this iconic building.",
          "I love the different event shows at Century 2. The space is nice and large, and the climate control during extreme climates can be a haven when you are looking for an activity but the temps are nuts...like our 100 degree heat. Save this treasure! We DO NOT need more apartments on the river!!",
          "The show was good BUT could not hear what actors and actresses were saying.  We missed most of show because of that.  We sat in Row BB seats 7 and 8.  So if you want to get the most out of the show, sit much closer.  They do not have \u2026",
          "It\u2019s an amazing hall and my little brother occasionally plays here for his youth symphony. Produces an amazing sound with a lot of space for seating.",
          "We enjoy eating here when we visit in Wichita. We used to have one in our town but it closed for peculiar reasons. This is a great breakfast spot with large portions. Lots of different food options.",
          "Saw Wicked here. It was really nice",
          "This place was so spacious and perfect for the KMEA convention! This was the only time I had been, but I feel like there was not enough parking for how many people were there. But the building wasn't crowded at all!",
          "It was a cool concept but failed badly in execution . Very outdated and needs an update",
          "Century II has been an icon in Wichita for years. Could have better parking, but this is in downtown Wichita. I've attended many events here from The Nutcracker, Women's Fair, Car Shows, Home Shows, and Gun Shows. Nice facility, always good to be there. And you can always find a bathroom!!",
          "Another great show at Wichita's Century II - this time, Revolution: The Music of the Beatles - A Symphonic Experience.  Yet another delightful reason to keep the venue as part of whatever will be constructed to increase our city's capacity for mounting shows and events of all types and sizes.",
          "A jewel of Wichita. It may be old but it has a lot of character. This is perhaps the most iconic building of Wichita and though it needs some renovation it has a spirit that cannot be replaced in Wichita #savecenturyII",
          "The venue of Century 2 is incredible.  It iconic to the Wichita sky line and provides ample amount of square footage for any convention.   The architecture is unique and aesthetically pleasing.   A place I'd go to for many different functions.",
          "Century II is a Wichita icon with its unique architecture and look.  It is a little dated inside, but likely just needs some updating.  Attended the Air Capitol ComicCon which was fun and great that a city of Wichita's size could pull off. \u2026",
          "A great place for a concert! Comfortable seating and easy to find your way around. I wish these types of concert halls made easier access to restrooms and concessions for the people who want to sit in the middle. You inconvenience a lot of people if you need to get up for any reason. My only reason for not rating 5 stars.",
          "Keep Century 2. Great place for smaller conventions. Why must everything be huge, new and big? Why must everything be exactly like everyone else's in other cities. This could be the Wichita Space needle!",
          "The RV show held Jan 3rd-5th was awesome. So many fine folks showed up and had a blast! Great venue for sure.",
          "Great venue but you have to walk quite a ways from the parking lot to the door so be prepared. Upside... they do have ample parking:)",
          "Beautiful theater and space for big events! My cousin and I saw Cats when it came through in 2019. If you get a chance, it's always great to see a show at this iconic Wichita location! Love Century II!",
          "The show was great. Seating was roomy and adequate for the venue. It was easy to see from anywhere in auditorium and the acoustics were good. Love shows that appear on stage here because of the closer more personal experience than being in a huge arena or stadium.",
          "love the Wichita junior league holiday galleria there!  great event.   nice venue.   and for a good cause!   My wife has gone to the Wichita women's Fair there in February also. Again nice Center for events.",
          "This is a beautiful and iconic place that does its designer justice. I will be very sad to see this Wichita monument go if the politicians have their way. For those that don't know, this building was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright and designed by one of his students.",
          "Once space for trade shows and events.  Need to repurpose the performing arts into something else and build a new facility for them.  Add a parking garage to accommodate events and area growth.",
          "NMEA all-state band was spectacular to watch (shout out to Supreme Band Captain Section Leader Annie for the awesome performance)",
          "Loved the bridal expo!! There were so many different vendors with some beautiful pieces! And it was so clean and well managed!",
          "Century II is amazing place,  that despite needing updating  is still the best monument for Wichita.  \nWith some shiny panels on the perimeter ,or led screens  it can rival the KC Sprint center.\nHoping those words go to fruition.",
          "The food wasnt like it used to 10 years ago and the dance show was very boreing. This event was WAY over priced",
          "Visited here for music educators conference. Quality faculty. Clean, well maintained. Expensive concessions, but excellent venue for the conference.",
          "We were here for Martin Luther King Jr day to help build a house frame for Habitat for Humanity. Great space.",
          "Great acoustics. Very helpful staff. Seats were comfortable but shy on the legroom. I'm 6'2\" and was a bit cramped. Will definitely go there again.",
          "Love Century 2 Civic AND Convention Center. Large space easy access to the restrooms, and a snack bar.",

          "My husband and I took his parents! We had a blast. First time my hubby and I had been. I would recommend Entrap Games.",
          "LiCastro\u2019s Lair was awesome, we loved the theme and the creepiness! The game master did a great job and made the adventure much more amazing!",
          "Me, my husband, and 11yo daughter have done a lot of escape rooms. And we would recommend this highly! The story was fun, the room had a good flow, and it made sense. They were attentive to us and we felt welcomed. We left excited to come back and do the other rooms.",
          "Vampire theme escape room? Right up my alley! This is the 4th room we've completed at Entrap Games. We always come back, because they always make it an enjoyable experience.",
          "We did the 'easier' room and had a great time. So much fun working out puzzles and working with friends. THANK YOU for the awesome experience. The front desk/game master made this one of the best escape room experiences. Highly recommended the Wichita Entrap Games guys...",
          "There were 6 of us in the group ranging in ages from 24-63. We had a great time figuring out LiCastro's Lair. We were able to beat the clock so the adventure was successful! Will definitely go back to try other rooms. Lori C",
          "We were just two of us as it was raining heavily and hence had a very little crowd. But the experience was breath taking. Me and my 10 year old son had a great time. There were unexpected twists and turns which made the experience unforgettable. We will come back soon for sure",
          "First time ever. Very enjoyable, I never wanted to try an escape. Got talked into it and Im glad it was Entrapment.",
          "Lots of laughs and jump scares, the room we tried wasn't too difficult but challenging enough that at times we were stumped. I would definitely lock myself in one of these rooms again.",
          "Entrap was so much fun!!!! We will definitely come back! This is a great activity to do with friends or family members!",
          "We had a great time at Entrap in Wichita! Layton was the best game host and gave great clues! We will be back for sure!",
          "me and my wife went to entrap games as a fun date outing. We did the maze by ourselves as a way to bond and build communication, while having a ton of fun. All of those were achieved at Entrap games and the associates who worked there were super helpful with whatever we needed.",
          "Great room with some cool hidden elements (w/ fun music too)! Very nice staff that was very helpful as well. We would definitely come back to do another room!",
          "We had a group ages from 17-46 that had a blast. We needed something to do that would be fun for all ages.",
          "\u2018The Cure\u2019 was a very challenging but very fun room. There were only 4 of us...8 people of different ages, areas of expertise would be a perfect number to have. We will try another room when in town next.",
          "We took our figure skating team here while in Wichita for a competition. They had a great time and the staff was very helpful and flexible.",
          "We had a large group and they were very accommodating. Everyone had a great time. Thank you to the staff for making it a great experience!",
          "Our group experienced an absolute rush of excitement at Entrap Games! We did the missing musician room and had a blast! The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make it a special experience for our group. If I find myself in Wichita again I will definitely be",
          "We had a group of 4 going into the room. We all stayed engaged the entire time. Had a few hints from the staff but otherwise we had an awesome time. Would return!",
          "Staff was very friendly and helpful. Our team needed help and we entertained them as well lol great enviorment and clean fun. Will be back!",
          "We had a great time! It was challenging but not too hard. My kids had been to other rooms, but they liked the way this one was operated.",
          "It was lots of fun. My friends and I had a blast. The customer service was excellent and the puzzle was a good one not to easy not too hard.",
          "Our company had an amazing time. From setting up the event on a private day, to invoicing us, to the actual escape room- it was perfect.",
          "We had a great time and would all love to go again. It is worth the trip for sure. We made it out with only minutes to spare!",
          "It's always fun to be put in a teamwork scenario, with pressure of a clock ticking. Fun time to challenge your mind and patience",
          "We took my 13 yr old daughter and some of her friends there for her birthday and they had a blast! I would not recommend taking a child under 13, as there are some jump scares involved.",
          "Kids had lots of fun. Enjoyed that we could watch them as the played. We laughed a lot. It would be cool to maybe make the viewing room bigger with more seating.",
          "Went with the whole family age 20 to 60 everyone had a wonderful time! Will definetely go back sometime soon.",
          "It was a fun way to spend time together as a family in a way that used our different strengths. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun way to spend time together.",
          "great time was had by all! Went for a birthday get together with friends... staff was friendly and helpful.",
          "I've heard good things about these escape rooms from friends but actually going and doing one was so much fun!! I will definitely go back. Staff is super friendly and pictures afterwards are hilarious. Have some fun props. So in closing, just go and have a great time like I",
          "Had a great time! It was my first escape room and so I had no idea what to expect but it was a blast!",
          "It was fun. We had some un thought of complications in figuring our way out but it would have been a real issue to deal with if it were a real life situation so it just added to the drama/suspense. Definitely going again",
          "We did \"Off Limits\". It was a little hard to get started, but once you get the hang of it , you start looking at everything as a clue. The hour flew by and we wanted to do another room, but they were booked. So much fun! Highly recommend it and will be back next time we're in",
          "Great room with many surprises, had a group of 5 and had a great time! Got out with just minutes to spare. Will be going again soon!",
          "Very kind, helpful and fun people, this place is fabulous. 7 of us enjoyed the night. Yes all 7 and more will be returning to do the other 2 rooms. Very glad my daughter encouraged me to go. Thank you for the great experience.",
          "Lots of fun!!! It was a great girls night! Loved the experience, would definitely do it again and plan to!",

          "Took my nieces age 9 and 11 and we had a blast together! The Cure room was of great interest to my 11 year old niece who loves science!",
          "AWESOME! Took my wife there for Date Night! We had a blast! We kept laughing at ourselves and each other as we worked together trying to figure out the different clues and solve the mystery to exit the room. Great for a couple, small business or Church group looking for a fun",
          "This was lots of fun with a great deal of challenge. Enough to make you think yet not give up. There was 8 of us and we would have done another room immediately if one had been available.",
          "Our second trip, and will absolutely be back for the third room! The staff has always been super friendly and made the experience even more fun. The rooms are challenging, but hints are available. A perfect date night/friends day out to-do!",
          "We had a great time! We came together as a team and actually won! Lots of fun! Highly recommend it just for fun or for team building.",
          "We did this for my daughter 16th birthday so we had a mix of teens and adults and everyone had a blast. I would highly recommend trying it!",
          "It was a great team building event for my staff. It was easy to book and the staff was great. I'd love to do it again, in the other room or one of the new rooms coming in.",
          "It's is a little pricey, but a blast. Is it worth the price? I would say almost. I do recommend, but when I do I say it's pricey.",
          "Get some friends together and this is a great way to work together and have fun. Everyone gets involved and can include different ages. Put it on your list for a bad weather day!",
          "Our group of 8 included 4 adults and 4 teens all family. Everyone had a great time and can't wait to try another room.",
          "Nice place, spey friendly staff. Room was decent but I've been to a few on the easy coast that were a little better. I would still recommend it to anyone looking for something really fun to do with a group of friends or family!",
          "Had a great time. Felt like the musician room had too many locks and keys for clues, would've liked more clues such as the piano and message on the walls.",
          "We went there this evening and had a great time!!! We were able to get out with 4 minutes to spare! It was extremely professional, clean and nicely done! This experience was well worth our time & money!!",
          "Great time for parents and teens to work together to escape the room. Definitely worth the money!!!!",
          "This place was amazing! We did the musician room. We had so much fun and really had to think with this one. Staff were friendly and awesome.. would recommend to anyone\u00b0!",
          "The location added so much to the mystery then you walk in and feel so welcomed! We took our kids ages 9,8 and 7 to do the Rated G room! It was so fun, they found all the clues on their own and we were one step away when the timer ran out!! This was such a unique twist on a",
          "All ages were able to contribute and have fun! Very challenging and addictive!! Owner was super nice!",
          "The game was great. The leader was fine. Seriously bummed the cute signs for the after photo were \"kinda torn up so we threw them away.\" For $30 a person, you can't make new signs? Kinda lame business practice.",
          "We had so much fun! Our family of 8 had a time! It was challenging experience...a great chance for us all to work together! Diamond was very friendly and explained things well. We discussed our experience afterwards and the vote was unanimous....Excellent and we would do this",
          "We had a group of 8 in one room. We were running late at the restaurant so we weren't going to make our scheduled reservation time at Entrap. I called in to let them know and they were so nice and helpful. We got lucky that there was not a group reservation after ours, so they",
          "The escape room was challenging and fun. Diamond was very professional when dealing with a difficult customer's demands. I would do this again.",
          "I took my team here for our Xmas celebration and we had a great experience. We will definitely be back for another fun adventure.",
          "Fun time but poor management! Despite the management, I still recommend. There were 7 of us in my group.",
          "We had a really great time and would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for some poor management. The room is challenging and a good time, and Diamond and John were good game masters. This was our first escape room and thus we weren't very good at it, but we were given a few",
          "This was a family get together. Our daughter was home from Florida and our son joined us with his girlfriend. We hadn't been together as a family for several years because of the miles between all of us! We got along great and escaped the room with a few minutes to spare!!",
          "We were together for a mother/daughter weekend and decided to try this escape room. Our ages ranged from 30-84 years from grandaughters, mothers, and grandmother and thought we had enough smarts, skill, and talent to conquer on our own. Unfortunetly we waited too long before",
          "Two married couples in our late 40s, all professionals one being a doctor. We had a fantastic time. Made it out with only 32 seconds left and we were busy the whole time. The time flew by because it was so well put together and fun. We highly recommend this.",
          "We had a great time doing this for my mother's birthday. We reserved the room with 8 people so that we would all be in the same room, but I feel like 8 is too many. I'd say if I were to recommend anything, it would be to have 4-6 people do the game to improve communication. We",
          "We planned an outing for 7 girls to celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday. My first call to Entrap Games was to get information about the age requirement. I called at 10:00 in the morning and was asked to call back in an hour, which I did. 2nd call was made to reserve the room.",
          "We got paired up with one other couple. I understand you could have up to six people in this room, but four is the absolute perfect number. I would also recommend using your hints. I don't think we would have made it on our own. Our game master, destiny, was super cool and we",
          "Just say' we almost made it out. We had a great time and would do it again. Really made you think outside the box. Only improvement I can see, would be the game master should memorize the script and work on presenting the pre room setting. Thanks for a fun night",
          "Went with four family members. 2 others joined us in our adventure in the Alpha room. We all have to work together as a team to solve the puzzles. At times we didn't think we were going to make its out in time! Working together we were able to escape with 4 minutes left on the",
          "Visiting Wichita for the weekend we decided to give Entrap games a try. We had three teenagers (13-17) and three adults in our group. The room was challenging and fun. The room we did may not be good for younger kids (murder theme) but those 12 and above should be fine, I'm",
          "Our family ranges from ages 15 to 43. Each one of us had a great time! It was a very cool experience, and as the mom, a cool family bonding experience of teamwork. The theme may be considered PG-13. I didn't have a problem with my 15 y/o in the experience at all. Some parents",
          "This escape room in downtown Wichita was challenging, fun and interesting. When you have just over an hour of time and enjoy working together with family, friends or co-workers, you should definitely check this place out.",
          "This was so fun and exciting!! John was an amazing guide and we could tell he loved his job! It is definitely worth the money and the time!! If your in wichita go go go to entrap games!! We will be going again as soon as they get their new room!! It had our adrenaline rushing!!",
          "I took my two boys, 8 & 10 years old along with an 18year old. The room was a murder theme ( i'm thinking more like clue). Going into the room everything seemed fine, the diaries were not for kids to read about. Than from opening of a lock, draw and button, another door",
          "We had an absolute blast. Took a group of 8 managers from work. Was a very good team building activity, as we learned communication and problem solving. Game master John was outstanding and had us all engaged and ready to go. I think I might become an escape room junky",
          "This was so fun! I took my husband here for his birthday. He is really hard to impress and he loved it! Perfect for someone who doesn't do sporting events. You have to use your head and work as a team!",
          "Love this place! Went with friends on my husband's birthday. The game master John got all of us pumped before the game. Then once the game started, we were all scampering around hunting for clues. Some obvious, some hard. If you want a game where \"everyone is a winner\", this",
          "Our team of 6 had a great time! It was awesome and pretty challenging. We will definitely do it again when they have a new room!",
          "We had a group of 10 that went to Entrap Games as part of our work retreat. It was great for team-building and we all had a blast! The host was fun and accommodating. Already looking forward to their second room!",
          "What a blast! I took my whole family ages 9 - 24. Super fun family adventure. Our game master, John, was fun & energetic! Great for super competitive families like ours!",
          "A new addition to the Wichita scene, it's a fun way to spend an hour. Entrap Games is located in a historical building downtown. You'll find it in Mosley Street, just North of 3rd. According to our host, it was once a bakery, then later a recording studio. As of this review,",
          "A group of friends went and it was awesome. It was so much fun!! And the host was wonderful! We all definitely recommend going!",
          "What a fantastic experience! The puzzles were just hard enough to keep us challenged, but with just enough success to keep us motivated. The customer service was incredible. We can't wait till you get another puzzle room installed! Kudos!!!",
          "Such an awesome adventure! Everything about it was fun, the clues are tricky but not too difficult. I'm excited to try again sometime."

        "wiki": "College Hill is a historic, predominantly residential neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nCollege Hill was platted as a series of developments during a real estate speculation boom of the 1880s.  The name came from a proposed Methodist college that would have been located in the neighborhood at Douglas and Rutan, but the Methodist church instead choose to build its college, today known as Southwestern College, in Winfield, Kansas.  While a few houses in the neighborhood were built prior to the turn of the century, most were built between 1900 and 1934. In December 1926, the Lincoln Heights Addition between Douglas and Kellogg and Oliver and Crestway consisting of 73 acres and 250 lots was placed on the market. Construction of Lincoln Heights Shopping Center at Douglas and Oliver, begun in June 1948, was completed in July 1949.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCollege Hill is located at 37\u00b041\u203213\u2033N 97\u00b017\u203222\u2033W (37.686944, -97.289444) at an elevation of 1,360 feet (410 m). It comprises the area between Central Avenue to the north and U.S. Route 54 to the south and between Hillside Street to the west and Oliver Avenue to the east. Located approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) east of Downtown Wichita, College Hill borders the neighborhoods of Sleepy Hollow and Country Overlook to the north, Crown Heights North and Crown Heights South to the east, Fairfax and Longview to the south, and East Front and Uptown to the west.\n\n\n== College Hill Park ==\n\nCollege Hill Park is managed by the Wichita Department of Park and Recreation. The city park spans 22 acres (8.9 ha) and is located on English and Circle Drive south of Douglas Avenue. Amenities include a basketball court, playground, shuffleboard courts, swimming pool, and tennis courts.During Wichita\u2019s real estate boom days of the 1880s, when the city was known as the \"Peerless Princess of the Plains\", mule-drawn streetcars traveled up and down Douglas Avenue taking residents to and from work and shopping. A college was planned for the area where the park now is, and plans changed. The area that is now College Hill Park served as the Wichita Country Club from 1901\u20131912. It was redeveloped from an overgrown golf course into its current park configuration, including its swimming pool, via WPA funds during the Great Depression.Today, College Hill Park is a treasured place for families to stroll and play.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFor the purposes of representation on the Wichita City Council, College Hill lies within Council District 1.For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, College Hill is located in the 29th district of the Kansas Senate, represented by Democrat Oletha Faust-Goudeau, and the 84th district of the Kansas House of Representatives, represented by Democrat Gail Finney.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWichita Public Schools operates one school in the neighborhood: College Hill Elementary School. College Hill is part of the Wichita East High School and Robinson Middle School feeder systems.The Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita oversees one Catholic school in the neighborhood:  Blessed Sacrament School.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nAllen-Lambe House\nClifton Square\nCrown Uptown Theatre\nLincoln Heights Shopping Center\nWichita Community Theatre\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nDouglas Avenue is the main east-west street through College Hill.

The team compiled a 0\u20139 record (0\u20134 against conference opponents), finished last out of five teams in the MVC, and was outscored by a total of 381 to 99.  The team played its home games at Cessna Stadium in Wichita, Kansas.\nHead coach Ben Wilson, 14 players, and 16 others died on October 2 in the Wichita State University football team plane crash. Bob Seaman took over as head coach after the crash.\nThe team's statistical leaders included Rick Baehr with 513 passing yards, Don Gilley with 290 rushing yards and 12 points scored, Bill Moore with 175 receiving yards.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== Pre-season ==\nThe team included 22 returning lettermen led by junior quarterback Bob Renner, senior fullback Randy Jackson, and middle linebacker John Hoheisel.  Hoheisel, who was described by coach Wilson in the preseason as \"the heart and soul of our defense\", was selected as the team captain. Prior to the start of the season, second-year head coach Ben Wilson described his squad as a young club with good team speed, room to improve, and \"a chance to surprise a lot of people.\"\n\n\n== September games ==\nOn September 12, Wichita State opened its season with a 41\u201314 loss to Gene Stallings' Texas A&M Aggies before a crowd of 30,006 in College Station, Texas.

At the end of the season, a nationally televised fundraising program hosted by Monty Hall was aired to raise money for the victims of the two crashes.\n\n\n== \"Second season\" ==\nAfter the crash, the team's scheduled games against Utah State and Southern Illinois were cancelled. However, the surviving members of the team voted 76-to-1 to complete the 1970 schedule. The remaining portion of the schedule was designated the \"second season.\" Assistant coach Bob Seaman took over as the team's head coach after the crash.On October 24, 1970, the team played the first game after the crash. With permission from the NCAA, the Shockers played seven freshmen in their starting lineup.  Facing an Arkansas team ranked No. 9 in the country, Wichita lost by a 62\u20130 score. The Arkansas crowd cheered for the effort demonstrated by Wichita State, and Arkansas coach Frank Broyles benched his first team after seven minutes and used 61 players in the game.On October 31, the Shockers lost by at 35\u20135 score to Cincinnati before a homecoming crowd of 27,210.Prior to the game, a 15-minute ceremony featuring astronaut John Swigert was held to commemorate the team's return to Cessna Stadium for its first game since the crash. The Shockers started seven freshmen and 10 sophomores and scored seven points on a 37-yard field goal by John Potts and a safety when Cincinnati quarterback Bill Carter was tackled in the end zone.On November 7, the Shockers showed marked improvement in a 21\u201312 loss to Tulsa. Trailing 21\u20136 in the fourth quarter, Wichita's freshman quarterback Tom Owen threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to wingback Tim Thissen to narrow the score to 21\u201312.On November 14, Wichita lost to Memphis State by a 51\u20136 score. The Shockers only points were scored in the first quarter on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Tom Owen to Eddie Plopa.On November 21, the Shockers lost to North Texas State by a 41\u201324 score. The highlight of the game for Wichita was a 105-yard kickoff return by tailback Don Gilley in the first quarter. Wichita's freshman quarterback Rick Baher also threw two touchdown passes, and John Potts kicked a 47-yard field goal.In the final game of the season, the Shockers took a 17\u20130 lead over Lee Corso's bowl-bound Louisville Cardinals.

          "Did The Attic with a group of friends. The puzzles are very well made and require a good deal of thought. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their rooms in the future",
          "Great place for fun solving puzzles using clues and teamwork",
          "We had a great time here at Wichita Room Escape, had to book a second room for the same day. The game master was great at over seeing us and our team was awesome! The rooms were intricate and had plenty of locks to get to. Really enjoyed the room and staff.",

          "Honestly I would never go anywhere else but here for a room escape. The manager and staff were fantastic, so helpful and so sweet & so helpful and understanding with rescheduling our time. The rooms are always a joy and I love the themes! My family and I always have an amazing time here. Loved it, Recommend 100%!",

There were a couple snags, but nothing that stopped us in our tracks. There was a nice variety of puzzles in the room. We'll be back.",

        "wiki": "\"Wichita Linebacker\" is the third episode of the third season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars, and the forty-seventh episode overall. Written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by Harry Winer, the episode premiered on The CW on October 17, 2006.\nThe series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica helps a football player, Kurt Fenstermacher (Armie Hammer) retrieve his stolen playbook. Meanwhile, Piz (Chris Lowell) gains a job at the college radio station, and Veronica meets Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) for the first time after she gets in trouble for events related to the events that occurred in the previous episode, \"My Big Fat Greek Rush Week\".\nPhil Klemmer and John Enbom, the writers of the episode, found the episode difficult to write because they were not very familiar with American football. However, they decided to resolve the problem by making the episode as little about football as possible. \"Wichita Linebacker\" also features a guest appearance by Armie Hammer, as well as the first appearances by Begley, Jr. as Cyrus O'Dell and Ryan Devlin as Mercer Hayes. The episode received mixed to negative reviews, with criticism primarily focusing on the case of the week.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nVeronica watches a football practice before she expresses her frustration with Logan (Jason Dohring). Later, she meets Weevil (Francis Capra), who is working at a car wash. Veronica is called into the Dean O'Dell's office, and he threatens her with expulsion if she does not give up some names in relation to the sorority marijuana scandal. Piz calls Veronica in to help a football player, Kurt Fenstermacher, retrieve his playbook, with Kurt's girlfriend, Trish (Lindsey McKeon) paying for the investigation. Veronica's only suggestion is that he gets a new one. Veronica convinces her father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), to hire Weevil as his new assistant at Mars Investigations. In an attempt to print a playbook for Kurt, Veronica disguises herself as a cheerleader, but fails to print one. After being called back into the Dean's office, Veronica is in the room during a debate between fraternity boys and feminists. Veronica goes back to the football player, and she hypothesizes that his girlfriend\u2019s ex-boyfriend stole it. Weevil helps Keith at detective work, succeeding beyond Keith's expectations.\nVeronica talks to the ex-boyfriend before learning that Kurt's best friend is probably guilty. Veronica gets a disturbing phone call from Logan, so she tracks his cell phone, finding him gambling. Veronica and Logan have a fight before she learns that Keith had to stop working for a client when Weevil hit a suspect; Keith feels required to fire Weevil. Veronica tells Weevil the news before she gives him a job fixing the Dean\u2019s car. Veronica confronts the best friend, but he\u2019s not the perpetrator, and Veronica suddenly realizes that Trish is. Veronica lies to Trish about what happened to Kurt in order to elicit a true reaction from her; this plan works, and Veronica learns that Trish took the playbook in order to get him off the team. However, she lost it in the process. Kurt, Trish, and Veronica track it down to the ex-boyfriend, who gave the plays to another team to spite the couple.\nVeronica goes to Dean O\u2019Dell and asks for an exchange: Veronica tells him that his son spray-painted his car, and he will hire Weevil. Veronica talks to the gambling owner, who acts strangely. Veronica tracks his car before removing the tracker later. Veronica talks to Trish, who says that Kurt left for Kansas. Weevil starts his new job as a Hearst janitor. Piz gets a job on a campus radio show, where he interviews both the feminists and the fraternity boys. In the middle of the show, the feminists get a text that says that Claire, the girl who the fraternity boys pointed out, was raped. Veronica and Logan reconcile their relationship and kiss.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe episode was written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought that they would be unable to write the episode because they didn't know very much about American football\u2014so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, \"Rob just sort of handed [the episode] down. I think if you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why.\" The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.The episode features the first appearance of Dean Cyrus O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), a recurring character for the third season. Initially, Michael McKean was slated to take the role, but within twelve hours of accepting the part, McKean decided to pass on Veronica Mars altogether. Thomas called this \"the most depressing casting news in the world.\" One week later, Begley accepted the role. Both actors had recently appeared in A Mighty Wind. \"Wichita Linebacker\" also includes a guest appearance by Armie Hammer, who plays Kurt Fenstermacher, the football player whose playbook is stolen. Ryan Devlin makes his first appearance as Mercer Hayes, a Hearst College student who would be convicted in the serial rape case in the episode \"Spit & Eggs\". Despite having this role on Veronica Mars, Devlin would go on to play Duncan Kane, a role originated by Teddy Dunn before he left the show in \"Donut Run\", in the spinoff web series Play It Again, Dick.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\nIn its original broadcast, \"Wichita Linebacker\" received 3.12 million viewers, ranking 84th of 92 in the weekly rankings. This figure was a slight increase from the previous episode, \"My Big Fat Greek Rush Week\", which was viewed by 2.96 million viewers.\n\n\n=== Reviews ===\n\"Wichita Linebacker\" received mixed to negative reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating that it was \"good\". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that \"as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one,\" that \"the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't seem to be getting the proper weight it requires,\" and that \"there's also some strange tonal issues currently.\" However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to \"Wichita Linebacker\" as \"what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen.\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \"C+\". \"I don't think it's being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well.\" In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. \"That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time.\"Price Peterson of TV.com wrote that while he \"liked it overall\", he disliked the focus on Logan and Weevil, writing that he was \"more than ready for Weevil to be written off the show\" and, \"I'm getting slightly tired of [Logan's] storylines. He seems to be alternating between woe-is-me hangdog and shifty bro liar. [\u2026] Logan is not my favorite.\" On his blog What's Alan Watching, Alan Sepinwall wrote that \"this was a fairly light-hearted hour, with the two darkest events -- Weevil beating up the abusive boyfriend and the blonde getting raped -- taking place off-screen. And if the purpose of doing shorter arcs was to avoid the loss of momentum that both the bus crash and the bridge stabbing suffered in the middle of last year, I'm not sure if it's working yet.\" BuzzFeed ranked the episode 47th on its ranking of Veronica Mars episodes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Wichita Linebacker\" on IMDb\n\"Wichita Linebacker\" at Mars Investigations",

          "Great experience! The place was clean, the rooms were put together very well, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Would definitely go back and recommend to others!",
          "3 of us came down from Topeka and did the Voodoo room and the N.3.R.D.5. room. This one is a bit different as you go until you escape so you get to do the whole room no matter what. Rooms were fun and the owner was a great host. We will be back to do the new room after it opens.",

          "So much fun that we came back to do another room the very same day.",

          "This place is Awesome!! You have to check it out!! The rooms are awesome. Well maintained and very clean!",
          "I believe they are the cheapest \"escape rooms\" in town. While this place may not be huge and elaborate, they have very challenging puzzles that everyone will enjoy. Staff is friendly and will assist if needed. They have rooms for all different skill levels.",
          "Awesome place! Will be going back to try the other room.",

          "Good price, and they were open Christmas Eve for us which was very nice and unexpected.  Only did 1 room but it was a bit underwhelming. It was more a key opens a box with a key that opens another box. With few math puzzles or riddles like \u2026",
          "So much fun! Definitely will be back!",

        "wiki": "Riverside is a neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas, United States. A mostly residential area located between the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, it is home to several of the city's museums and large parks.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRiverside was founded in March 1886 when the Riverside Land Company, led by developer James Oakley Davidson, had the area surveyed and platted. The company intended for the new neighborhood to be Wichita's most stylish residential area and supported the construction of bridges and a trolley line to connect it to downtown.  The local real estate market collapsed the next year, however, and development stalled for a decade. By 1889, several of the company's investors, including Davidson and Burton Campbell, had built large, luxurious homes for themselves. Campbell's mansion, modeled after a Scottish castle, became known as Campbell Castle or Crumb Castle locally and was eventually designated a historical landmark.In 1897, the Wichita city government purchased land in the neighborhood and began developing parks. It also built two more bridges, increasing access to the area and attracting more home buyers. Riverside became a popular recreational area for local residents, and development continued over the ensuing decades. The Riverside Boathouse opened on the Little Arkansas River in the late 1890s followed by a zoo in Central Riverside Park in 1921 and a public swimming pool in South Riverside Park in 1923. The Wichita Art Museum opened in 1935. In 1938, the Works Progress Administration replaced the pool with a second pool called Municipal Beach.Beginning in the 1960s, further development changed Riverside dramatically as new sites opened and others closed. The Boathouse was demolished in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal program. Similarly, the zoo was closed and torn down in 1973 with the opening of the Sedgwick County Zoo in the western part of the city. In the 1970s, the city funded the construction a new facility for the Art Museum. To commemorate the United States Bicentennial, the city had The Keeper of the Plains, a 44-foot steel sculpture by artist Blackbear Bosin, erected at the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers in 1974. The Mid-America All-Indian Center opened in 1976. That same year, the public Ralph Wurz Tennis Center opened on the former site of Municipal Beach. In 1987, the city opened Botanica, The Wichita Gardens in Riverside.Today, Riverside is regarded as a historic neighborhood known for its architecture and as a cultural and recreational center in Wichita. It has also become a popular residential area for college students and young professionals.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRiverside is located at 37\u00b041\u203255\u2033N 97\u00b021\u203235\u2033W (37.698611, -97.359722) at an elevation of 1,306 feet (398 m). The Arkansas River forms its western and southern border, 13th Street North its northern border, and Bitting Street, the Little Arkansas River, and Nims Street its eastern border. The confluence of the two rivers forms the neighborhood's southeastern corner. Located immediately northwest of Downtown Wichita, Riverside borders Midtown to the east and North Riverside to the north. Delano lies across the Arkansas River to the south; Indian Hills lies across the river to the west.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFor the purposes of representation on the Wichita City Council, Riverside lies within Council District 6.For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, Riverside is located in the 25th and 29th districts of the Kansas Senate and the 92nd district of the Kansas House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWichita Public Schools operates one facility in the neighborhood:  Riverside Leadership Magnet Elementary School.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nThe Wichita Department of Park and Recreation maintains five parks in Riverside:  Oak Park, Sim Park, Central Riverside Park, North Riverside Park, and South Riverside Park. Situated on West 11th Street, Oak Park occupies 37.5 acres (15.2 ha) on the east bank of the Little Arkansas River and includes a frisbee disc golf course, nature trails, and a natural habitat area. 181.48-acre (73.44 ha) Sim Park lies on the east bank of the Arkansas River and is divided into several areas:  the Arthur B. Sim Municipal Golf Course, a large picnic area, a natural habitat area, Botanica, and the Old Cowtown Museum.  The park also includes a fitness trail with exercise stations.The three Riverside Parks form the heart of the city park system.  The largest, Central Riverside Park, spans 58 acres (23 ha) on the west bank of the Little Arkansas River and hosts an open air bandstand, playground, and interactive water fountain as well as outdoor art sculptures and historic structures. It is also home to the city's Spanish-American Memorial and a small zoo, the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit. North Riverside Park covers 30 acres (12 ha) on the river's east bank immediately southeast of Oak Park.  It is the site of several historical structures including Park Villa, a stone and tile-roofed meetinghouse used for community gatherings. The 30-acre (12 ha) South Riverside Park sits on West Central Avenue in a horseshoe bend of the Little Arkansas's course and is home to the Ralph Wurz Riverside Tennis Center.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nBotanica, The Wichita Gardens\nThe Keeper of the Plains\nMid-America All-Indian Center\nOld Cowtown Museum\nWichita Art Museum\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nNims is the main north-south street through Riverside. North of River Boulevard, its name changes to Bitting Street. River Boulevard follows a winding course along the west bank of the Little Arkansas River. South of Murdock Street, its name changes to Stackman Drive. Other arterial roads include 13th Street, which runs east-west along the northern edge of the neighborhood, and Seneca, a north-south street which enters Riverside from the south and turns east to become Central Avenue.Wichita Transit offers bus service to Riverside on its 17 route.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Wichita ( WITCH-i-taw) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Sedgwick County. As of 2019, the estimated population of the city was 389,938. Wichita is the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 644,888 in 2018.Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown.\"In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city became an aircraft production hub known as \"The Air Capital of the World.\" Textron Aviation, Learjet, Airbus, and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American aircraft industry. Wichita is also home to McConnell Air Force Base, and Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, the largest airport in Kansas.\nAs an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena and Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center. The city's Old Cowtown Museum maintains historical artifacts and exhibits on the city's early history. Wichita State University is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 B.C. In 1541, a Spanish expedition led by explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado found the area populated by the Quivira, or Wichita, people. Conflict with the Osage in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to European settlement of the region, the site was in the territory of the Kiowa.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nClaimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it became part of Kansas Territory in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.The Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in Indian Territory by Confederate forces in the American Civil War, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to Texas which became known as the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.In 1868, trader James R. Mead was among a group of investors who established a town company and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and German immigrant William \"Dutch Bill\" Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city's first streets. Wichita formally incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870.\n\nWichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". Across the Arkansas River, the town of Delano became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement. The area had a reputation for violence until local lawmen, Wyatt Earp among them, began to assertively police the cowboys. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to Dodge City. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.Rapid immigration resulted in a speculative land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into Wichita State University, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became Friends University, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after Kansas City and Topeka with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, there were five operating refineries in Wichita with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded Derby Oil, and Fred C. Koch, who established what would become Koch Industries, both began in Wichita during this period.The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited Chicago aircraft builder Emil \"Matty\" Laird to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the Swallow Airplane Company. Two early Swallow employees, Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, Stearman Aircraft in 1926 and Beechcraft in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started his own company in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the \"Air Capital of the World\" in 1929.\n\nOver the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman's Wichita facilities became part of Boeing which would become the city's largest employer. Initial construction of Wichita Municipal Airport finished southeast of the city in 1935. During World War II, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bomber. In 1951, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish McConnell Air Force Base. By 1954, all non-military air traffic had shifted to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport west of the city. In 1962, Lear Jet Corporation opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health care products maker Mentholatum in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping gear retailer Coleman started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of fast food franchises started in Wichita, beginning with White Castle in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including Pizza Hut in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.Wichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous temperance extremist Carrie Nation struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas's prohibition ordinance. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for desegregation. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of George Tiller. Tiller was later killed in Wichita by an extremist in 2009.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nExcept for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to re-develop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. Intrust Bank Arena opened downtown in 2010.Boeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus maintaining facilities in Wichita.Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the Kansas native and U.S. President in 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDowntown Wichita is at 37\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 97\u00b020\u203210\u2033W (37.688888, \u221297.336111), at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m). Wichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 54. Part of the Midwestern United States, it is 157 mi (253 km) north of Oklahoma City, 181 mi (291 km) southwest of Kansas City, and 439 mi (707 km) east-southeast of Denver.The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area's topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies Chisholm Creek, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks as well as, further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 163.59 sq mi (423.70 km2), of which 159.29 sq mi (412.56 km2) is land and 4.30 sq mi (11.14 km2) is water.As the core of the Wichita metropolitan area, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, Valley Center, Park City, Kechi, and Bel Aire. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is Eastborough. Adjacent to the city's east side is Andover. McConnell Air Force Base is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, are Derby and Haysville. Goddard and Maize border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWichita lies within the transitional zone of the humid subtropical climate zone and the humid continental climate zone (K\u00f6ppen Cfa/Dfa), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the Great Plains, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer months. These occasionally bring large hail as well as frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history: in September 1965; during the Andover, Kansas Tornado Outbreak of April 1991; and during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s while cold air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0 \u00b0F. Wind speed in the city averages 13 mph (21 km/h). On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and June the wettest.The average temperature in the city is 56.9 \u00b0F (13.8 \u00b0C). Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 32.2 \u00b0F (0.1 \u00b0C) in January to 81.1 \u00b0F (27.3 \u00b0C) in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) an average of 62 days a year and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) on an average 8.5 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was \u221222 \u00b0F (\u221230 \u00b0C) on February 12, 1899. Readings as low as \u221217 \u00b0F (\u221227 \u00b0C) and as high as 111 \u00b0F (44 \u00b0C) occurred as recently as February 10, 2011 and July 29\u201330, 2012, respectively. Wichita receives on average about 32.69 inches (830 mm) of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 88 days of measurable precipitation. The average relative humidity is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages 15.6 inches (40 cm). Measurable snowfall occurs an average of ten days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on five of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 15 days a year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 26 through April 11.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nWichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The downtown area is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the Epic Center. Old Town is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.\nTwo notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the 120-acre (0.49 km2) Riverside Park. upscale College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city.Four other historic neighborhoods\u2014developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near Boeing, Cessna and Beech aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary World War II housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 51st largest city in the United States. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,304.8 per square mile (889.9/km2). There were 167,310 housing units at an average density of 1,022.1 per square mile (475.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% White, 11.5% African American, 4.8% Asian, 1.2% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 15.3% of the population.Of the 151,818 households, 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a male householder with no wife present, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families. 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48, and the average family size was 3.14.The median age in the city was 33.9 years. 26.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.The median income for a household in the city was $44,477, and the median income for a family was $57,088. Males had a median income of $42,783 versus $32,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,517. About 12.1% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nWichita is the principal city of both the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Wichita-Winfield Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, Butler, Harvey, and Sumner counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.The larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes Cowley County and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby Reno County is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIt is the birthplace of famous restaurants such as White Castle and Pizza Hut. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top 25 Kansas-based brands such as Koch, Coleman, Cessna, Pizza Hut, Beechcraft, Freddy's and more are based in Wichita.Wichita's principal industrial sector is manufacturing, which accounted for 21.6 percent of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.Healthcare is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing approximately 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical care tower at Wesley Medical Center. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system's fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children's Hospital, the first and only children's hospital in the Wichita area.Thanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring Butler County, Kansas, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former Derby Oil Company, which was purchased by Coastal Corporation in 1988. Wichita is home to oil & natural gas organizations Kansas Strong and Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association (KIOGA)\nKoch Industries and Cargill, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. Cargill Meat Solutions Div., at one time the nation's 3rd-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer Chance Morgan, gourmet food retailer Dean & Deluca, renewable energy company Alternative Energy Solutions, and Coleman Company, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. Air Midwest, the nation's first officially certificated \"commuter\" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's 8th largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was: 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).The cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0. As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.Wichita has a national reputation in U.S. media as an affordable and pleasant place to live. In July 2006, CNN/Money and Money ranked Wichita ninth on their list of the 10 best U.S. big cities in which to live.  In 2008, MSN Real Estate ranked Wichita 1st on its list of most affordable cities.  Wichita was also named the most \"Uniquely American\" city by Newsmax magazine in a May 2009 piece written by Peter Greenberg.  However, in its 2019 \"Best Places to Live\" survey, U. S. News & World Report, ranked Wichita at #79 out of 125 U.S. cities, and noted that violent crime in Wichita had risen over the previous few years.  In the 2019 KIDS COUNT Data Book, in its annual \"State Rankings on Overall Child Well-Being,\" Kansas was ranked No. 15 out of the 50 states. However, the state has a significantly higher rate of child incarceration than the nation, generally, and a higher rate of the state taking children from their homes.\n\n\n=== Aircraft manufacturing ===\n\nFrom the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, \"Matty\" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, Al Mooney and Bill Lear began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that would lead to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations E. M. Laird Aviation Company (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), Travel Air (started by Beech, Stearman and Cessna), Stearman, Cessna, Beechcraft and Mooney were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932.  By 1931, Boeing (of Seattle, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating \"Boeing-Wichita\", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita having merged into Textron Aviation in 2014, along with Learjet and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and Bombardier (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to depress the aviation sub-sector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., Hawker Beechcraft and Raytheon Aircraft Co.\u2014to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users. In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine light aircraft to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for Spirit Aerosystems to open its plant.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nWichita has a complex cultural mix, dominated by Euro-American, blue-collar industrial and rural tastes, but embracing, to various degrees, classical arts and music, diverse domestic and foreign cultures (Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian, British and Irish cultural influences and activities are conspicuous), and avant garde cultural activity.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nWichita is a cultural center for Kansas, home to several art museums and performing arts groups. The Wichita Art Museum is the largest art museum in the state of Kansas and contains 7,000 works in permanent collections. The Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University is a modern and contemporary art museum with over 6,300 works in its permanent collection.Small art galleries are scattered around the city with some clustered in the districts of Old Town, Delano and south Commerce street. These galleries started the Final Friday Gallery crawl event, where visitors tour attractions free in the evening on the last Friday of each month.

        "wiki": "Hopalong Cassidy or Hop-along Cassidy is a fictional cowboy hero created in 1904 by the author Clarence E. Mulford, who wrote a series of short stories and novels based on the character.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nIn his early writings, Mulford portrayed the character as rude, dangerous, and rough-talking. He had a wooden leg which caused him to walk with a little \"hop\", hence the nickname. The character was played by movie actor William Boyd starting in 1935. The Cassidy character in films was adapted from Mulford's books and  transformed into a clean-cut, sarsaparilla-drinking hero. Sixty-six popular films appeared, only a few of which were loosely based on Mulford's stories.\n\n\n== Film history ==\n\nAs portrayed on the screen, white-haired Bill \"Hopalong\" Cassidy was usually clad strikingly in black (including his hat, an exception to the Western film stereotype that only villains wore black hats). He was reserved and well spoken, with a sense of fair play. He was often called upon to intercede when dishonest characters took advantage of honest citizens. \"Hoppy\" and his white horse, Topper, usually traveled through the West with two companions\u2014one young and trouble-prone with a weakness for damsels in distress, the other older, comically awkward and outspoken.The juvenile lead was successively played by James Ellison, Russell Hayden, George Reeves, Rand Brooks, and Jimmy Rogers. George Hayes (later to become known as \"Gabby\" Hayes) originally played Cassidy's grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer Harry Sherman, he was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian Andy Clyde as California Carlson. Clyde, the most durable of the sidekicks, remained with the series until it ended. A few actors of future prominence appeared in Cassidy films, notably Robert Mitchum, who appeared in seven films at the beginning of his career.\nThe 66 Hopalong Cassidy pictures were filmed by independent producers who released the films through the studios. The first \"Hoppies\", as the films were known, were distributed by Paramount Pictures to favorable returns, and United Artists was the distributor after Paramount. They were noted for fast action and outdoor photography (usually by Russell Harlan). Harry Sherman wanted to make more ambitious movies and tried to cancel the Cassidy series, but popular demand forced Sherman back into production, this time for United Artists. Sherman gave up the series in 1944, but William Boyd wanted to keep it going. To do this, he gambled his future on Hopalong Cassidy, mortgaging most of what he owned to buy the character rights from Mulford and the backlog of movies from Sherman.\nIn the first film, Hopalong Cassidy (then spelled \"Hop-along\") got his name after being shot in the leg. Hopalong's \"drink of choice\" was the nonalcoholic sarsaparilla.\n\n\n== Television and radio ==\n\nBoyd resumed production in 1946, on lower budgets, and continued through 1948, when \"B\" westerns were being phased out. Boyd thought Hopalong Cassidy might have a future in television, spent $350,000 to obtain the rights to his old films, and approached the fledgling NBC network. The initial broadcasts were so successful that NBC could not wait for a television series to be produced and edited the feature films to broadcast length. On June 24, 1949, Hopalong Cassidy became the first network Western television series.The success of the television series made Boyd a star. The Mutual Broadcasting System began broadcasting a radio version, with Andy Clyde (later George MacMichael on Walter Brennan's ABC sitcom The Real McCoys) as the sidekick (except for episodes 28 to 53 of the 105 episode series, when, for reasons unknown, he was replaced by several different radio actors), in January 1950. At the end of September, the show moved to CBS Radio, where it ran until 1952.The series and character were so popular that Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the cover of national magazines such as Look, Life, and Time. Boyd earned millions as Hopalong ($800,000 in 1950 alone), mostly from merchandise licensing and endorsement deals. In 1950, Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the first lunchbox to bear an image, causing sales of Aladdin Industries lunch boxes to jump from 50,000 units to 600,000 units per year. In 1950, more than 100 companies manufactured $70 million of Hopalong Cassidy products, including children's dinnerware, pillows, roller skates, soap, wristwatches (made by Timex), and jackknives.There was a new demand for Hopalong Cassidy features in movie theaters, and Boyd licensed reissue distributor Film Classics to make new film prints and advertising accessories. Another 1950 enterprise saw the home-movie company Castle Films manufacturing condensed versions of the Paramount films for 16 mm and 8 mm film projectors; they were sold through 1966. Also, in January 1950 Dan Spiegel began to draw a syndicated comic strip with scripts by Royal King Cole; the strip lasted until 1955.Thanks to the earlier series which showed edited versions of his films, Boyd began work on a separate series of half-hour westerns made especially for television; Edgar Buchanan was his new sidekick, Red Connors (a character from the original stories and a few of the early films). The theme music for the television show was written by Nacio Herb Brown (music) and L. Wolfe Gilbert (lyrics). The show ranked number 7 in the 1949 Nielsen ratings, number 9 in the 1950-1951 season and number 28 in 1951-1952. The success of the show and tie-ins inspired juvenile television westerns such as The Range Rider, Tales of the Texas Rangers, Annie Oakley, The Gene Autry Show, and The Roy Rogers Show.\nAfter Boyd's death, his company devoted to Hopalong Cassidy, U.S. Television Office, retained control of Cassidy films but, by the mid-1960s, had withdrawn them from television and sales in home movie markets.  This remained the situation until the mid-1990s, after many Cassidy fans had died, when the company made available to The Western Channel a package series of restored and cleaned negative-based prints of the films to cable TV.  These remained available on that channel until 2000, when they were again withdrawn.  Minimal effort was made at that time, nor has it been made since, to offer the films for home video, excepting two packages of compressed, multi-title Hopalong Cassidy anthology DVDs, the first requiring purchase of the entire TV series to obtain copies of about a dozen films and then, in 2014, a reissue of the remaining stock of these same DVD pressings combined with the remaining titles in a first-time pressing.\nThe TV series can be currently seen on Cozi TV.\nAnd on Encore's western channels in 2018.\n\n\n== Hoppyland ==\nOn May 26, 1951, an amusement park named Hoppyland opened in the Venice section of Los Angeles. This was an expansion and retheming of Venice Lake Park (opened the previous year) as Boyd became an investor. Standing on 80 acres (320,000 m2) it included a roller coaster, miniature railroads, pony rides, boat ride, Ferris wheel, carousel, and other thrill rides along with picnic grounds and recreational facilities. Despite Boyd's regular appearances as Hoppy at the park, it was not a success and shut down in 1954.\n\n\n== In other media ==\nIn the closing chapter of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, the eponymous anti-hero's father, Henry C. Gatz, filling out his son's early character, is described \"..pull(ing) from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. \u2018Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.\u2019\"\n\n\n=== Novels by other authors ===\nLouis L'Amour wrote four Hopalong Cassidy novels, which are still in print. In 2005, author Susie Coffman published Follow Your Stars, new stories starring the character. In three of these stories, Coffman wrote the wife of actor William Boyd into the stories.\n\n\n=== Comic books/comics strips ===\nFawcett Comics published a Hopalong Cassidy comic book one-shot in 1943, followed by an ongoing series from 1946\u20131953 (numbered #1 through 85), when the company ceased publishing. DC Comics took over the title in 1954 with issue #86, publishing it until issue #135, in 1959.Mirror Enterprises Syndicate distributed a Hopalong Cassidy comic strip starting in 1949; it was bought out by King Features in 1951, running until 1955. The strip was drawn by Dan Spiegle.\n\n\n=== Record readers ===\nBeginning in 1950, Capitol Records released a series of Hopalong Cassidy \"record readers\" featuring William Boyd and music by Billy May, produced by Alan W. Livingston.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe song \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" includes a reference to Hopalong boots as a holiday gift desired by children.  Hopalong Cassidy is also referred to in Buddy Alan and Don Rich's 1970 Top Twenty hit, \"Cowboy Convention\".  In 1973, fellow move cowboy Roy Rogers released a nostalgic ballad called Hoppy, Gene and me.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThere have been museum displays of Hopalong Cassidy. The major display is at the Autry National Center at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. Fifteen miles east of Wichita, Kansas, at the Prairie Rose Chuckwagon Supper was the Hopalong Cassidy Museum. The museum and its contents were auctioned on August 24, 2007, owing to the failure of its parent company, Wild West World.\nA \"Hoppy Museum\" consisting of a collection of products endorsed by William Boyd is located at Scott's 10th Street Antique Mall in Cambridge, Ohio.Topper's saddle is on display at Twin Cities South Trailers, a horse trailer dealership in Pilot Point Texas.\n\n\n== US Post ==\nIn 2009 the US Postal Services selected Cassidy as one of the characters featured on a series of stamps depicting early TV characters.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nOn June 16, 2009, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment released the Hopalong Cassidy Ultimate Collector's Edition, which included all 66 theatrical films on 14 DVDs, packed into a facsimile Hopalong Cassidy tin lunchbox.\nOn June 7, 2011, Timeless Media Group released Hopalong Cassidy: The Complete Television Series on DVD in Region 1.  The 6-disc set features all 52 episodes of the series restored and remastered.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCallaway Went Thataway\u20141951 film spoof of the Hopalong Cassidy craze\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCaro, Joseph, Collector's Guide to Hopalong Cassidy Memorabilia (1991, out of print)\nCaro, Joseph, Hopalong Cassidy Collectibles.

        "wiki": "McAdams is a neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas, United States. A mixed industrial and residential area northeast of Downtown Wichita, it is a historical center of the city\u2019s African American community.\n\n\n== History ==\nDespite prevalent racism and segregation in the early decades of Wichita history, an active African American community and business district developed northwest of the Old Sedgwick County Courthouse in what is today Midtown. Black men worked as construction workers, mechanics, railroad workers, and in the city\u2019s packinghouses.  By the 1920s, the neighborhood supported multiple churches, public schools, and fraternal organizations.  By the 1940s, the community had relocated several blocks northeast, specifically to the area north of Murdock Street and east of Washington Avenue i.e. present-day McAdams.The intersection of 9th Street and Cleveland Street became the commercial hub of the local black community. By the late 1940s, it was the site of a grocery store, drug store, and the Dunbar Theater. Built in 1941, the theater was named after poet Paul Laurence Dunbar and, until 1963, the only theater available to the city\u2019s African Americans.  Through the 1950s, it anchored a bustling area of retail stores, hair salons, and cafes. In 1966, the city renamed McKinley Park, located at the north end of the neighborhood, as McAdams Park after Emerson McAdams, a former city policeman and park director.Over the following decades, the neighborhood deteriorated with many businesses closing and residential housing falling into disrepair. In the early 1970s, the city government conducted generalized planning for urban renewal in McAdams, focusing on the industrial corridor that had developed along its western edge.  In the early 2000s, community activists began working with the city government to reinvest in the neighborhood and improve quality of life, leading to the creation of formal revitalization plan in 2003.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMcAdams is located at 37\u00b042\u203217\u2033N 97\u00b019\u203224\u2033W (37.704722, -97.323333) at an elevation of 1,304 feet (397 m). 13th Street North forms its northern boundary, Hydraulic Avenue and Interstate 135 its eastern boundary, Central Avenue its southern boundary, and Mosley Street its western boundary.  McAdams borders the Power neighborhood to the northeast; Minnesota Fats, Northeast Central, A. Price Woodard, and Murdock to the east; and New Salem to the southeast.  The Hyde (also known as Kellogg School) lies to the south, Downtown Wichita to the southwest, and Midtown to the west.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFor the purposes of representation on the Wichita City Council, most of McAdams lies within Council District 1. The small portion of the neighborhood west of Washington Avenue is in Council District 6.For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, McAdams is located in the 29th district of the Kansas Senate and the 84th and 103rd districts of the Kansas House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWichita Public Schools operates two facilities in the neighborhood:\nDunbar Support Center\nL\u2019Ouverture Technology Magnet Elementary School\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nThe city government's Park and Recreation Department manages two parks in the neighborhood:  McAdams Park and Paul Laurence Dunbar Park. Occupying 57.46 acres (23.25 ha) west of Interstate 135 between 13th Street and 17th Street, McAdams Park includes an assembly area for performances, biking and hiking trails, baseball diamonds, basketball courts, a concession stand, a football field, a playground, a recreation center, a swimming pool, tennis courts, tetherball courts, and volleyball courts. Paul Laurence Dunbar Park, located at Indiana and 11th Street, is a small, 0.30-acre (0.12 ha) neighborhood park which includes a playground.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nDunbar Theatre\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nMosley is the main north-south street in McAdams. 13th Street and Murdock Street are the primary east-west streets. Other arterial roads include Central Avenue, which runs east-west along the southern edge of the neighborhood, and 17th Street, which runs east-west along the northern edge of the neighborhood.  Interstate 135 runs generally north-south through the eastern part of the neighborhood, accessible via interchanges at Central, Murdock, and 13th Street.Wichita Transit offers bus service in McAdams on its 25, 27, and 28 routes.BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad operate freight rail lines which run north-south two blocks west of McAdams, parallel to Mosley Street.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, also known and branded as NCAA March Madness, is a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college basketball teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to determine the national championship. The tournament was created in 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and was the idea of Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. Played mostly during March, it has become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States.It has become extremely common in popular culture to predict the outcomes of each game, even among non-sports fans; it is estimated that tens of millions of Americans participate in a bracket pool contest every year. Mainstream media outlets such as ESPN, CBS Sports and Fox Sports host tournaments online where contestants can enter for free. Also, there are many sites that cater to corporate marketing and public relations to get in on the excitement such as BigTourney.com. Employers have also noticed a change in the behavior of employees during this time: they have seen an increase in the number of sick days used, extended lunch breaks and even the rescheduling of conference calls to allow for more tournament watching. There are also many handicappers and pundits which offer advice for winning their own bracket.The tournament teams include champions from 32 Division I conferences (which receive automatic bids), and 36 teams which are awarded at-large berths. These \"at-large\" teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee, then announced in a nationally televised event on the Sunday preceding the \"First Four\" play-in games, currently held in Dayton, Ohio, and dubbed Selection Sunday. The 68 teams are divided into four regions and organized into a single-elimination \"bracket\", which pre-determines, when a team wins a game, which team it will face next. Each team is \"seeded\", or ranked, within its region from 1 to 16. After the First Four, the tournament occurs during the course of three weekends, at pre-selected neutral sites across the United States. Teams, seeded by rank, proceed through a single-game elimination bracket beginning with a \"first four\" consisting of 8 low-seeded teams playing in 4 games for a position in the first round the Tuesday and Wednesday before the first round begins, a first round consisting of 64 teams playing in 32 games over the course of a week, the \"Sweet Sixteen\" and \"Elite Eight\" rounds the next week and weekend, respectively, and \u2013 for the last weekend of the tournament \u2013 the \"Final Four\" round. The Final Four is usually played during the first weekend of April. These four teams, one from each region (East, South, Midwest, and West), compete in a preselected location for the national championship.\nThe tournament has been at least partially televised on network television since 1969. Currently, the games are broadcast by CBS, TBS, TNT, and truTV under the trade-name NCAA March Madness. \nThese networks paid the NCAA to broadcast the games in 2011. The contract was for 14 years and they paid $10,800 million. However, in 2018 that contract was extended for another seven years making it valid through the year 2032. The average payment over the years comes out to be $891 million annually.\nSince 2011, all games are available for viewing nationwide and internationally. As television coverage has grown, so too has the tournament's popularity. Currently, millions of Americans fill out a bracket, attempting to correctly predict the outcome of 63 games of the tournament (not including the First Four games).\nWith 11 national titles, UCLA has the record for the most NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships; John Wooden coached UCLA to 10 of its 11 titles. The University of Kentucky (UK) is second, with eight national titles. The University of North Carolina is third, with six national titles, and Duke University and Indiana University are tied for fourth with five national titles. The University of Connecticut (UConn) is sixth with four national titles. The University of Kansas (KU) & Villanova University are tied for seventh with three national titles. The University of Cincinnati, the University of Florida, University of Louisville, Michigan State University, North Carolina State, Oklahoma State, and the University of San Francisco all have two national titles.  The tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1988, and to 68 in 2011.\nBoth 2020 men's and women's tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Current tournament format ==\n\nThe NCAA has changed the tournament format several times since its inception, most often being an increase of the number of teams. This section describes the tournament as it has operated since 2011.\n\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nA total of 68 teams qualify for the tournament played during March and April. Thirty-two teams earn automatic bids as their respective conference champions. Of the 32 Division I \"all-sports\" conferences (defined as those that sponsor men's and women's basketball), all 32 currently hold championship tournaments to determine which team receives the automatic qualification. The Ivy League was the last Division I conference that did not conduct a tournament; through the 2015\u201316 season, it awarded its tournament berth to the regular-season champion. If two or more Ivies shared a regular-season championship, a one-game playoff (or series of such playoffs) was used to decide the tournament participant. Since 2017, the league conducts their own postseason tournament.The remaining 36 tournament slots are granted to at-large bids, which are determined by the Selection Committee in a nationally televised event on the Sunday preceding the First Four play-in tournament and dubbed Selection Sunday by the media and fans, by a group primarily of conference commissioners and school athletic directors who are appointed into service by the NCAA. The committee also determines where all sixty-eight teams are seeded and placed in the bracket.\n\n\n=== Regions ===\nThe tournament is divided into four regions and each region has at least sixteen teams, but four additional teams are added per the decision of the Selection Committee. (See: First Four, below.) The committee is charged with making each of the four regions as close as possible in overall quality of teams from wherever they come from.\nThe names of the regions vary from year to year, and are broadly geographic (such as \"East\", \"South\", \"Midwest\" & \"West\"). From 1957 to 1984, the \"Mideast\", roughly corresponding to the Southeastern region of the United States, designation was used. From 1985 to 1997, the Mideast region was known as \"Southeast\" and again changed to \"South\" starting from 1998. The selected names roughly correspond to the location of the four cities hosting the regional finals. From 2004 to 2006, the regions were named after their host cities, e.g. the Phoenix Regional in 2004, the Chicago Regional in 2005, and the Minneapolis Regional in 2006, but reverted to the traditional geographic designations beginning in 2007. For example, during 2012, the regions were named South (Atlanta, Georgia), East (Boston, Massachusetts), Midwest (St. Louis, Missouri), and West (Phoenix, Arizona).\n\n\n==== Seeding and bracket ====\n\nThe selection committee ranks the whole field of 68 teams from 1 to 68. (It did not make this information public until 2012.) The committee then divides the teams amongst the regions. The top four teams will be distributed among the four regions, and each will receive a No. 1 seed within that region. The next four ranked teams will then be distributed among the four regions, each receiving a No. 2 seed in their region, and the process continues down the line, with some exceptions (as is explained below). Carried to its logical conclusion, this would give each region seventeen teams\u2014seeded from No. 1 to No. 17\u2014but, each region has only sixteen teams (from No. 1 to No. 16). As can be seen below, the actual seeding depends on (among other factors) the rankings of the eight teams that the committee selects for the \"First Four\" opening round (see the next paragraph and the \"First Four\" section below).\nThe selection committee is also instructed to place teams so that whenever possible, teams from the same conference cannot meet until the regional finals. Additionally, it is also instructed to avoid any possible rematches of regular-season or previous year's tournament games during the First and Second rounds. Further restrictions are listed in the Venues section below. To comply with these other requirements, the selection committee may move one or several teams up or down one seed from their respective original seed line. Thus, for example, the 40th overall ranked team, originally slated to be a No. 10 seed within a particular region, may instead be moved up to a No. 9 seed or moved down to a No. 11 seed. In addition, the rankings of the eight teams selected for the \"First Four\" play-in round will likewise affect the final seedlings.\nThe bracket is thus established, and during the semifinals, the champion of the top-ranked number 1 seed's region will play against the champion of the fourth-ranked number 1 seed's region, and the champion of the second-ranked number 1 seed's region will play against the champion of the third-ranked number 1 seed's region.\n\n\n==== Venues ====\nIn the men's tournament, all sites are nominally neutral; teams are prohibited from playing tournament games on their home courts prior to the Final Four (though in some cases, a team may be fortunate enough to play in or near its home state or city). By current NCAA rules, any court on which a team hosts more than three regular-season games (in other words, not including conference tournament games) is considered a \"home court\". The exception to this rule is the University of Dayton, which would be allowed to play a game in the \"First Four\" round in their home arena as they did in 2015.\nHowever, while a team can be moved to a different region if its home court is being used during any of the first two weeks of the tournament, the Final Four venue is determined years in advance, and cannot be changed regardless of participants. For this reason a team could potentially play in a Final Four on its home court, though this is unlikely, since the Final Four is staged at venues larger than most college basketball arenas. (The most recent team to play the Final Four in its home city was Butler during 2010; its home court then seated only 10,000, as opposed to the 70,000-plus capacity of Lucas Oil Stadium, the Final Four venue.)\n\n\n=== Rounds ===\nThe tournament consists of several rounds. They are currently named, in order of first to last:\n\nThe First Four\nThe First Round (the Round of 64)\nThe Second Round (the Round of 32)\nThe Regional Semi-finals (participating teams are known popularly as the \"Sweet Sixteen\")\nThe Regional Finals (participating teams are known commonly as the \"Elite Eight\")\nThe National Semi-finals (participating teams are referred to officially as the \"Final Four\")\nThe National ChampionshipThe tournament is single-elimination, which increases the chance of an underdog and lower-seeded \"Cinderella team\" advancing to subsequent rounds. Although these lower-ranked teams are forced to play stronger teams, they need only one win to advance (instead of needing to win a majority of games in a series, as in professional basketball).\n\n\n==== First Four ====\n\nFirst held during 2011, the First Four are games between the four lowest-ranked at-large teams and the four lowest-ranked automatic-bid (conference-champion) teams.\n\nFirst Four At-large seeds\nNote: Each year, the four lowest-ranked automatic-bid teams compete to receive No. 16 seeds, while the four lowest-ranked at-large teams compete to be No. 11 seeds. From 2011 through 2014, the at-large teams competed in the First-Four games for a No. 11, 12, 13, or 14 seed in one of the regions. The table below shows the years in which each of those four seeds were claimed by one of the two at-large winners.\n\n\n==== First and Second Rounds ====\nDuring the First Round (the Round of 64), the No. 1 seed plays the No. 16 seed in all regions; the No. 2 team plays the No. 15, and so on. The effect of this seeding structure ensures that the better a team is ranked (and therefore seeded), the worse-ranked (and presumably weaker) their opponents will be. Sixteen first-round games are played on the Thursday following the \"First Four\" round. The remaining sixteen first-round games are played Friday. At this point the contestants are reduced to 32 teams.\nThe Second Round (the Round of 32) is played on Saturday and Sunday immediately after the first round. The second round consists of Thursday's winners playing in eight games on Saturday, followed by Friday's winners playing in the remaining eight second-round games on Sunday. Thus, after the first weekend, 16 teams remain, commonly known as the \"Sweet Sixteen.\"\n\n\n==== Regional semifinals and finals ====\nThe teams that are still competing after the first weekend advance to the regional semifinals (the Sweet Sixteen) and finals (the Elite Eight), which are played during the second weekend of the tournament (again, the games are split into Thursday/Saturday and Friday/Sunday). Unlike hockey, teams are not re-seeded where the number one seed in each conference would play the lowest ranked. Four regional semi-final games are played Thursday and four are played Friday. After Friday's games, 8 teams (the Elite Eight) remain. Saturday features two regional final games matching Thursday's winners and Sunday's two final games match Friday's winners. After the second weekend of the tournament, the four regional champions are the \"Final Four.\"\n\n\n==== Final Four ====\n\nThe winners of each region advance to the Final Four, where the national semifinals are played on Saturday and the national championship is played on Monday. As is noted above, which regional champion will play which, and in which semifinal they play, is determined by the overall rankings of the four No. 1 seeds in the original bracket, not on the ranks of the eventual Final Four teams themselves.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== Titles by year ===\n\n\n=== Titles by school ===\n\nThe following is a list of all schools that have won at least one NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, along with the year(s) in which they won their championship(s).\n* 2013 title vacated by NCAA.\n\n\n== Tournament history ==\n\n\n=== Mid-major teams ===\nMid-major teams\u2014which are defined as teams from the America East Conference (America East), Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN), Big Sky Conference (Big Sky), Big South Conference (Big South), Big West Conference (Big West), Colonial Athletic Conference (CAA), Conference USA (C-USA), Horizon League (Horizon), Ivy League (Ivy), Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), Mid-American Conference (MAC), Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), Mountain West Conference (MW), Northeast Conference (NEC), Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), Patriot League (Patriot), Southern Conference (SoCon), Southland Conference (Southland), Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), Summit League (Summit), Sun Belt Conference (Sun Belt), West Coast Conference (WCC), and the Western Athletic Conference (WAC)\u2014have experienced success in the tournament at various times.The last time, as of 2020, a mid-major team won the National Championship was 1990 when UNLV won with a 103\u201373 win over Duke, since UNLV was then a member of the Big West and since 1999 has been a member of the MW; the Big West was not then considered a power conference, nor is the MW today. However, during the tenure of UNLV's coach at the time, Jerry Tarkanian, the Runnin' Rebels were widely viewed as a major program despite their conference affiliation (a situation similar to that of Gonzaga in the 2010s). The last time, as of 2020, an independent mid-major team won the National Championship was 1977 when Marquette won with a 67\u201359 win over North Carolina. However, at the time, a significant minority of NCAA Division I schools were still independents, with several of these, including Marquette, being traditional basketball powers. (Marquette is now a member of the Big East Conference, the one non-football league that is universally considered a major basketball conference.) The last time, as of 2020, a mid-major team from a small media market (defined as a market out of the top 25 television markets in the United States in 2019) won the National Championship was arguably 1962 when Cincinnati, then in the MVC, won 71\u201359 over Ohio State of the Big Ten, since Cincinnati's TV market is listed 35th in the nation as of 2020. However, there was much less of a division between \"major\" and \"mid-major\" conferences in 1962, and the MVC was generally seen in that day as a major basketball conference.\nThe last time the Final Four was composed, as of 2020, of at least 75% mid-major teams (3/4), i.e. excluding all present-day major conferences or their predecessors, was 1979, where Indiana State, then as now of the Missouri Valley Conference (which had lost several of its most prominent programs, among them Cincinnati, earlier in the decade); Penn, then as now in the Ivy League; and DePaul, then an independent, participated in the Final Four, only to see Indiana State lose to Michigan State. The last time, as of 2020, the Final Four has been composed of at least 50% mid-major teams (2/4) was 2011, when VCU, then of the Colonial Athletic Association, and Butler, then of the Horizon League, participated in the Final Four, only to see Butler lose to Connecticut. Two of the three most recent Final Fours have involved a single \"mid-major\" team by the definition used here\u2014the 2017 and 2018 tournaments, in which Gonzaga and Loyola\u2013Chicago were respectively involved (although by 2017 Gonzaga, which has appeared in every NCAA tournament in the 21st century, was generally considered a major program despite its membership in the mid-major WCC). To date, as of 2020, no Final Four has been composed of 100% mid-major teams (4/4), therefore guaranteeing a mid-major team winning the National Championship.\nArguably the tournament with the most mid-major success was the 1970 tournament, where the Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four, and National Championship Game had 63% representation of mid-major teams in the Sweet 16 (10/16), 75% representation in the Elite 8 (6/8), 75% representation in the Final 4 (3/4), and 50% representation in the National Championship Game (1/2). Jacksonville lost to UCLA in the National Championship, with New Mexico State defeating St. Bonaventure for third place.\nBelow is a table that shows the performance of mid-major teams from the Sweet Sixteen round to the National Championship Game from 1939\u2014the tournament's first year\u2014to the present day.\n\nNotesThe first column is a list of every mid-major conference. For the conferences that have predecessor names, a footnote (below the table) lists those names and years. Opposite each conference's name are the schools that have appeared in the tournament from the Sweet Sixteen onwards when the school was a member of the conference or a predecessor conference.\nSome of the conferences that are now considered mid-majors were regarded as major conferences in the past. For example:\nThe Missouri Valley Conference was considered a major basketball conference until many of its most prominent members left in the mid-1970s (before Indiana State's 1979 run to the title game).\nConference USA was considered a major conference at its formation in 1995. It arguably became a mid-major in 2005, when several of its more prominent teams left for the Big East Conference, and unquestionably became a mid-major during the early-2010s realignment cycle.\nThe WAC was considered a major conference until 1999, when 8 of its 16 members left to form the Mountain West Conference.\nThe MW was considered a major basketball conference until 2011, when two of its most prominent basketball programs (BYU and Utah) left for other conferences (West Coast Conference and Pac-12, respectively).\nAs alluded to above, certain programs that were members of \"mid-major\" conferences during deep tournament runs are nonetheless widely viewed as having been major programs at that time. The same applies to many programs that were independent before the 1980s. Examples include (but are not limited to) San Francisco in the 1950s, Marquette in the 1970s, UNLV in the last part of the 20th century, and Gonzaga today.\n\n\n==== Defunct conferences and independents ====\nThis table shows mid-major teams that saw success in the tournament from now-defunct conferences or were independents.\nThe Metro Conference, which operated from 1975 to 1995, is not listed here because it was considered a major basketball conference throughout its history. Most notably, Louisville, which was a member for the league's entire existence, won both of its NCAA-recognized titles (1980, 1986) while in the Metro.\n\n\n=== Tournament droughts ===\nList of schools with the longest time between NCAA tournament appearances (minimum 20-year drought):\n\nThrough 2018, four schools that were considered \"major college\" by the Associated Press when it published its first college basketball rankings in 1948, and have been continuously in the AP's \"major\" classification, have yet to reach the national tournament. While the NCAA did not split into divisions until 1956 (university and college), the AP has distinguished \"major colleges\" from \"small colleges\" throughout the history of its basketball rankings.\n\n\n== Evolution of the tournament ==\nThe NCAA tournament has changed its format many times over the years, many of which are listed below.\n\n\n=== Expansion of field ===\nThe NCAA tournament field has expanded a number of times throughout its history.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2010 tournament, there was speculation about increasing the tournament size to as many as 128 teams. On April 1, the NCAA announced that it was looking at expanding to 96 teams for 2011. On April 22, the NCAA announced a new television contract with CBS/Turner that expanded the field to 68 teams.\nFrom 2011 to 2015, the round of 64 was deemed to be the second round; beginning in 2016, the round of 64 was again deemed to be the first round.\n\n\n=== Seeding history and statistics ===\nThe process of seeding was first used in 1978 for automatically qualified (Q) and at-large (L) teams respectively, and then for all teams within their respective region in 1979. Starting in 2004, the NCAA began releasing full seeding numbers making known the overall #1 seed.\n\n\n==== No. 1 seeds by year and region ====\nWhen seeding, the NCAA has used the following names for the four regions with the exception of 2004 to 2006 when they were named after host cities:\n\nEast\nWest\nMidwest (\"Southwest\" in 2011)\nSouth (1998\u20132010 and 2012\u2013present, \"Mideast\" 1957\u20131984, \"Southeast\" 1985\u20131999 and 2011)* Vacated.Bold denotes team also won tournament.\u2020 Overall #1 Seed starting in 2004.To date, only Kentucky and Virginia have had a #1 seed in each of the four regions\n\n\n==== Number of #1 seeds by school ====\nLast updated through 2018 tournament.* Vacated appearances excluded (see #1 seeds by year and region).\n\n\n=== Venues ===\nFor a list of all the cities and arenas that have hosted the Final Four, go to Host cities, below.\nMunicipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri, hosted the Final Four nine times, followed by the third Madison Square Garden in New York City, which hosted seven times, and Louisville's Freedom Hall, which hosted six times. Additionally, Indianapolis has hosted the Final Four seven times, across three venues.\n\n\n==== Stadium size and domes ====\nFrom 1997 to 2013, the NCAA required that all Final Four sessions take place in domed stadiums with a minimum capacity of 40,000, usually having only half of the dome in use. The Metrodome in Minneapolis, which usually hosted baseball and football, had one of the long ends of the court along the first baseline with temporary stands surrounding the court so that much of the outfield is isolated from the action. The same was true of football stadiums like the Alamodome in San Antonio and the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. The last NBA arena to host the Final Four was the Meadowlands Arena, then known as Continental Airlines Arena, in 1996. As of 2009, the minimum was increased to 70,000, by adding additional seating on the floor of the dome, and raising the court on a platform three feet above the dome's floor, which is usually crowned for football, like the setup at Ford Field in Detroit which hosted 2009 Final Four.\nIn September 2012, the NCAA began preliminary discussions on the possibility of returning occasional Final Fours to basketball-specific arenas in major metropolitan areas. According to ESPN.com writer Andy Katz, when Mark Lewis was hired as NCAA executive vice president for championships during 2012, \"he took out a United States map and saw that both coasts are largely left off from hosting the Final Four.\" Lewis added in an interview with Katz,\n\nI don't know where this will lead, if anywhere, but the right thing is to sit down and have these conversations and see if we want our championship in more than eight cities or do we like playing exclusively in domes. None of the cities where we play our championship is named New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago or Miami. We don't play on a campus. We play in professional football arenas.\n\nUnder then-current criteria, only eleven stadiums, all but two of which are current NFL venues, could be considered as Final Four locations:\nAT&T Stadium, Arlington (opened in 2009)\nAT&T Stadium, originally known as Cowboys Stadium, holds the world record basketball attendance when 108,713 attended the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.\nAllegiant Stadium, Las Vegas (opening in 2020)\nThe Dome at America's Center, St. Louis (opened in 1995)\nFord Field, Detroit (opened in 2002)\nLucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis (opened in 2008)\nMercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta (opened in 2017)\nreplaced the Georgia Dome, operational August 1992 to March 2017\nMercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans (opened in 1975)\nNRG Stadium, Houston (opened in 2002)\nState Farm Stadium, Glendale (opened in 2007)\nSoFi Stadium\nU.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis (opened in 2016)\nreplaced the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, operational April 1982 to January 2014\nAlamodome, San Antonio (opened in 1990)Two domed stadiums that have hosted past Final Fours\u2014the Alamodome (1998, 2004, 2008, 2018) and Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida (1999)\u2014were considered too small to be eligible to host, despite the Alamodome being a college football stadium and having a permanent seating capacity of 65,000. The basketball setup at the Alamodome prior to 2018 used only half of the stadium and had a capacity of 39,500. This was changed for the 2018 Final Four to place a raised court at the center of the stadium as has been done with other football facilities.The first instance of a domed stadium being used for an NCAA Tournament Final Four was the Houston Astrodome in 1971, but the Final Four would not return to a dome until 1982 when the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans hosted the event for the first time.\n\nOn June 12, 2013, Katz reported that the NCAA had changed its policy. In July 2013, the NCAA had a portal available on its website for venues to make Final Four proposals in the 2017\u20132020 period, and there were no restrictions on proposals based on venue size. Also, the NCAA decided that future regionals will no longer be held in domes. In Katz' report, Lewis indicated that the use of domes for regionals was intended as a dry run for future Final Four venues, but this particular policy was no longer necessary because all of the Final Four sites from 2014 to 2016 had already hosted regionals. At least one other report indicated that the new policy would still allow a completely new domed stadium, or an existing dome that has never hosted a Final Four (such as State Farm Stadium), to receive a regional if it is awarded a future Final Four. In November 2014, reflecting the new policy's effect, the NCAA announced that what is now State Farm Stadium would host the Final Four in 2017.\n\n\n=== Other changes ===\n\n\n==== Bids per conferences ====\nPrior to 1975, only one team per conference could be in the NCAA tournament. However, after several highly ranked teams in the country were denied entrance into the tournament (e.g., South Carolina, which was 14\u20130 in ACC regular season play during 1970 but lost in the ACC tournament; Southern Cal, which was ranked #2 in the nation during 1971; and Maryland, which was ranked #3 in the nation in 1974 but lost the ACC tournament championship game to eventual national champion North Carolina State), the NCAA began to place at-large teams in the tournament, instead of just conference champions. At times during the pre-at-large era, the NIT tournament competed for prestige with the NCAA tournament. However, in the 1950s the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments. But when 8th ranked Marquette declined its invitation in 1970 after coach Al McGuire complained about the Warriors' regional placement and instead went to the NIT (which it won), the NCAA changed the rule to forbid a team that declines an NCAA Tournament bid from participating in any post-season tournament. Since then, the NCAA tournament has clearly been the major one, with conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it.\n\n\n==== Consolation games ====\nA third-place game was held from 1946 to 1981. Additionally, when the tournament was first held in 1939 with only two regionals (East and West), the West held a third-place game, but the East did not. The East began holding its own third-place game in 1941, and from then on every regional held a third-place game through the 1975 tournament.\n\n\n==== Play-In games ====\n\nBeginning in 2001, the field was expanded from 64 to 65 teams, adding to the tournament what was informally known as the \"play-in game.\" This was in response to the creation of the Mountain West Conference during 1999. Originally, the winner of the Mountain West's tournament did not receive an automatic bid, and doing so would mean the elimination of one of the at-large bids. As an alternative to eliminating an at-large bid, the NCAA expanded the tournament to 65 teams. The #64 and #65 seeds were seeded in a regional bracket as the 16a/16b seeds, and then played the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Opening Round Game (the \"play-in game\") on the Tuesday preceding the first weekend of the tournament. This game was always played at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio.\nDuring 2011, the tournament expanded to 68 teams. Four \"play-in\" games are now played, officially known as the \"First Four\". However, the teams playing in the First Four are not automatically seeded #16; their seeding is determined by the committee on Selection Sunday. Explaining the reasoning for this format, selection committee chairman Dan Guerrero said, \"We felt if we were going to expand the field it would create better drama for the tournament if the First Four was much more exciting. They could all be on the 10 line or the 12 line or the 11 line.\"\n\n\n==== Play-In round naming ====\nFrom 1985 to 2010, the round consisting of 64 teams and 32 games was called the \"first round\", while the round consisting of 32 teams and 16 games was called the \"second round\". From 2011 to 2015, the \"First Four\" became the first round. The round after the \"First Four\", the round of 64 played on Thursday and Friday, was called the \"second round\"; the round of 32 was then called the \"third round\", consisting of games played on Saturday and Sunday. In 2016, the naming reverted to the round of 64 being the \"first round\" once again, and the round of 32 being the \"second round\".\n\n\n==== Pod system ====\nFor the 1985 to 2001 tournaments, all teams playing at a first- or second-round site fed into the same regional site. Since 2002, the tournament has used the \"pod system\" designed to limit the early-round travel of as many teams as possible. In the pod system, each of the eight first- and second-round sites is assigned two pods, where each group of four teams play each other. A host site's pods may be from different regions, and thus the winners of each pod would advance into separate regional tournaments.\nThe possible pods by seeding are:\n\nPod #1: 1v16, 8v9\nPod #2: 2v15, 7v10\nPod #3: 3v14, 6v11\nPod #4: 4v13, 5v12\n\n\n==== National Semifinal seeding ====\nSince 2004, the semi-final matches during the first day of the Final Four weekend have been determined by a procedure based upon the original seeding of the full field. From 1973 through 2003, the pitting of regional champions in the semi-finals was on a rotational basis. Prior to 1973, one semifinal matched the champions of the eastern regions, and the other matched the champions of the western regions.\n\n\n=== Other notes ===\n\n\n==== Home court advantage ====\nOn several occasions NCAA tournament teams played their games in their home arena. In 1959, Louisville played at its regular home of Freedom Hall; however, the Cardinals lost to West Virginia in the semifinals. In 1984, Kentucky defeated Illinois, 54\u201351 in the Elite Eight on its home court of Rupp Arena. In 1985, Dayton played its first-round game against Villanova (it lost 51\u201349) on its home floor. In 1986 (beating Brown before losing to Navy) and '87 (beating Georgia Southern and Western Kentucky), Syracuse played the first 2 rounds of the NCAA tournament in the Carrier Dome. Also in 1986, LSU played in Baton Rouge on its home floor for the first 2 rounds despite being an 11th seed (beating Purdue and Memphis State). In 1987, Arizona lost to UTEP on its home floor in the first round.  In 2015, Dayton played at its regular home of UD Arena, and the Flyers beat Boise State in the First Four.\nSince the inception of the modern Final Four in 1952, only once has a team played a Final Four on its actual home court\u2014Louisville in 1959. But through the 2015 tournament, three other teams have played the Final Four in their home cities, one other team has played in its metropolitan area, and six additional teams have played the Final Four in their home states through the 2015 tournament. Kentucky (1958 in Louisville), UCLA (1968 and 1972 in Los Angeles, 1975 in San Diego), and North Carolina State (1974 in Greensboro) won the national title; Louisville (1959 at its home arena, Freedom Hall); Purdue (1980 in Indianapolis) lost in the Final Four; and California (1960 in suburban San Francisco), Duke (1994 in Charlotte), Michigan State (2009 in Detroit), and Butler (2010 in Indianapolis) lost in the final.\nIn 1960, Cal had nearly as large an edge as Louisville had the previous year, only having to cross the San Francisco Bay to play in the Final Four at the Cow Palace in Daly City; the Golden Bears lost in the championship game to Ohio State. UCLA had a similar advantage in 1968 and 1972 when it advanced to the Final Four at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, not many miles from the Bruins' homecourt of Pauley Pavilion (also UCLA's home arena before the latter venue opened in 1965, and again during the 2011\u201312 season while Pauley was closed for renovations); unlike Louisville and Cal, the Bruins won the national title on both occasions. Butler lost the 2010 title 6 miles (9.7 km) from its Indianapolis campus and was regarded as the host school, as it is most times whenever the NCAA holds a tournament in Indianapolis (in the 2013 tournament, Butler's former conference, the Horizon League, was considered the host for the Midwest Regional rather than Butler).\nBefore the Final Four was established, the East and West regionals were held at separate sites, with the winners advancing to the title game. During that era, three New York City teams, all from Manhattan, played in the East Regional at Madison Square Garden\u2014frequently used as a \"big-game\" venue by each team\u2014and advanced at least to the national semifinals. NYU won the East Regional in 1945 but lost in the title game, also held at the Garden, to Oklahoma A&M. CCNY played in the East Regional in both 1947 and 1950; the Beavers lost in the 1947 East final to eventual champion Holy Cross but won the 1950 East Regional and national titles at the Garden.\nIn 1974, North Carolina State won the NCAA tournament without leaving its home state of North Carolina. The team was put in the East Region, and played its regional games at its home arena Reynolds Coliseum. NC State played the final four and national championship games at nearby Greensboro Coliseum.\nWhile not its home state, Kansas has played in the championship game in Kansas City, Missouri, only 45 minutes from the campus in Lawrence, Kansas, not just once, but four times. In 1940, 1953, and 1957 the Jayhawks lost the championship game each time at Municipal Auditorium. In 1988, playing at Kansas City's Kemper Arena, Kansas won the championship, over Big Eight\u2013rival Oklahoma. Similarly, in 2005, Illinois played in St. Louis, Missouri, where it enjoyed a noticeable homecourt advantage, yet still lost in the championship game to North Carolina.\n\n\n==== Flag controversy ====\nThe NCAA had banned the Bon Secours Wellness Arena, originally known as Bi-Lo Center, and Colonial Life Arena, originally Colonial Center, in South Carolina from hosting tournament games, despite their sizes (16,000 and 18,000 seats, respectively) because of an NAACP protest at the Bi-Lo Center during the 2002 first and second round tournament games over that state's refusal to completely remove the Confederate Battle Flag from the state capitol grounds, although it had already been relocated from atop the capitol dome to a less prominent place in 2000. Following requests by the NAACP and Black Coaches Association, the Bi-Lo Center, and the newly built Colonial Center, which was built for purposes of hosting the tournament, were banned from hosting any future tournament events. As a result of the removal of the battle flag from the South Carolina State Capitol, the NCAA lifted its ban on South Carolina hosting games in 2015, and it was able to host in 2017 due to House Bill 2 (see next section).\n\n\n==== House Bill 2 ====\nOn September 12, 2016, the NCAA stripped the State of North Carolina of hosting rights for seven upcoming college sports tournaments and championships held by the association, including early round games of the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament scheduled for the Greensboro Coliseum. The NCAA argued that House Bill 2 made it \"challenging to guarantee that host communities can help deliver [an inclusive atmosphere]\". Bon Secours Wellness Arena was able to secure the bid to be the replacement site.\n\n\n== Rituals and influence ==\n\n\n=== Cutting down the nets ===\n\nAs a tournament ritual, the winning team cuts down the nets at the end of regional championship games as well as the national championship game. Starting with the seniors, and moving down by classes, players each cut a single strand off of each net; the head coach cuts the last strand connecting the net to the hoop, claiming the net itself. An exception to the head coach cutting the last strand came in 2013, when Louisville head coach Rick Pitino gave that honor to Kevin Ware, who had suffered a catastrophic leg injury during the tournament. This tradition is credited to Everett Case, the coach of North Carolina State, who stood on his players' shoulders to accomplish the feat after the Wolfpack won the Southern Conference tournament in 1947. CBS, since 1987 and yearly to 2015, in the odd-numbered years since 2017, and TBS, since 2016, the even-numbered years, close out the tournament with \"One Shining Moment\", performed by Luther Vandross.\n\n\n=== Team awards ===\nJust as the Olympics awards gold, silver, and bronze medals for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place, respectively, the NCAA awards the National Champions a gold-plated Wooden NCAA National Championship trophy. The loser of the championship game receives a silver-plated National Runner-Up trophy for second place. Since 2006, all four Final Four teams receive a bronze plated NCAA Regional Championship trophy; prior to 2006, only the teams who did not make the title game received bronze plated trophies for being a semifinalist.\nThe champions also receive a commemorative gold championship ring, and the other three Final Four teams receive Final Four rings.\nThe National Association of Basketball Coaches also presents a more elaborate marble/crystal trophy to the winning team. Ostensibly, this award is given for taking the top position in the NABC's end-of-season poll, but this is invariably the same as the NCAA championship game winner. In 2005, Siemens AG acquired naming rights to the NABC trophy, which is now called the Siemens Trophy. Formerly, the NABC trophy was presented right after the standard NCAA championship trophy, but this caused some confusion. Since 2006, the Siemens/NABC Trophy has been presented separately at a press conference the day after the game.\n\n\n=== Most Outstanding Player ===\nAfter the championship trophy is awarded, one player is selected and then awarded the Most Outstanding Player award (which almost always comes from the championship team). It is not intended to be the same as a Most Valuable Player award although it is sometimes informally referred to as such.\n\n\n=== Influence on the NBA draft ===\nBecause the National Basketball Association Draft takes place just three months after the NCAA tournament, NBA executives have to decide how players' performances in a maximum of seven games, from the First Four to the championship game, should affect their draft decisions. A 2012 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research explores how the March tournament affects the way that professional teams behave in the June draft. The study is based on data from 1997 to 2010 that looks at how college tournament standouts performed at the NBA level.The researchers determined that a player who outperforms his regular season averages or who is on a team that wins more games than its seed would indicate will be drafted higher than he otherwise would have been. At the same time, the study indicated that professional teams don't take college tournament performance into consideration as much as they should, as success in the tournament correlates with elite professional accomplishment, particularly top-level success, where a player makes the NBA All-Star Team three or more times. \"If anything, NBA teams undervalue the signal provided by unexpected performance in the NCAA March Madness tournament as a predictor of future NBA success.\"\n\n\n== Television coverage and revenues ==\n\n\n=== Current television contracts ===\n\nSince 2010, the NCAA has had a joint contract with CBS and Turner Broadcasting. The coverage of the tournament is split between CBS, TNT, TBS, and truTV.Broadcasters from CBS, TBS, and TNT's sports coverage are shared across all four networks, with CBS' college basketball teams supplemented with Turner's NBA teams, while studio segments take place at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and Turner's studios in Atlanta. In the New York-based studio shows, CBS' Greg Gumbel and Clark Kellogg are joined by Ernie Johnson, Jr., Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley of TNT's Inside the NBA while Seth Davis of CBS assists with Casey Stern and various NBA TV personalities. While two of Turner's NBA voices, Kevin Harlan and Ian Eagle, are already employed by CBS in other capacities, they also lend analysts Reggie Miller, Chris Webber, Grant Hill, and Steve Smith and secondary play-by-play man Brian Anderson to CBS. In turn, CBS announcers Jim Nantz, Brad Nessler, Spero Dedes, Andrew Catalon, and Carter Blackburn appear on Turner network broadcasts along with analysts Jim Spanarkel, Bill Raftery, and Dan Bonner.\nThe current contract runs through 2024 and, for the first time in history, provides for the nationwide broadcast each year of all games of the tournament. All First Four games air on truTV. A featured first- or second-round game in each time \"window\" is broadcast on CBS, while all other games are shown either on TBS, TNT or truTV. The regional semifinals, better known as the Sweet Sixteen, are split between CBS and TBS. CBS had the exclusive rights to the regional finals, also known as the Elite Eight, through 2014. That exclusivity extended to the entire Final Four as well, but after the 2013 tournament Turner Sports elected to exercise a contractual option for 2014 and 2015 giving TBS broadcast rights to the national semifinal matchups. CBS kept its national championship game rights.Since 2015, CBS and TBS split coverage of the Elite Eight. Since 2016 CBS and TBS alternate coverage of the Final Four and national championship game, with TBS getting the final two rounds in even-numbered years, and CBS getting the games in odd-numbered years. March Madness On Demand would remain unchanged, although Turner was allowed to develop their own service.The CBS broadcast provides the NCAA with over $500 million annually, and makes up over 90% of the NCAA's annual revenue. The revenues from the multibillion-dollar television contract are divided among the Division I basketball playing schools and conferences as follows:\n1/6 of the money goes directly to the schools based on how many sports they play (one \"share\" for each sport starting with 14, which is the minimum needed for Division I membership).\n1/3 of the money goes directly to the schools based on how many scholarships they give out (one share for each of the first 50, two for each of the next 50, ten for each of the next 50, and 20 for each scholarship above 150).\n1/2 of the money goes to the conferences based on how well they did in the six previous men's basketball tournaments (counting each year separately, one share for each team getting in, and one share for each win except in the Final Four and, prior to the 2008 tournament, the Play-in game). In 2007, based on the 2001 through 2006 tournaments, the Big East received over $14.85 million, while the eight conferences that did not win a first-round game in those six years received slightly more than $1 million each. Most conferences distribute most of the revenue evenly to its member institutions, regardless of performance.The Division I Men's Basketball tournament is the only NCAA championship tournament where the NCAA does not keep the profits.\n\n\n=== History of television coverage ===\nCBS has been the major partner of the NCAA in televising the tournament since 1982, but there have been many changes in coverage since the tournament was first broadcast in 1969.\n\n\n==== Early broadcast coverage ====\nFrom 1969 to 1981, the NCAA tournament aired on NBC, but not all games were televised. The early rounds, in particular, were not always seen on TV.\nIn 1982, CBS obtained broadcast television rights to the NCAA tournament.\n\n\n==== ESPN & CBS share coverage ====\nIn 1980, ESPN began showing the opening rounds of the tournament. This was the network's first contract signed with the NCAA for a major sport, and helped to establish ESPN's following among college basketball fans. ESPN showed six first-round games on Thursday and again on Friday, with CBS, from 1982 to 1990, then picking up a seventh game at 11:30 pm ET. Thus, 14 of 32 first-round games were televised. ESPN also re-ran games overnight. At the time, there was only one ESPN network, with no ability to split its signal regionally, so ESPN showed only the most competitive games. During the 1980s, the tournament's popularity on television soared.\n\n\n==== CBS takes over ====\nHowever, ESPN became a victim of its own success, as CBS was awarded the rights to cover all games of the NCAA tournament, starting in 1991. Only with the introduction of the so-called \"play-in\" game (between the 64 seed and the 65 seed) in the 2000s, did ESPN get back in the game (and actually, the first time this \"play-in\" game was played in 2001, the game was aired on The National Network, using CBS graphics and announcers, as both CBS and TNN were both owned by Viacom at the time.Through 2010, CBS broadcast the remaining 63 games of the NCAA tournament proper. Most areas saw only eight of 32 first-round games, seven of 16 second-round games, and four of eight regional semifinal games (out of the possible 56 games during these rounds; there would be some exceptions to this rule in the 2000s). Coverage preempted regular programming on the network, except during a 2-hour window from about 5 ET until 7 ET when the local affiliates could show programming. The CBS format resulted in far fewer hours of first-round coverage than under the old ESPN format but allowed the games to reach a much larger audience than ESPN was able to reach.During this period of near-exclusivity by CBS, the network provided to its local affiliates three types of feeds from each venue: constant feed, swing feed, and flex feed. Constant feeds remained primarily on a given game, and were used primarily by stations with a clear local interest in a particular game. Despite its name, a constant feed occasionally veered away to other games for brief updates (as is typical in most American sports coverage), but coverage generally remained with the initial game. A swing feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural interest to the locality, such as teams from local conferences, but may leave that game to go to other games that during their progress become close matches. On a flex feed, coverage bounced around from one venue to another, depending on action at the various games in progress. If one game was a blowout, coverage could switch to a more competitive game. A flex feed was provided when there were no games with a significant natural local interest for the stations carrying them, which allowed the flex game to be the best game in progress. Station feeds were planned in advance and stations had the option of requesting either constant or flex feed for various games.\n\n\n==== Viewing options emerge ====\nIn 1999, DirecTV began broadcasting all games otherwise not shown on local television with its Mega March Madness premium package. The DirecTV system used the subscriber's ZIP code to black out games which could be seen on broadcast television. Prior to that, all games were available on C-Band satellite and were picked up by sports bars.\nIn 2003, CBS struck a deal with Yahoo! to offer live streaming of the first three rounds of games under its Yahoo! Platinum service, for $16.95 a month. In 2004, CBS began selling viewers access to March Madness On Demand, which provided games not otherwise shown on broadcast television; the service was free for AOL subscribers. In 2006, March Madness On Demand was made free, and continued to be so to online users through the 2011 tournament. For 2012, it once again became a pay service, with a single payment of $3.99 providing access to all 67 tournament games. In 2013, the service, now renamed March Madness Live, was again made free, but uses Turner's rights and infrastructure for TV Everywhere, which requires sign-in though the password of a customer's cable or satellite provider to watch games, both via PC/Mac and mobile devices. Those that do not have a cable or satellite service or one not participating in Turner's TV Everywhere are restricted to games carried on the CBS national feed and three hours (originally four) of other games without sign-in, or coverage via Westwood One's radio coverage. Effective with the 2018 tournament, the national semifinals and final are under TV Everywhere restrictions if they are aired by Turner networks; before then, those particular games were not subject to said restrictions.\nIn addition, CBS Sports Network (formerly CBS College Sports Network) had broadcast two \"late early\" games that would not otherwise be broadcast nationally. These were the second games in the daytime session in the Pacific Time Zone, to avoid starting games before 10 AM. These games are also available via March Madness Live and on CBS affiliates in the market areas of the team playing. In other markets, newscasts, local programming or preempted CBS morning programming are aired. CBSSN is scheduled to continue broadcasting the official pregame and postgame shows and press conferences from the teams involved, along with overnight replays.\n\n\n==== HDTV coverage ====\nThe Final Four has been broadcast in HDTV since 1999. From 2000 to 2004, only one first/second round site and one regional site were designated as HDTV sites. In 2005, all regional games were broadcast in HDTV, and four first and second round sites were designated for HDTV coverage. Local stations broadcasting in both digital and analog had the option of airing separate games on their HD and SD channels, to take advantage of the available high definition coverage. Beginning in 2007, all games in the tournament (including all first and second-round games) were available in high definition, and local stations were required to air the same game on both their analog and digital channels. However, due to satellite limitations, first round \"constant\" feeds were only available in standard definition. Moreover, some digital television stations, such as WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, choose to not participate in HDTV broadcasts of the first and second rounds and the regional semifinals, and used their available bandwidth to split their signal into digital subchannels to show all games going on simultaneously. By 2008, upgrades at the CBS broadcast center allowed all feeds, flex and constant, to be in HD for the tournament.\n\n\n=== International broadcasts ===\n\nAs of 2011, ESPN International holds international broadcast rights to the tournament, distributing coverage to its co-owned networks and other broadcasters. ESPN produces the world feed for broadcasts of the Final Four and championship game, produced using ESPN College Basketball staff and commentators.\n\n\n== Tournament statistics ==\n\n\n=== Low seeded teams ===\n\n\n==== Most successful low seeds ====\nBest outcomes for low seeds since expansion to 64 teams in 1985:\n\n\n==== Best performances by No. 16 seeds ====\nIn 2018, UMBC became the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in the men's tournament, shocking Virginia 74\u201354. Before this breakthrough, five other 16 seeds lost by 4 or fewer points:\n\nWhile ultimately Murray State lost to Michigan State by 4 points (75\u201371) in 1990, it was the only No. 16 team to take a game into overtime.\nEast Tennessee State lost to Oklahoma in 1989 (1 point, 72\u201371)\nPrinceton lost to Georgetown in 1989 (1 point, 50\u201349)\nWestern Carolina lost to Purdue in 1996 (2 points, 73\u201371)\nFairleigh Dickinson lost to Michigan in 1985 (4 points, 59\u201355)\n\n\n==== Additional low-seed stats ====\nVillanova in 1985, a No. 8 seed, was the lowest seeded team to win the tournament.\nThe lowest-seeded combination in the national championship game is the 2014 pairing of No. 7 seed UConn and No. 8 seed Kentucky. UConn won, to become the second-lowest-seeded team to win the tournament.\nThe pairing of No. 8 seed Butler and No. 11 seed VCU in the 2011 National Semifinals game had the lowest seeded combination (No. 8 v. No. 11) to play in a National Semifinals game.\nPenn's 1979 Final Four appearance is also notable as they made it as a No. 9 seed\u2014out of 10 teams in their region\u2014making them the lowest seed to make the Final Four in the pre-64-team era.\nButler is the only team to make consecutive Final Fours (let alone Championship Games) while not being a No. 1 or No. 2 seed either time (No. 5 in 2010, No. 8 in 2011).\n1991, 2013, and 2016 were the only years where at least one team of every seed (other than the No. 16s) advanced to the Round of 32.\nRichmond is the only team to win first-round games ranked as a No. 15, No. 14, No. 13, and No. 12 seed.\n2012 was the only tournament to feature two upsets by No. 15 seeds over No. 2 seeds in the round of 64 (there have been eight all-time).\n1986, 1995, and 2015 were the only tournaments to feature two upsets by No. 14 seeds over No. 3 seeds in the round of 64.\n2014 produced the highest total seed differential in an NCAA Tournament, with 111 across all the rounds of play. That is, the aggregate seed difference among the 22 games won by lower-seeded teams (e.g., No. 14 Mercer over No. 3 Duke, No. 8 Kentucky over No. 1 Wichita State) was 111.\n2013 was the only tournament to have three teams seeded No. 12 or lower in the Sweet Sixteen: No. 12 Oregon, No. 13 La Salle, and No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast.\n2017, South Carolina entering as a 7th seed in their region, beat Duke a No. 2 seed, Baylor, a No. 3 seed and Florida, a No. 4 seed to reach the Final Four.\nThe 2018 South Region was the first regional since seeding began in 1979 in which no top-4 seed advanced to the Sweet Sixteen (No. 5 Kentucky, No. 7 Nevada, No. 9 Kansas State, No. 11 Loyola\u2013Chicago).\nFurthermore, the Elite Eight pairing of No. 9 Kansas State and No. 11 Loyola-Chicago was the lowest-seeded pairing to play in a Regional Final.\nGeorgetown is the only team to lose in five consecutive tournament appearances against a team seeded at least five spots lower:\n2008 (Round of 32): No. 10 Davidson 74, No. 2 Georgetown 70.\n2010 (Round of 64): No. 14 Ohio 97, No. 3 Georgetown 83.\n2011 (Round of 64): No. 11 VCU 74, No. 6 Georgetown 56.\n2012 (Round of 32): No. 11 NC State 66, No. 3 Georgetown 63.\n2013 (Round of 64): No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast 78, No. 2 Georgetown 68.\n\n\n==== Notable point spread upsets ====\nAs noted above, despite numerous instances of early-round tournament upsets, only one No. 1 seed has lost in the first round to a No. 16 seed. However, while seeding is one way of measuring the impact of an upset, prior to the implementation of seeding, point spread was the better determinant of an upset, and a loss by a highly favored team remains for many the definition of \"upset\". As the NCAA forbids any association with gambling, and point spreads vary depending on the bookie taking the bets, these are unofficial.\n\nBiggest point-spread upsets since expansion to 64 teams in 1985:Norfolk State +21.5 over Missouri 86\u201384 in 2012\nUMBC +20.5 over Virginia 74\u201354 in 2018\nSanta Clara +20 over Arizona 64\u201361 in 1993.\nCoppin State +18.5 over South Carolina 78\u201365 in 1997\nArkansas\u2013Little Rock +17.5 over Notre Dame 90\u201383 in 1986\nHampton +17.5 over Iowa State 58\u201357 in 2001Biggest point-spread upsets in NCAA Championship Game history:Connecticut +9.5 over Duke, 77\u201374, in 1999\nVillanova +9 over Georgetown, 66\u201364, in 1985\nKansas +8 over Oklahoma, 83\u201379, in 1988\nNorth Carolina State +7.5 over Houston, 54\u201352 in 1983\nTexas Western +6.5 over Kentucky, 72\u201365 in 1966\n\n\n=== Highly seeded teams ===\n\n\n==== All No. 1 seeds in the Final Four ====\n\nIt has happened only once that all four No. 1 seeds made it to the Final Four:\n\n2008 \u2013 Kansas (champion), North Carolina, UCLA, Memphis\n\n\n==== Final Fours without a No. 1 seed ====\nThrice (twice since the field expanded to 64 teams) the Final Four has been without a No. 1 seed:\n\n1980 \u2013 No. 2 Louisville (champion), No. 5 Iowa, No. 6 Purdue, No. 8 UCLA\n2006 \u2013 No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Florida (champion), No. 4 LSU, No. 11 George Mason\n2011 \u2013 No. 3 Connecticut (champion), No. 4 Kentucky, No. 8 Butler, No. 11 VCUSince 1985, there have been 4 instances of three No. 1 seeds reaching the Final Four; 13 instances of two No. 1 seeds making it; and 14 instances of just one No. 1 seed reaching the Final Four.\n\n\n==== No. 1 seeds in the Championship Game ====\nThere have been eight occasions (seven times since the field expanded to 64) that the championship game has been played between two No. 1 seeds:\n\n1982 \u2013 North Carolina beat Georgetown\n1993 \u2013 North Carolina beat Michigan\n1999 \u2013 Connecticut beat Duke\n2005 \u2013 North Carolina beat Illinois\n2007 \u2013 Florida beat Ohio State\n2008 \u2013 Kansas beat Memphis\n2015 \u2013 Duke beat Wisconsin\n2017 \u2013 North Carolina beat GonzagaSince 1985 there have been 18 instances of one No. 1 seed reaching the Championship Game (No. 1 seeds are 13\u20135 against other seeds in the title game) and 8 instances where no No. 1 seed made it to the title game.\n\n\n==== Additional No. 1 seed stats ====\nIn 1997, Arizona achieved a record when it became the only team to beat three No. 1 seeds in a single tournament. Arizona (No. 4 seed) beat Kansas in its own Southeast region, then beat North Carolina in the Final Four and finally Kentucky in the Championship game. The most No. 1 seeds any team can face in the tournament is three (provided that the team itself is not a No. 1 seed, in which case it can only face two No. 1 seeds in the tournament).\nIn 2011, the highest seed to advance to the Final Four was No. 3 seed Connecticut, making the 2011 tournament the only time that neither a No. 1 seed nor a No. 2 seed advanced into the final weekend of play. In the same tournament, Butler made history as the first program to make consecutive Final Fours while not being seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in either season.\nThere have been 16 teams that have entered the tournament unbeaten. Four of those teams were from UCLA, and all those Bruin teams won each of those tournaments. However, of the other 12 teams entering the tournament unbeaten, just three went on to win the tournament. For details, see table below.\nIn 1980, 1981, and 1982, when the tournament was 48 teams, DePaul was seeded No. 1 but was defeated in the first round.\nTheoretically, a No. 1 seed's most difficult six-game path to win the tournament is to defeat a No. 16, a No. 8, a No. 4, a No. 2, a No. 1, and a No. 1 \u2013 the highest possible opposing seeds in successive rounds. No No. 1 seed has ever won all six such games, though two teams have won the first five.\nIn the 2002 tournament, Maryland reached the final after defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1; they won the tournament after defeating No. 5 Indiana in the final.\nIn the 2015 tournament, Wisconsin reached the final after defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1. In the final, they faced No. 1 Duke with a chance to complete the full six-game path. However, Wisconsin lost the final.\n\n\n==== Teams No. 1 in national polls ====\nThe following teams entered the tournament ranked No. 1 in at least one of the AP, UPI, or USA Today polls and won the tournament:\n\n\n==== Performance of undefeated teams ====\nThe team's record here refers to their record before the first game of the NCAA tournament.\n\n\n==== Undefeated teams not in the tournament ====\nThe NCAA tournament has undergone dramatic expansion since 1975, and since the tournament was expanded to 48 teams in 1980, no unbeaten teams have failed to qualify. (As, by definition, a team would have to win its conference tournament, and thus secure an automatic bid to the tournament, to be undefeated in a season, the only way a team could finish undefeated and not reach the tournament is if the team is banned from postseason play; as of 2016, no team banned from postseason play has finished undefeated since 1980. Other possibilities for an undefeated team to fail to qualify: the team is independent, or the conference does not yet have an automatic bid.) Before that, there were occasions on which a team achieved perfection in the regular season, yet did not appear in the NCAA tournament.\n\nDuring 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn't until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\nDuring 1940, Seton Hall finished the regular season 19\u20130, but their record had been built largely against weak teams and thus did not earn them an invitation to the postseason tournament.\nDuring 1941, Milwaukee State finished the regular season 16\u20130, but their record had been built largely against weak teams and thus did not earn them an invitation to the postseason tournament.\nDuring 1944, Army finished the regular season unbeaten. But owing to World War II, the Cadets did not accept an invitation to postseason play.\nDuring 1954, Kentucky finished 25\u20130 and were invited to the tournament, but declined the invitation.\nDuring 1973 the North Carolina State Wolfpack finished the regular season 27\u20130 and ranked #2 (behind undefeated and eventual tournament champion UCLA) but were barred from participating in the NCAA tournament while on probation for recruiting violations.\nDuring 1979, the Alcorn State Braves finished the regular season 27\u20130, but did not receive an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The Braves accepted a bid to the NIT, where they lost in the second round to eventual NIT champion Indiana.\n\n\n==== Champions absent the next year ====\nThere have been nine times in which the tournament did not include the reigning champion (the previous year's winner):\n\n1978 champion Kentucky went 19\u201312 in 1979. The Wildcats accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, losing their first-round game in overtime to Clemson, 68\u201367.\nBoth 1979 champion Michigan State (12\u201315) and 1979 runner up Indiana State (16\u201311) failed to qualify for the 1980 NCAA Tournament. Furthermore, neither was invited to the National Invitation Tournament, and Michigan State is the only team to finish the subsequent season with a losing record. Following the 1979 NCAA tournament, Indiana State lost Larry Bird to graduation, and Magic Johnson left Michigan State after his sophomore season to enter the NBA draft.\n1983 champion North Carolina State went 19\u201313 in 1984. The Wolfpack accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, losing their first-round game to Florida State, 74\u201371 in Reynolds Coliseum.\n1986 champion Louisville went 18\u201314 in 1987. The team declined an invitation to the postseason National Invitation Tournament.\n1988 champion Kansas went 19\u201312 in 1989. However, the team was ineligible for participation in the 1989 NCAA Tournament due to NCAA sanctions for recruiting violations.\n2007 (and 2006) champion Florida and 2007 runner up Ohio State both failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament in 2008. Both accepted invitations to that year's postseason National Invitation Tournament, and both made it to the semifinals. Florida fell to Massachusetts in the semifinals, and Ohio State beat UMass in the NIT Championship Game to win the tournament.\n2009 champion North Carolina went 20\u201317 in 2010. The Tar Heels accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, and reached the finals, losing to Dayton.\n2012 champion Kentucky went 21\u201311 in 2013 and failed to make that tournament. The Wildcats were invited to the National Invitation Tournament, where they lost to Robert Morris in the first round of the tournament.\n2014 champion UConn went 20\u201314 in 2015 and failed to make that tournament. The Huskies were invited to the National Invitation Tournament and lost to Arizona State in the first round.\n\n\n=== Coaches ===\n\n\n==== Most national championships ====\n10 National ChampionshipsJohn Wooden (1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975)5 National ChampionshipsMike Krzyzewski (1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, 2015)4 National ChampionshipsAdolph Rupp (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958)3 National ChampionshipsJim Calhoun (1999, 2004, 2011)\nBob Knight (1976, 1981, 1987)\nRoy Williams (2005, 2009, 2017)2 National ChampionshipsDenny Crum (1980, 1986)\nBilly Donovan (2006, 2007)\nHenry Iba (1945, 1946)\nEd Jucker (1961, 1962)\nBranch McCracken (1940, 1953)\nDean Smith (1982, 1993)\nPhil Woolpert (1955, 1956)\nJay Wright (2016, 2018)1 National Championship\n\n\n==== National championships among active coaches ====\n5 Mike Krzyzewski (1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, 2015)\n3 Roy Williams (2005, 2009, 2017)\n3 Jim Calhoun (1999, 2004, 2011)\n2 Jay Wright (2016, 2018)\n1 Tony Bennett (2019)\n1 Jim Boeheim (2003)\n1 John Calipari (2012)\n1 Tom Izzo (2000)\n1 Bill Self (2008)\n1 Tubby Smith (1998)\n\n\n==== Schools winning a national championship under multiple coaches ====\nFive coachesKentucky: Adolph Rupp, Joe B.

The filling out of a tournament bracket has been referred to as a \"national pastime.\" Filling out a tournament bracket with predictions is called the practice of \"bracketology\" and sports programming during the tournament is rife with commentators comparing the accuracy of their predictions. On The Dan Patrick Show, a wide variety of celebrities from various fields (such as Darius Rucker, Charlie Sheen, Neil Patrick Harris, Ellen DeGeneres, Dave Grohl, and Brooklyn Decker) have posted full brackets with predictions. Former President Barack Obama's bracket was posted on the White House website.\nThere are many tournament prediction scoring systems. Most award points for correctly picking the winning team in a particular match up, with increasingly more points being given for correctly predicting later round winners. Some provide bonus points for correctly predicting upsets, the amount of the bonus varying based on the degree of upset. Some just provide points for wins by correctly picked teams in the brackets.\nThere are 2^63 or 9.2 quintillion possibilities for the possible winners in a 64-team NCAA bracket, making the odds of randomly picking a perfect bracket (i.e. without weighting for seed number) 9.2 quintillion to 1. With the expansion of the tournament field to 68 teams in 2011, there are now 2^67 or 147.57 quintillion possibilities if one includes the first four opening round games.\nThere are numerous awards and prizes given by companies for anyone who can make the perfect bracket. One of the largest was done by a partnership between Quicken Loans and Berkshire Hathaway, which was backed by Warren Buffett, with a $1 billion prize to any person(s) who could correctly predict the outcome of the 2014 tournament. No one was able to complete the challenge and win the $1 billion prize.\n\n\n=== Tournament associated terms ===\nAs indicated below, none of these phrases are exclusively used in regard to the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, they are associated widely with the tournament, sometimes for legal reasons, sometimes just because it's become part of the American sports vernacular.\n\n\n==== March Madness ====\nMarch Madness is a popular\non-ending basketball tournaments played in March. March Madness is also a registered trademark currently owned exclusively by the NCAA.\nH. V. Porter, an official with the Illinois High School Association (and later a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame), was the first person to use March Madness to describe a basketball tournament. Porter published an essay named March Madness during 1939, and during 1942, he used the phrase in a poem, Basketball Ides of March. Through the years the use of March Madness was increased, especially in Illinois, Indiana, and other parts of the Midwest. During this period the term was used almost exclusively in reference to state high school tournaments. During 1977, Jim Enright published a book about the Illinois tournament entitled March Madness.Fans began associating the term with the NCAA tournament during the early 1980s. Evidence suggests that CBS sportscaster Brent Musburger, who had worked for many years in Chicago before joining CBS, popularized the term during the annual tournament broadcasts. The NCAA has credited Bob Walsh of the Seattle Organizing Committee for starting the March Madness celebration in 1984.Only during the 1990s did either the IHSA or the NCAA think about trademarking the term, and by that time a small television production company named Intersport had already trademarked it. IHSA eventually bought the trademark rights from Intersport, and then went to court to establish its primacy. IHSA sued GTE Vantage, an NCAA licensee that used the name March Madness for a computer game based on the college tournament. During 1996, in a historic ruling, Illinois High School Association v. GTE Vantage, Inc., the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit created the concept of a \"dual-use trademark\", granting both the IHSA and NCAA the right to trademark the term for their own purposes.\nAfter the ruling, the NCAA and IHSA joined forces and created the March Madness Athletic Association to coordinate the licensing of the trademark and investigate possible trademark infringement. One such case involved a company that had obtained the internet domain name marchmadness.com and was using it to post information about the NCAA tournament. During 2003, by March Madness Athletic Association v. Netfire, Inc., the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided that March Madness was not a generic term, and ordered Netfire to relinquish the domain name to the NCAA.Later during the 2000s, the IHSA relinquished its ownership share in the trademark, although it retained the right to use the term in association with high school championships. During October 2010, the NCAA reached a settlement with Intersport, paying $17.2 million for the latter company's license to use the trademark.\n\n\n==== Sweet Sixteen ====\nThis is a popular term for the regional semifinal round of the tournament, consisting of the final 16 teams. As in the case of \"March Madness\", this was first used by a high school federation\u2014in this case, the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA), which has used the term for decades to describe its own season-ending tournaments. It officially registered the trademark in 1988. Unlike the situation with \"March Madness\", the KHSAA has retained sole ownership of the \"Sweet Sixteen\" trademark; it licenses the term to the NCAA for use in collegiate tournaments.\n\n\n==== Final Four ====\nThe term Final Four refers to the last four teams remaining in the playoff tournament. These are the champions of the tournament's four regional brackets, and are the only teams remaining on the tournament's final weekend. (While the term \"Final Four\" was not used during the early decades of the tournament, the term has been applied retroactively to include the last four teams in tournaments from earlier years, even when only two brackets existed.)\nSome claim that the phrase Final Four was first used to describe the final games of Indiana's annual high school basketball tournament. But the NCAA, which has a trademark on the term, says Final Four was originated by a Plain Dealer sportswriter, Ed Chay, in a 1975 article that appeared in the Official Collegiate Basketball Guide. The article stated that Marquette University \"was one of the final four\" of the 1974 tournament. The NCAA started capitalizing the term during 1978 and converting it to a trademark several years later.\nDuring recent years, the term Final Four has been used for other sports besides basketball. Tournaments which use Final Four include the EuroLeague in basketball, national basketball competitions in several European countries, and the now-defunct European Hockey League. Together with the name Final Four, these tournaments have adopted an NCAA-style format in which the four surviving teams compete in a single-elimination tournament held in one place, typically, during one weekend. The derivative term \"Frozen Four\" is used by the NCAA to refer to the final rounds of the Division I men's and women's ice hockey tournaments. Until 1999, it was just a popular nickname for the last two rounds of the hockey tournament; officially, it was also known as the Final Four.\n\n\n==== Cinderella team ====\nAlthough there is not any official definition of what constitutes a Cinderella team, there does seem to be a consensus that such teams represent small schools, are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNews coverage at CBS Sports, ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC Sports, Sporting News, Sports Illustrated",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, also known as St. Mary's Cathedral, is a Catholic cathedral in Wichita, Kansas, United States.  It is the seat of the Diocese of Wichita.\n\nThe first Catholic church was constructed in Wichita in 1872.  The cathedral parish was founded in 1887.  The present cathedral church was begun in 1906 and it was consecrated on September 19, 1912. It was designed by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray.  Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore dedicated the church in the presence of 30 other Catholic bishops.  Archbishop John J. Glennon of St. Louis delivered the sermon.  The cathedral was built at a cost of $220,000.  The building was constructed of Bedford stone.  It measures 169 feet (52 m) long and 100 feet (30 m) wide at the transepts.  The dome is 135 feet (41 m) feet from the ground.  The bronze doors, which were designed and created Domus Dei of Italy, were installed in 1997.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Catholic cathedrals in the United States\nList of cathedrals in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Cathedral Site\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Wichita Official Site",

          "The city walls are under recontraction but it is still a nice part of the city and gives tourists a good impression that the people there care for their past.",
          "Wandering in the centre of the city of Baku is very enjoyable! People are friendly and even the salespeople at the market are modest and not pushy. I had the pleasant experience that an Azeri youngster returned my iPod when I left that at a restaurant. Very honest people,",
          "Walls are still under renovation... some terraces and nice fa\u00e7ades in and outside are the best places to be in the city.",
          "The city walls are a great sight seen. Surrounded of history on the inside and outside are always great for pictures and area for a great walk during the day, you can't appreciate all details during night so go while there is sun light.",
          "The city walls looks spectacular with the trees and Baku parks/fountains in the background. Must see them...Gives you a great feel of the historical city..",
          "This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so don't miss the opportunity to see something really special. The walls can be seen from various points, and a walking tour will let you see the best of the Old City.",

          "I think they have been rebuilt but its the sort of wall everyone would love round their own house, its no disneyland but very nice and seems real",
          "This is a great place to take and gentle stroll and take in the 'old' town. The best way is follow your nose and wander through the streets and alleys. You can never get too lost because you always end up back on the main street. Lots of small bars, restaurants and cafes to",
          "The ancient (or at least old) walls are very beautiful when lit up at night. They are also near the town center which you don't see from the main roads. This area is very lively for eating and shopping day and night.",
          "Basically the same as my review of the old city. The walls do not surround the whole of the old city. There is a decent , but very smallish park near to the Slovenian Embassy, but really nothing to set the heart alight.",
          "Restored 12th century walls, some ongoing restoration still happening. Very clean and tidied up walls. It used to be a double wall and had a ditch beyond it. All this has gone. And modern gates included too. Limestone very very clean.",
          "Impressive, massive walls. It is good to see, that history is combined in the modern times. Some parts of the walls were under reconstruction still.",
          "Many diplomatic offices inside. Lots of small street vendors. Many beuatiful things to see, most very old, thousands of years old. Very cool.",
          "Walk around the city inside an it reminds you of being in the Middle East. Small streets, cafes, and shops. The walled city can be seen best from the outside of the old city. Take your time and enjoy.",
          "Fairly complete and nice to see. You don't seem to be able to walk on them though",
          "OK , interesting historically but as usual in Baku , its smelly, dirty, beggars everywhere.",
          "wow, very good, this is a tower and very big, this is my favourite.",
          "Very well preserved. Very local vibe too as people still live within the old city walls. Its quite charming."

        "wiki": "The Maiden Tower (Azerbaijani: Q\u0131z qalas\u0131) is a 12th-century monument in the Old City, Baku, Azerbaijan. Along with the Shirvanshahs' Palace, dated to the 15th century, it forms a group of historic monuments listed in 2001 under the UNESCO World Heritage List of Historical Monuments as cultural property, Category III. It is one of Azerbaijan's most distinctive national emblems, and is thus featured on Azeri currency notes and official letterheads.The Maiden Tower houses a museum, which presents the story of historic evolution of the Baku city. It also has a gift shop. The view from the roof takes in the alleys and minarets of the Old City, the Baku Boulevard, the house of Isa bek Hajinski and a wide vista of the Baku Bay.\nThe Tower is covered by cloud of mysteries and legends which are rooted to the history and culture of Azerbaijan.  Indeed, some epics became a subject for scenario for ballets and theatre's plays. The Maiden Tower (ballet) is a world class Azerbaijani ballet created by Afrasiyab Badalbeyli in 1940 and ballet's remake was performed in 1999.\nConsequent to the receding of the sea shore line of the Caspian Sea, a strip of land emerged. This land was developed between the 9th and 15th centuries, when the walls of the old city, the palace including the huge bastion of the Maiden Tower were built.\n\n\n== History ==\nSome scientific sources indicate that the Maiden Tower is a paramount example of Zoroastrianism and the pre-Islamic architecture in Iran and Azerbaijan. Prof Davud A.Akhundov provides archeological and architectural evidences and argues that the Tower is Zoroastrians' Fire temple-Tower which had 7 fire exits on the top of the tower. Zoroastrian believed that there are 7 Steps or 7 Sky to reach heaven.\nDavud A.Akhundov and Hassan Hassanov date the fire temple-tower approximately as 8th-7th century B.C.The Maiden Tower set in the south-east part of Icheri Sheher, has mystique and hoary history and legends that are linked to two periods, though not conclusively established. The area was first settled in the Palaeolithic period.\n\nSara Ashurbeyli, Professor and prominent historian and expert in the history of Baku has calculated that the tower foundations, which extend 15 metres below ground level and the bottom three stories above ground, were originally built between the 4th and 6th centuries CE and points out the marked difference in the stone used in the tower compared to the stone used in the medieval city surrounding it. This conclusion is partly supported by historian Prof Bretanitskiy who has postulated that the tower was partly built in the 5th to 6th centuries and then later in the 12th century. The site was believed to have been used originally during the Sasanid era as a Zoroastrian temple. An inscription located 14 metres high on the south wall which in old Kufic script mentions Qubbeye Masud ibn Davud or Kubey Mesud ibn Da\u2019ud, an architect active during the 12th century; he is the father of the architect who built the Mardakan Round Tower. However it is disputed as the inscription, unlike the Madakan Tower does not actually reveal him to have been the architect, although it is generally agreed that much of the modern tower dates back to the 12th century. Prof. Ahmadov believes that the tower was used as an astronomical observatory from the time of this reconstruction, due to the fact that 30 hewed stone protuberances on the tower's lower section and the 31 protuberances on the upper section, linked with a stone belt, correlate to the days of the month.According to recent archaeological excavations, carried out in 1962\u201363 on the ground floor of the tunnel, the tower was built on a large rock sloping toward the sea, and the buttress structure projecting out from the main tower provided stability to the tower. Further excavations have also revealed wooden girders, each 14 metres (46 ft) high, at the foundation of the tower. This has been inferred as an earthquake resistant design. It has also been conjectured that the cylindrical shape of the tower with 5 metres (16 ft) thick base walls tapering to 4.5 metres (15 ft) (4 metres (13 ft) is also mentioned) provided the solid foundation on which it has survived over the centuries. It is also mentioned that the tower was built at one go and not at different times as inferred by other scholars.The tower and other wall structures now under the UNESCO list were strengthened during the Russian rule in 1806 and have survived.The Maiden Tower is depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 1 to 250 manat banknotes of 1992\u20132006, and of the 10 manat banknote issued since 2006, as well as on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 50 q\u0259pik coin minted between 1992-2006 and the reverse 5 q\u0259pik coin minted since 2006.\n\n\n== Legends and mysteries ==\nThere are various mysteries and legends related to Baku Maiden Tower. However, the main mystery is: the Tower's design and purpose. Meanwhile, there are up to 20 legends related to Baku Maiden Tower. A large number of them are connected to the Islamic and Medieval period of Baku's history. But others are rooted deeply in Azerbaijan's Zoroastrian or pre-Islamic history, religion and culture. Probably, the most famous legend is that of the fiery-haired virgin girl who saved Baku's people from slavery. The epic shows roots to Azerbaijan's Zoroastrian believes and culture and has reached down to modern times.\n\n\n=== The legend of the fiery-haired girl ===\nOnce upon a time, there was an ancient town-fortress of Baku. The fortress had a Fire Temple-Tower. In very ancient times, an enemy encircled the fortress. The enemy ordered Baku's people to surrender but they refused. So the enemy launched a siege to demolish the fortress and capture all inhabitants as slaves. Many fortress' defenders died trying to stop enemy attacks. Meanwhile, the enemy's commander ordered the water supply lines to be cut. So everybody was thirsty inside the fortress. No water no food, only blood and death. And the Supreme Magi, together with other priests, prayed to the Holy Fire in the fortress' Fire Temple-Tower, asking the God of Ahura Mazda to help the people. They prayed day and night asking Ahura Mazda to save their life and to push the enemy back. Finally, he heard their prayers. On the next day, the people saw that a large piece of the Holy Fire fell down from the top of the Fire Temple-Tower. A beautiful girl came out from the fire. She had long fire-colored hair. The crowd went down on their knees and started to pray to her. She said: \"Don't worry. I'll help and protect you. Give me a sword and a helmet. The enemy should not see my girl's hair, open a fortress' gate\". Meanwhile, the enemy's commander was waiting outside for the fortress' pahlevan for one-to-one combat. If the fortress' pahlevan had won the fight, then the enemy's army would back away. But if the enemy won, they would capture the fortress and all surviving inhabitants would be slaves. The fortress' gate was opened and the enemy's commander saw that one pahlevan was coming to fight him. The heavy battle began. In one of God's blessed moments, the fortress' pahlevan unhorsed the enemy and put a knife direct to his neck. The enemy's commander screamed: \"You win! Who are you? Take your helmet off. I want to see your face, pahlevan!\" He took off the helmet and saw that the fortress' pahlevan was a beautiful girl with long fire-colored hair. He exclaimed: \"Oh, you are a girl! You are brave and beautiful girl! If girls of Baku are so brave, I'll never capture your fortress! Don't kill me, beauty!\" He fell in love with her for her beauty and bravery. He asked her to marry him. Of course, the girl did not kill him. She fell in love with him too for his open heart. Thus, the enemy did not capture Baku and the local people named a tower as the Maiden tower.\n\n\n=== The legend of why Baku tower's fires stopped burning ===\nThe next legend also has Zoroastrian roots:\nOnce upon a time, an enemy besieged the fortress of Baku. However, Baku's people refused the enemy's request surrender. They decided to fight and defend their lives and fortress. So Baku's people fought with great bravery but the situation inside the fortress became more and more perilous. The enemy implemented a tight siege to overthrow the defenders. The enemy cut the water supply. With no water and food, the defenders did not have any chance of survival. Meanwhile, Supreme Magi with other priests prayed in the fortress' Holy Fire Temple-Tower. All together, they prayed to God of Ahura Mazda asking him to protect and help the people. After several days of non-stop praying, He heard priests' blessings and prayers. A strong and devastating earthquake occurred. Thousand of enemies perished as a result and some survivors, ran away. Thus, the people of Baku escaped slavery but the Holy Fires were stopped on the top of the Fire Temple-Tower.\n\n\n=== Source of the name \"Maiden Tower\" ===\nProf Mahir Khalifa-zadeh believes that apart from legends, it has been difficult to find historical explanations or archaeological or written evidence as to why the tower was called the Maiden tower. In addition to epical backgrounds, it is believable that the word \"maiden\" means that the tower was not destroyed by any enemy and thus means (from the religious viewpoint) that it was never desecrated (touched) by the evil of Angra Mainyu and remains the \"virgin\" or \"maiden\" temple-tower of the Zoroastrianian God, Ahura Mazda.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe tower has been described as the \"most majestic and mysterious monument of Baku, the Gyz Galasy\", built on solid rock foundation, demonstrates right on the coast line, a fusion of Arabic, Persian and Ottoman influences. It was constructed alongside a natural oil well. It is a cylindrical eight story structure that rises to a height of 29.5 metres (97 ft) with a base diameter of 16.5 metres (54 ft). The internal space available in the tower is said to be adequate to accommodate 200 people. A long solid projection to the main tower faces east, which is oriented towards sunrise pointing to the equinoxes, which has led to the conclusion that it was built as an astronomical tower; while the buttress faces east, the door access to the tower faces southeast. Each floor of the tower has a shallow vaulted roof, \"a stone cupola\" that has a central opening. The thickness of the walls varies from 5 metres (16 ft) at the base tapering cylindrically to 3.2\u20134.2 metres (10\u201314 ft) at the top floors. All floors are connected by staircase which abuts the circular wall and are lighted by narrow windows or niches which flare inward. The structure built in stone masonry exhibits varying finished surfaces, which is inlaid with local grey limestone. The alternate courses of stone laid in gypsum plaster gives a black and white banded effect. The northwestern part of the tower retains the original surface finish. There is also a beak-like projection, a buttress, curved in shape, made in masonry. The earliest stonework has square corners.A detailed examination of the construction features of the tower by archaeologists suggests that the stone masonry, both on its interior and exterior surfaces, is diamond-shaped and is seen at the top as well as at the bottom of the tower wall. The diamond-shaped cut seen as a decorative feature, particularly on the outer face of the west side wall, is ornate at the top and plain at the bottom of the wall; a subtle feature noted throughout the tower suggests that it was built as one monolith unit at one period. However, the recent renovations are stated to be crude.\nWater WellAnother notable structure seen in the tower is a water well of 0.7 metres (2.3 ft) diameter, which is 21 metres (69 ft) deep (its depth is up to the aquifer) that has been discovered at the second floor of the tower. It has an entrance also at the ground level which was discovered by Archaeologist Abbas Islamov during a recent study of the tower. This well has been interpreted as rainwater harvesting structure and the water is said to be clean and fresh (though close to the sea). The ceramic pipe (30 centimetres (12 in) in diameter) plumbing seen running down from the niches of the tower into the well was meant as a supply source. Since the ancient plumbing system is said to be in its original form, it needs to be cleaned and its layout ascertained by further studies to describe the drainage network that was originally built as part of the tower. The ceramics of the plumbing system and the silt deposited in them could also help to fix the age of the tower by using thermo-luminescence technique.Also seen in the tower, between the 2nd floor and the 7th floor, is a gutter of semicircular shape at every floor. It is made of ceramic pipes fitted one above another and joined by lime mortar. The pipes are presumably produced with the potter's wheel technique. They are 20\u201325 centimetres (7.9\u20139.8 in) in diameter with 2.2 centimetres (0.87 in) thick walls and each segment is 40\u201345 centimetres (16\u201318 in) long. Similar gutters are seen from the ground floor up to the foundation level but with the four cornered ceramic pipes of 22 centimetres (8.7 in) \u00d7 18 centimetres (7.1 in) size, which run outside through the wall.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nSubsequent to the declaration of the entire cultural property including the tower and the city walls as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 2000, there was an earthquake which caused damage to the property. UNESCO, noting the lack of efforts by the national authorities to adequately conserve this cultural heritage then listed these monuments under the \"List of World Heritage in Danger,\" from 2004 to 2009 with the comment \"Loss of authenticity due in part to the earthquake in 2000 and to the urban development pressures.\" However, after the concerned authorities evolved a Conservation Master Plan and assured of adequate conservation and management of the property, the \"in danger\" tag attached to the heritage site has been removed by UNESCO in 2009. It was also requested that the State Party would submit to the World Heritage Centre, by 1 February 2010, an updated report on the state of conservation of the property and progress made for consideration by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe legendary tale of the king willing to force his daughter to marry a man she doesn't love, which she escapes by asking her father to first build a tower for her, and when it is finished committing suicide by jumping from the top of it has been the subject of many Azerbaijani poems and plays. However, the ballet titled \u201cMaiden Tower\", was the first Azerbaijani ballet composed by Afrasiyyab Badalbayli, in 1940. This ballet is performed at Baku's Opera and Ballet Theatre. However, the story line is a modified version of the legend. According to the modified version of the Ballet, the king on his return from his war campaign found that his wife had given birth to a daughter instead of a son. He became furious and ordered killing of his baby daughter. However, the baby's nanny took her away to a secret place where she grew up to a beautiful lady. At age seventeen she got engaged to a lover. At this juncture, the king chanced to see her, wanted to marry her and therefore took her away and kept her in the Maiden Tower. The girl's lover was furious with this turn of events and he managed to kill the king. He then ran to the Maiden Tower to rescue his lover. However, when the girl heard sound of foot steps approaching towards the tower, she thought that it was the king coming to see her and she immediately committed suicide by jumping down from the tower.As of 2011, the tower also participates in \"Earth Hour,\" a campaign against climate change in which large buildings \"go dark\" for an hour to draw awareness to the cause.\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape\nFire Temple of Baku\nList of World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSecrets of the Maiden Tower.

          "It is located in the Old City. The entrance ticket is 12 manat each which is not worth climbing so many stairs. You can view it from outside and take pictures from the roadside. There are many souvenir shops and restaurants nearby",

          "The building itself is old and very fascinating. Across multiple stories you get a sense of the towers purpose. What makes it three star; 1 - the staff are all young and sit playing videos and music on their phones which killed the vibe (maybe it's just because it was quirt",

          "The tower is interesting but at 12 manats for foreigners (2 for locals) it's a rip-off. The views are OK but a 2 metre high dirty perspex barrier at the top distorts views. More scenic city views can be had for free (if you walk) at the top of the funicular",

        "wiki": "Flame Towers (Azerbaijani: Alov q\u00fcll\u0259l\u0259ri) is a trio of skyscrapers in Baku, Azerbaijan, the height of the tallest tower is  182 m (597 ft). The three flame-shaped towers symbolize the element of fire - historically resonant in a region where natural gas flares shoot from the earth and Zoroastrian worshippers saw in fire a symbol of the divine (notably at the Ateshgah of Baku and Yanar Dag).The buildings consist of 130 residential apartments over 33 floors, a Fairmont hotel tower that consists of 250 rooms and 61 serviced apartments, and office blocks that provides a net 33,114 square meters of office space. The cost of Flame Towers was an estimated US$350 million. Construction began in 2007, with completion in 2012. HOK was the architect for the project, DIA Holdings served as the design-build contractor, and Hill International provided project management.The Flame Towers consist of three buildings: South, East and West. The facades of the three Flame Towers function as large display screens with the use of more than 10,000 high-power LED luminaires, supplied by the Osram subsidiary Traxon Technologies and Vetas Electric Lighting.On June 2014 Lamborghini opened its first branch in Azerbaijan, located on the ground floor of the East tower of the Flame Towers.\n\n\n== Illumination ==\nThe Flame Towers are completely covered with the LED screens that display the movement of a fire visible from the farthest points of the city.\nThe light show transitions from giant flames, the colours of the Azeri flag, a figure waving a flag, and giant tanks of water being filled. Transition times are approximately 2 minutes.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe building was featured in Extreme Engineering, a documentary television series that airs on the Discovery Channel and the Science Channel. The episode called \"Azerbaijan's Amazing Transformation\" was broadcast on 22 April 2011 as part of Season 9.\nThe Flame Towers also appeared prominently in trailers before many entries for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 hosted in Baku (and, in the next 4 years, with the pre song trailer based in the singer's home area, features in the trailer before the Azerbaijan song).\nThe towers are also a prominent landmark in Battlefield 4, with the first level of the single player campaign taking place in Baku. Additionally, the towers were shown frequently during coverage of the initial Formula One European Grand Prix held in Baku.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "The National Museum of History of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Milli Az\u0259rbaycan Tarixi Muzeyi) is the largest museum in Azerbaijan, located in Baku, in the former mansion of Azerbaijani oil magnate and philanthropist Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. It was founded in 1920 and opened to visitors in 1921.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building of the Museum was built in 1893\u20131902. The Italian Renaissance-style mansion is immense and takes up an entire city block. There are four floors in some parts of the building. It was designed by Polish architect J\u00f3zef Gos\u0142awski. \n\nWhen the Red Army entered Baku in April 1920, Taghiyev's residence \u2013 like that of other wealthy oil barons \u2013 was immediately confiscated. Under a resolution of the USSR People's Commissariat, the residence was established as a museum in June 1920, only two months after the Bolsheviks took Baku.\nIn May 1934, a special order was adopted to improve the teaching of history and geography in schools, or, more precisely, to inculcate the \u2018advantages\u2019 of socialist society in its members in order to nurture the rising generation in the ideology of the totalitarian regime. Marxist understanding of history was delivered through the establishments of historical research and other institutions. In addition, new kinds of historical and regional museums were created to inspire the teaching and promotion of history.\nThe network of museums with a historical profile was enlarged in regard with the new system. Furthermore, mechanisms of Soviet advocacy became much stronger and mouthpieces during this period. Moreover, the knowledge of the history of our native land was developed through the museum\u2019s achievements in research. In this fashion, phrases like \u201cthe first\u201d and \u201cfor the first time\u201d are often used when conversation turns to its ninety years of work. From 1925 to the 1960s, until the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences was made responsible for archaeological work, the foundations for the scientific investigation of ancient material and cultural monuments on the territory of Azerbaijan were laid under the direction of archaeologists Davud Sharifov, Yevgeniy Pakhomov, Ishak Jafar-Zadeh, Movsum Salamov, Saleh Gaziyev, Mammadali Huseynov. Excavations were carried out in Khojaly, Qabala, Ganja, Kharaba Gilan, Orangala, Mingechevir and other places. Museum\u2019s collection consists of the materials discovered during these excavations and from ethnographic expeditions. Undoubtedly, museum\u2019s collection allows enriching data for a great many books and theses.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nOn the second floor of Taghiyev's residence, side by side there are two major ballrooms. One is based on Oriental designs (Mauritanian) style and the other, on Occidental design. The Oriental Room has enormous plate glass windows, gilded arches, highly ornamental walls, ceilings and chandeliers. The lines in the Occidental Room are more perpendicular to each other \u2013 rectangular.\nAccording to photographs that are about 90 years old, one of the most elaborate rooms was Taghiyev's wife's boudoir (private sitting room). All of the movable furniture and paintings in this room have disappeared. Nothing remains today except the ornate mirrored mosaic ceiling. During the Soviet period, four layers of white paint were applied over the highly decorative floral designs on the walls. Still in the main halls of the residence, the original paint has withstood the passage of time incredibly well. The paint was made of finely ground egg shell as was the practice of artists of Byzantine icons. Nearly 100 years later, the original colors with their subtlety and sophistication have neither faded nor chipped.\n\n\n== Departments ==\nThe museum has more than 2000 exhibits and includes the following departments:\nModern history department\nEthnography department\nDepartment of ancient and medieval history of Azerbaijan\nScientific excursion department\nLaboratory for restoration of museum exhibits\nFund of Numismatics: Including the collection of Yevgeni Pakhomov\nArt design group\nLibrary\n\n\n=== Address ===\n4 Hadji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev str., Baku, 1005 (near \u201cSahil\u201d metro station).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Numismatic collection ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Azerbaijan\nGanja State History-Ethnography Museum\nZeynalabdin Taghiyev\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Azerbaijani and English)",

        "wiki": "The Palace of the Shirvanshahs (Azerbaijani: \u015eirvan\u015fahlar Saray\u0131, Persian: \u06a9\u0627\u062e \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0634\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646\u200e) is a 15th-century palace built by the Shirvanshahs and described by UNESCO as \"one of the pearls of Azerbaijan's architecture\". It is located in the Inner City of Baku, Azerbaijan and, together with the Maiden Tower, forms an ensemble of historic monuments inscribed under the UNESCO World Heritage List of Historical Monuments. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial-vaults, the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum (the so-called \"mausoleum of the dervish\"), south of the palace, a portal in the east, Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of a bath house. Earlier, there was an ancient mosque, next to the mausoleum. There are still ruins of the bath and the lamb, belong to the west of the tomb.In the past, the palace was surrounded by a wall with towers and, thus, served as the inner stronghold of the Baku fortress. Despite the fact that at the present time no traces of this wall have survived on the surface, as early as the 1920s, the remains of apparently the foundations of the tower and the part of the wall connected with it could be distinguished in the north-eastern side of the palace.There are no inscriptions that survived on the palace itself. Therefore, the time of its construction is determined by the dates in the inscriptions on the architectural monuments, which refer to the complex of the palace. Such two inscriptions were completely preserved only on the tomb and minaret of the Shah's mosque. There is the name of the ruler who ordered to establish these buildings in both inscriptions is the \u2013 Shirvan Khalil I (r. 1417\u20131462). As time of construction \u2013 839 (1435/36) was marked on the tomb, 845 (1441/42) on the minaret of the Shah's mosque.The burial vault, the palace and the mosque are built of the same material, the grating and masonry of the stone are the same.The complex used to occupy more area. There were rooms for court servants and services.The main buildings of the ensemble were built at different times. Despite this fact, these buildings are linked by unity of scale, by rhythm and proportionality of the basic architectural forms \u2013 cubic volumes of buildings, domes, portraits. The builders of the ensemble relied on the traditions of the Shirvan-Absheron architectural school.In 1964, the palace complex was declared a museum-preserve and taken under the protection of the state. In 2000, this ensemble, along with the fortified walls of the historic part of the city and the Maiden Tower, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.The palace is depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 10,000 manat banknote of 1994\u20132006 and of the 10 new manat banknote issued since 2006.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 15th century the Shirvanshah dynasty, under Ibrahim I of Shirvan, transferred his capital from Shemakha to Baku following a devastating earthquake. He committed himself to the construction of the \"palace\". The building is believed to be a memorial complex built around the sacred place of worship (pir) and tomb of Seyyid Yaxya Bakuvi who was a Helwati Sufi saint. The Shirvanshahs were patrons of the Helwati Sufiye order, and Shirvanshah Khalilullah I was buried with his family in the grounds of the palace. Other historians argue that the building was used as the ruler's palace. Both theories suffer from the absence of evidence. It is known that wells inside the grounds of the \"palace\" were considered to have healing qualities until recent times, as was the hill where the palace was built.\nAfter the Safavid conquest of Baku in 1501, the Sufi order was expelled. Over centuries the \"palace\" fell into ruin and was known in Baku as Baku Khans palace; this toponym moved into Russian historiography, first cited by Bartold.\nUntil 1501, there was not any information found about the building of the palace. According to one of the Persian chronicles, in 1501 the troops of Shirvanshakh Farrukh-yessar, the son Khalil-ully I, were defeated in Shemakha by the troops of Shah Ismail I from the Safavid dynasty. Farrukh-yessar was killed in the Battle of Shirvanshah; the troops of Ismail I, having defeated near Shemakha, moved to Baku, besieged it and after several assaults took the city. Then, a tall building of Shirvanshahs was destroyed due to the order of Shah Ismail I. After a while, the city of Baku and its entire district, as well as Shirvan, were governed by the governors who were placed by the Safavids. There is not any detailed information about the people who lived in the palace and in what state it was in the first half of the XVI century.In the second half of the 16th century, there was a war between the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire. In 1578, the Turks conquered Baku. From the time of the rule of the Ottoman Empire in the palace area, the gate in the palace wall surrounding the palace from the east has been preserved. From the inscription placed on the portal of this gate, it follows that they were built during the reign of the Turkish sultan Murad III (1574\u20131595 years of rule).Due to the literary works, there were Turkish pashas living in the palace at that time. The East Gate is a witness of this.Since the XVII century, the palace was empty, and there were not any government officials. The abbot of the monastery and the representative of the Isfahan mission Capuchin Pater Raphael du Mans in his essay in 1660 described Shirvanshah Palace in Baku fortress and gave information about its desolation and destruction. In 1723, Baku was besieged by the troops of Peter I, and the city was bombed. In this regard, the south-eastern facades of the palace suffered much. The palace was transferred to the Russian military department in the middle of the 19th century.The Russian military department made a partial renovation of the palace. At the same time, the significant restructuring was carried out, which adapted the palace facilities to warehouses for military equipment. Repairs carried out by the military department, along with the restoration of the destroyed parts, and led to the destruction of a number of parts required for the restoration of the palace. By adapting the building of the palace to the warehouse, the military department demolished a number of walls separating the rooms in the second and first floors, and there were semi-circular arches supporting the roof instead of them on the second floor.\nThe remains of domed, lancet and cross-slabs were destroyed in all the rooms on the second floor; they were replaced by flat beams. And window openings (double-glazed windows) of the second floor were laid out so that only small windows remained. New wide doorways were pierced.During this period, the Eastern Orthodox Church in Baku sought the demolition of the palace to build a Baku cathedral in its place. However, this petition was rejected by the tsarist authorities only because the premises of the palace were used for large warehouses.There was an entrance made to the second floor of the northern facade of the palace and a huge opening was punched in the wall. This was done so that the cart drawn by the horses from the street could enter the second floor of the palace. After making the above-mentioned reorganization, the military department attached a ladder to the eastern facade of the palace, and the entire southern (or lower) courtyard was surrounded by a stone wall with loopholes. This wall was erected from a foundation left from the old walls surrounding the palace. The palace ensemble is now protected by fortress walls erected in the first half of the 19th century.During existence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918\u20131920), a number of measures were taken to study and fix architectural monuments. Thus, at the end of 1918, the dimensional drawings of the Shirvanshahs Palace were made by the Ishmael Bek Nabi oglu, the architectural engineer. At the beginning of 1920, several cycles of lectures on the fate of the palace were read in the \"Society for the Study of the Muslim East\" by Ismail bek Nabi oglu. The periodical press indicated that the report was illustrated by various photographs and drawings of the palace. After the reports and debates, the presidium of the society was elected, which included chairman Professor Zimin, Comrade chairman I Belyaev, secretary-teacher Seidov and Kazioni Subkhanverdikhanov. The meeting instructed the presidium to organize an excursion to the palace in the near future.In 1920, the government of the Azerbaijani SSR began to take measures to protect the monument. Since 1920, the cleaning of the palace from the age-old layers of garbage and partial repairs began, accompanied by archaeological reconnaissance.In 1924 the works were continued. After the extensive repair and restoration works of 1932\u20131934, conducted by AzCUOP together with the Moscow State Restoration Workshops for projects designed by architect Boris Zasypkin, the building of the former Shirvanshah palace was given to the Azerbaijan History Museum AzFAN. Since the clay floors were fragile, and the building of the palace was intended for the organization of a museum in it, during the repair and restoration work the floors were covered with parquet. Also during the works from the window openings were laid the stones laid in the XIX century, and they were returned to their original appearance. The original layout of the second floor was not restored, due to the fact that the premises were supposed to be a museum: where there are only two rooms, there were originally eight rooms. The plan of the first floor was completely restored.In 1937-1938 under the guidance of archaeologist V.N. Leviatov, archaeological excavations were carried out in the palace and a large number of artifacts dating from the 12th\u201315th centuries were found. And the archaeological excavations conducted by Leviatov in 1945 on the territory of the palace ensemble, deep beneath the foundations of the surviving buildings, revealed the remains of a once densely populated residential quarter. Numerous fragments of ceramic products and coins date it to the 8th\u20139th centuries.For some time, the Azerbaijan People's Museum and the Museum of the History of Religion were located in the palace building. In 1960, the palace was turned into an architectural reserve, which in 1964 was transformed into the State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve \"Complex of the Shirvanshahs Palace\".In 1992, new restoration works began. The author of the restoration project of the palace complex was Niyazi Rzayev. Restoration began from the throne room. In 2000, at the 24th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the historical part of the city of Baku, Icheri Sheher, along with the palace, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site from Azerbaijan. These were the first objects included in the list of UNESCO, located on the territory of Azerbaijan. In 2006, the next restoration of the palace was completed.In 2017, the Maiden Tower and the Palace of the Shirvanshahs were awarded with the Certificate of Excellence.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== The plan of the palace ===\nThe Palace\nDivan-khana\nSeyid Mausoleum Yahya Bakuvi\nThe place of the destroyed Kei-Kubad mosque\nThe Eastern portal\nThe Palace Mosque\nThe Shrine\nPlace of bath\nOvdan.\n\n\n==== The main building (the Palace) ====\nThe building of the palace did not arise at once. The building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with three narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, octagonal vestibule behind it connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace.\nThe earliest building (approximately the end of the fourteenth century) is the central part (octagonal hall of the second floor). The part adjoining the western facade was added a little later. The western, northern and a small part of the eastern facades form an incomplete rectangle. The rest of the eastern facade and the entire southern facade are formed by two triangular lanterns and a broken line between them, enclosing four right angles.There were originally 52 rooms connected by three narrow spiral staircases in the palace building: 27 on the first and 25 on the second floor (currently 16 rooms on the second floor), and the layout of the second floor basically reproduced the plan of the first floor. The central part of the palace (octagonal hall of the second floor, the entrance to which is decorated with a portal) has thicker walls. Arranged in the western facade, the main entrance to the palace is decorated with a high portal. The ladder of the portal leads to a tall octagonal front hall, covered with a dome. It is assumed that this room served for receptions.\nThe small octagonal lobby behind it connected the hall to the rest of the rooms. Slit-shaped holes in the faces served as a voice connection with the lower floor, where the office premises were located. The rooms and rooms of the second floor are more ceremonial. Among them, there are the southern and eastern facades with bay windows that reveal the bay view. There are also rooms for the Shah and his family on the second floor.\nThe smooth surface of the large stone planes of the palace is shaded by alternating rows of masonry, differing in color, width and texture, as well as the \"shebeke\" aura \u2013 stone gratings in small light apertures.\nThere were daily-life objects, coins of the XII-XV centuries, copper utensils, weapons and decorations of the XIX century, musical instruments of the XV century found during the archaeological excavations both on the territory of the palace complex and in the territory of the historical center of Icheri-Sheher and Shirvan. There were also female costumes and embroidery of the XIX century, Shemakha carpets of the XIX century and carpet woven in the XVII century in Baku. There is a mock-up of the historic part of the city in the center of the hall. \n\n\n==== Divan-khana ====\n\nA small aperture, located on the north side of the palace garden, leads to the closed courtyard Divan-khana, which is framed on three sides by a pointed arcade. In the composition center Divan-khana there is an octagonal rotunda-pavilion. The hall of this rotunda is surrounded by an open arcade of the same warrant. The elliptical cover with a slightly pointed top is protected from the outside by a faceted stone dome. The western facade of the rotunda is decorated with arabesques which are stylized with a portal, the channeled half-cupola of the lancet conch is supported by a system of finely modeled stalactites (mucarnases). Overhead planes are covered with ornament. The portal leads to the canopy connecting the hall with the service rooms located one above the other.There are several versions of the appointment of Divan-khana. It was supposed to serve as a building for legal proceedings, receptions or state council, or perhaps, it was a mausoleum. The most common hypothesis is based on the common name of the monument, according to which it was assumed that it is a court, or a reception room of the palace, or the building of an \"order\". The features of the style and the incompleteness of the part of the decoration work allow one to date Divan-khana to the end of the 15th century, the time of the capture of Baku by the Safavid troops. The features of the plan, the dungeon-crypt and the content of the lapidary inscription above the entrance to the hall (Koran, Sura 10, verses 26 and 27) indicate his memorial appointment.The origin of the original architectural structure is also associated with the pre-Islamic funerary tradition. Historian Sara Ashurbeyli believes that even in pre-Islamic times, the occupied Divan-khan territory was a sacred place (it is assumed that the cup-shaped grooves served to collect the sacrificial blood of animals)\n\n\n==== The Keygubad Mosque ====\n\nIn the old days, a mosque was added to the mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi, which was called the \"old\" mosque. It is known as the \"Kei-Kubad Mosque\". This mosque was built at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century after the destruction of the older building on which it was built. The mosque was covered with a dome, which was supported by four stone columns that stood inside the mosque. The clutches of the mosque were tied up with the laying of the mausoleum. In 1918, the \"old\" mosque burned down during a fire. The image of this mosque and its brief description was given in the article of Andrei Pavlinov, who visited Baku and saw the mosque in 1888, published in the third issue of the journal \"Materials on the Archeology of the Caucasus\" (Moscow, 1893) Historian Abbasgulu Bakikhanov wrote that Bakuvi taught and prayed in the mosque: \"The cell where he prayed, the school where he worked and his grave are there, in the mosque\". Keygubad Shirvanshah ruled from 1317 to 1343 and was Sheikh Ibrahim's grandfather.In the 1920s, when E. A Pakhomov surveyed the mausoleum and ruins of the old mosque, it was discovered that the pedestal on which the base of one of the mosque columns stood, covers a narrow trench made in the ground and plastered into the crypt of the mausoleum. In this trench, there were several stone tombstones. When examining the crypt, it was found that there were scattered bones to twenty human skeletons. The bones were folded without observing any rules. This is due to the fact that at the place where the mausoleum stood and around it, there was once a cemetery. And during the construction of the mosque and digging foundation pits under the foundations, a number of burials were broken. Bones from the broken graves were collected and stacked in the mausoleum, and gravestones \u2013 in the trench. These tombstones are not preserved. Currently, on the site where the mosque once stood, there are two columns that once stood inside the mosque, as well as part of the wall with the roof.\n\n\n==== Mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi ====\n\nIn the southern courtyard, next to the palace, stands a mausoleum, built in the second half of the 15th century, called the mausoleum of the \"dervish\" and known as the burial of the court scholar Khalil Ili Seyid Yahya Bakuvi, who was engaged in medicine, mathematics, and astrology. The mausoleum has an octagonal body, which completes the pyramidal tent. The interior of the mausoleum consists of an underground crypt where the tombstone of Bakuvi is located, and a camera above it. Small octagonal volume of the mausoleum turns into a drum covered with a dome. On the sides of the mausoleum there are three small windows carved into solid slabs of limestone, and, like in the old days, they are through-through stone gratings, consisting of multi-beam stars. The archway in the northern part connects the mausoleum with an older mosque. According to Abbaskuli aga Bakikhanov, \"the cell where he prayed [Bakuvi], the school and the grave that are under the mosque named after him, still exist today\".\n\n\n==== The palace mosque ====\n\nIn the front of the lower courtyard, there is a mosque building with a minaret. In terms of the mosque is rectangular, has a large hall, a small women's chapel and service rooms. The northern portal is facing the Shirvanshahs burial vault. This portal is more solemn than the east, which was intended for the inhabitants of the palace, descending the semi-underground passage. The double-lighted hall is covered with a dome on spherical sails.Mihrab mosque is located at the southern end of the hall. Above the one-woman women's chapel there is also a domed room. It is inferior in size to the dome of the hall and repeats its outlines. Against the backdrop of the prismatic volume, completed by two domes with slightly pointed tunnels, a deeply shaded aperture of the mosque portal is clearly drawn.Above the northeast corner of the mosque stands a minaret, ending with a stalactite cornice supporting a balcony that had a stone barrier before. The inscription encircles the minaret below the stalactite cornice. It is executed in the font \"nash\" and contains an inscription. The inscription tells about the construction of the minaret, but not the mosque that was built at an earlier time. This is confirmed by the lack of a decorated rich portal and artistic inscriptions on it.\n\n\n==== The Eastern Portal ====\nOn the territory of the southern courtyard of the complex was the so-called Eastern Portal, also known as the \"Gate of Murad\". The construction of this portal completed the formation of the ensemble. Judging by the inscription on the portal niche, the portal was built during the years of occupation of Baku by Ottoman troops at the behest of a noble Bakrada of the Rajab Baba in 994 AH (1585/86) by architect Amir Shah of Vaillankoukh (suburb of Tabriz). Compared with the Divan-khana portals and the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the structure and forms of the portal are somewhat simplified. It has a less rich and elegant decor. The upper part of the portal is decorated with a building inscription in Arabic.The inscription has sockets with floral ornaments on both sides. In the lower part of the portal, there is a deep niche formed by a stalactite semi-double. Unlike other portals of the palace, the Eastern portal has a wide lancet entrance opening, similar to the gate. Sarah Ashurbeyli assumes that this structure was the entrance to a building that did not survive, or was not erected.\n\n\n==== Shrine ====\n\nNear the shah's mosque in the lower courtyard, in the wall separating the lower platform from the upper one, is located the building of the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the so-called \"Turbe\". This building is located directly opposite the entrance, overlapped by a pointed vault. Smooth wall of the facade is lined with Baku limestone with a careful fit of the seams. Above the building, there is a richly decorated portal to the tomb. This portal repeats the compositional reception of the Divan-khan portal, but in comparison with the latter it is somewhat easier to interpret (the stalactite arch consists of only four rows of stalactites, the side walls are smoothly solved, no niches, and only tympanum of the arches, a number of inscriptions in the font \"nash\" \u2013 Koranic (Surah XII, verse 92nd) and hadith.On the right and left of the portal's lancet aperture in two onion-shaped medallions are inscriptions with the name of the builder-architect of the tomb. In each medallion, the same inscription is repeated twice (in direct and mirror image) and contains the following words: Allah Muhammad Ali (an architect). Judging by the name, the architect was a Shiite. Above the ornamentation of the tympanum of the stalactite arch there is a strip with an inscription of a religious nature. In the tympanas, medallions are also arranged on each side, also with an inscription. The inscription above the entrance to the portal dates the construction of the burial vault 839 (1435/36) and reports that the tomb was built by Shirvanshah Halilullah for his mother and son.The portal leads to the canopy, on the right and left side of which are located associated with the opening of small rooms, probably intended for ministers of worship. The canopies lead to the main hall, which is cross-shaped in plan, and its central part is covered with a dome resting on the vaults of the branches of the cross and stone walls through a system of spherical sails. It is interesting that outside the stone dome was once covered with turquoise glaze.During the archaeological excavations in the tomb were found fragments of architectural details of tombstones in the hall, as well as a number of burials of members of the family of Halilullah. So, archaeological works in 1946 under the wooden floor of the tomb, a crypt was found with five burials, covered with stone slabs (one of them contained the remains of a child of 6\u20137 years old, apparently the son of Halilullah, the other \u2013 older women, probably the mother of Halilullah, the skeleton of a man is 18\u201319 years old). The continuation of the work in the tomb found a number of untouched tombs, the total number of which reached 14. The names of the members of the family of Halilullah can be found on the basis of odes, elegies and chronograms from the sofa of Badr Shirvani: the mother of Halilullah Bike khanum (died 839 AH / 1435/6), his sons Farrukh Yamin (born 839 AH / 1435/6, died in 846 AH / 1442/3 at the age of seven), Sheikh Saleh (born in 847 AH / 1443, died in 849 AH / 1445/6 at the age of 2 years), Mir Bahram (killed ( Shaheed) in the Kaytag steppe at a young age of 20 Muharram in 850 AH / 17 April 1446), Prince Muhammad Ibrahim (born 20 Muharram 836 / 16 September 1432), Farrukh Yasar (born 12 Muharram 845 AH / 2 June 1441).\n\n\n==== Bathhouses ====\n\nIn the lower courtyard of the complex, there is a bathhouse, the location of which does not allow us to contour the territory that belonged to the palace. It is assumed, however, that the bathhouse, built in the 15th century, was indeed a palace. The bath was cleared of blockages, and the internal layout of the bath was restored thanks to the conservation of the lower rows of wall masonry.The palace bath, like the vast majority of the baths of the East, was buried in the ground, but only the entrance portal and the domes of large halls were visible from the outside, the crowns of which ended with perforated lanterns that served as ventilation. Such a strong depth of the bath was typical for the baths of the entire Absheron peninsula.\nThe visitor of the bath from the vestibule-dressing room got into the soap-house, where there was a swimming pool for general ablution. To the soap adjoining large and small rooms, intended for all procedures that required a different temperature. The necessary temperature of the various rooms, depending on their destination, was tried to preserve the internal layout of the bath. In one of the last chambers of the bathhouse, there was a tank with hot water. Under it, there was a firebox, which served to heat all the premises of the bath. The underground, the stables and the walls of the baths were heated by a branched system of heat-conducting channels.\n\n\n==== Ovdan ====\nNot far from the bathhouse is located the ovdan \u2013 a reservoir which was one of the largest in the Fortress of the Ovdans. This ovdan supplied drinking water not only to the palace, but also to the entire surrounding area. This assumption is confirmed by the nearby small, built in the 14th century Chin Mosque, which is believed to have served the residents of the nearby area. Ovdan supplied water to the palace bathhouse.Ovdan is a spacious reservoir located deep underground, which was ventilated by means of a special vertical shaft. Such a structure is typical for most of the ovdans surviving till the present day. To descend into the reservoir was possible by a gentle staircase, which was blocked by a lancet arch.Water came into the ovdan from a well-kept underground water pipe or kyhryza. The water intake structures of this water pipe were quite far from the city.\n\n\n== In culture ==\nImages of the Shirvanshahs palace can be found on the works of such artists as Grigory Gagarin, Georgy Hohenfelden, in the photographs of Richard Thiele. In 1990, the postage stamp of the USSR, dedicated to the palace, was issued. Later, the image of the palace appeared on the postage stamps of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Also, Shirvanshah's palace was depicted on an Azerbaijani banknote with a face value of 10,000 manats. Description of the palace is found in the novel of Kurban Said \"Ali and Nino.\"\n\n\n=== Palace complex in cinematography ===\nThe architecture of the palace several times fell into the footage of Leonid Gaidai's film The Diamond Arm (1969), which was also filmed in the \"old city\" of Baku.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nShirvanshahs' bath houses\nList of World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan\nOld City (Baku)\nArchitecture of Azerbaijan\n\n\n== Literature ==\nJonathan M.

          "Azerbaijan is rather difficult to get any kind of travel guide to point you to places of interest. So visiting here was a good start on Azeri history before oil!. Fascinating displays and beautiful buildings, all in the shadow of the Flame towers.",
          "Well worth visiting, the buildings are great, some of the displays could be better. There is a nice atmosphere in the complex. Again lots of staff, staring at phones and totally disinterested.",
          "Along with the Maiden Tower , the Palace is part of the UNESCO World Heritage List of Historical Monuments . Since we had never been disappointed for visiting a World Heritage site , we decided to take the video guide to better learn about the Palace and we were glad to have",
          "Nice place, smoking not allowed. Need to walk too much. Its allowed for children. Ticket price 20 Azb.",
          "It is a nice place but i didn\u2019t find it worth the 10 manats ticket! they somehow ruined the interior of the old palace by adding red partitions and screens it was far from authenticity! The mosque was so dark that you can\u2019t see anything inside. Also they don\u2019t have signs",
          "This palace was the seat of the Shirvanshah when the ruled vast areas of the modern day Azerbaijan. Only a limited part of the premises is open to the public but it is enough to give a glimpse at the reality of life in the palace. As the palace is located in the old district of",
          "The history is interesting, but I don't understand why the entrance fee is so high, especially compared to other attractions in Baku and Azerbaijan. For that price, you'd at least think they'd turn on the air conditioning (there are air conditioners in every room but they all",
          "Its wonderful to stroll around the palace and see all the artifacts and the throne room and learn about the history of the palace. It's very well restored and there is a real pride in it's upkeep from the staff whih resonates through.",
          "I visited the place as I was wandering around old town, Paid 10 Manat for entry ticket, then another 15 Manat for the audio guide that I didnt use because it turned out to be an old Ipad miny, that they dont offer a headset for. The palace is small, and not very exciting.",
          "We had a splendid time there. Very interesting and especially when you know of the ancient history of Azerbeidjan, things connect and fell into place.",
          "it is worth to pay to visit the place - not very cheap, but very historic and beautiful, and located in the Old City",
          "This Palace is not the most impressive of palaces I've seen on this side of the world, however, it's a good attraction in Baku and it's interesting. I would say it's worth a visit. Also, the view of the Flame Towers with the top of old town is very nice.",
          "Great exhibits and so well taken care of. There are some parts that are replicas, the throne room is really well done. Very friendly staff in the gift shop that were feeding my son biscuits :)",
          "Very scenic surroundings, but a small palace. Artifacts, carpets etc all preserved. Very nice model of the old city is there.Could also see the stained glass window of Sheki palace here.",
          "We visited this palace while loitering around in Baku old city.The ticket price is 10 manat per person. The palace is quite small and also doesn't resemble a palace but more like a fort.But this is 1 of the important things to do in old city.There is a lot of history.",
          "Located in the heart of Baku old city the palace was well prepared for visitors. A lot of explanations id offered by monitors in the palace.",
          "The palace is worth a visit while wondering around the old town. The site contains a good range of historical artefacts which add to the experience.",
          "This palace is worth the visit even though it's renovated. To get to know the history hire a local guide.",
          "This site was just ok. Went through it in 15 minutes. More of a small museum with artifacts that didn't interest me. Structure, was historic, but that's about it. Walking around the perimeter will essentially give you the same feeling for less. Frankly, not worth the",
          "I honestly didnt enter as it took long to climb up the hill and it seemed pretty small from the outside foe a palace. Might be worth your time but we just strolled by it",
          "Ammmmmmazing place to visit and get aquainted with the history of the country. Take a guide and just listen.",
          "This is a combination of museum and old buildings. Definitely worth a look as it is a small complex of many buildings with history of Baku.",
          "It is a small palace with a collection of buildings, mostly in good order, with restoration work continuing. Pleasant and interesting exhibits, some very poignant. Set on top of the hill within the Old City, it required a little walk to get there but not arduous. Worth visiting.",
          "Ticket price costs about 1manat per person. One can visit this place even without a tourist guide., sufficient information is provided around the palace. It's a big palace lot of things to see and read but very hot and dark inside the palace . It's a must visit place to see",
          "In the context of Azerbaijan entry fees, 10 manat did not reflect the value of this site in our opinions. Almost without internal decoration this is a plain building that consideration from outside will give you enough of an idea. Should you have the misfortune of going in",
          "Shirvanshah palace is an iconic monument in Baku ,Must visit Located in old city of Baku Diversity of cultural facets which take you back into the era of strong kingdom at that time. Wonderful site",
          "In my opinion this is the BEST thing to see in the Baku Old Town. Its the palace that the old dynasty used to live in for a very short amount of time. I think about 150-200 years. Shows a lot of cultural and historic thing about Azerbaijan. Nothing spectacular but still nice.",
          "It is a small palace/museum compared to the likes of Topkapi and others but do visit if you are near the Old city. It will take hardly 45 mins to cover the whole place. Maybe longer if you choose to take a guide. Be prepared for steep steps and no wheelchair access.",
          "It locates on a hill, which gives it the advantage of a view. Fancy old stuff to find inside. Reflects a historical rich man's lifestyle.",
          "Certainly worth a look at. There are different rooms to explore and an outside part which included a mosque and some baths. The palace is very elegant. There are toilets outside and they have a small shop. In the old town I\u2019d say it was worth looking at.",
          "One of must see places in Baku. It is historical and very interesting place in Ichari Shahar. An hour is enough to see this place",
          "This is a must see within the old city. In some ways I loved it more than the Maiden's Tower, but it is worth seeing both. This attraction is great for examining the beauty of architecture, ancient interiors, and collections of artifacts including musical instruments. Very",
          "Interesting, small palace. 10 manat entry fee - a little expensive for what you get. I should have researched this place before visiting to have got more out of it.",
          "The palace mosque and the palace house (hamam) are worth a visit. This was built by the Shirvanshah dynasty in the 15th century and includes the main building,Diwan Khana, The Masoleum etc",
          "This palace was amazing. built in the heart of old city. You can feel the ancient times here. If you like historical palaces and visit the old city here is a must go.",
          "Price is 10 manat. Palace is located within old city walls. Most interesting part for me was remains of baths",
          "If you are in the old city, it worth the visit! The construction shows how the former royal family used to live there! Price 5,0 manat!",
          "There were a few interesting exhibits here, but it wasn't as well designed or displayed as other museums in the city. It was also a bit of an uphill walk over mostly cobblestones - that might have influenced my opinion. Good views from there.",
          "Well worth a visit, the Palace dates to the era of Persian rule in Azerbaijan and is very near the Maiden Tower. Fortunately it was restored in the 2002 and is a must see site in the walled city.",
          "Well displaced antiquities. Busy area with tourists. need to be able to climb steep steps. Displays in english language.",
          "right on the top of the old city the palace is marvelous structure of architecture and history, with great view from the top and a frame to take a picture just near the gate of the palace, excellent place",
          "There is a lot to see, and if you are a history fan, a lot of information about the Shirvan, who ruled from the mid-9th century to the early 16th century. The museum inside has some interesting artifacts. The palace is fairly large over the centuries extra building have been",
          "Lots of history but not a lot to see. Or maybe we were just tired after a very long flight. We enjoyed the views from the palace garden more than we appreciated the artifacts and relics of the palace.",
          "It a modest size palace but still very much grandeur. Well presented and taken care of by the government. Entrance fee quite cheap. Spend 2-3 hours here and be enchanted by the palace design and walk through.",
          "a symbol of Azeri history gives a glimpse of what it would look like to live centuries back in Baku.",
          "Passed by Shirvanshahs Palace with little information but decided to buy tickets and go in. Minimum 2 hours to cover such a wonderful palace. Many rooms, throne room, tombs, halls, old dress, swords, musical instruments and many more. Beautiful view to the Hamam from the top.",
          "If you want to visit one place in Baku, this is it. Inside there are musuem items to watch, but the building itself is very interesting. Also very beautiful at night. Entrance fee is 10 menat per adults.",
          "Records don't exist from the time of the palace but officials have attempted to recreate the building based on other artifacts and historical accounts. Easy to wander around with signage in English. Some visitors opted for private guide but it's easy enough to visit alone.",
          "A UNESCO Heritage complex. To be honest, I found it very expensive (10 AZN) compared to other sites I've seen before and considering what you see here. Outside the palace though is a great place for taking photos with flame towers in.",
          "Unfortunately it has just a few artfacts but place has a nice and ancient history. It is a must place if you are visiting Kabu. There is room with the makett of the innercity and with some old pictures. If you can act like a lokal just 1 eur.",
          "Very ancient and historical monument. Not a lot of artifacts, however being inside you can feel and imagine how did they live in ancient ages. The palace itself is in a very good condition, the government looks after it. Better to take private guide in order to get a clear",
          "took a guided tour around the Palace ruins last June and the information given on its history was incredible. you can just walk around on your own but for the few pound extra for a guide( only 2 of us in our group) was definitely money well spent. I went back around the outside",
          "just by entering the palace you could feel the amazing aura that is in that place. its where the history of the city starts from. has a lot of great places around it if you want to have food or drinks. one of them is FLOORS and its located right on the side wall of the palace",
          "I would definitely recommend to visit this palace. It was very interesting and very well maintained. We didn't take a tour and just walked through at our own pace. I loved the courtyard. There is also a nice view.",
          "I visited the Palace of the Shrivanshahs in November 2017. There is a small charge of about $5.00 and the whole tour is about 1/2 to 1 hour. The Palace is situated in the old area of Baku on a hilltop surrounded by residences. It was built in 15th century and is",
          "It is in the old city so you will see it when you walk around. It is small because it is old and King was not that rich",
          "Must visit - fairly cheap, beautifully maintained, and interesting to see through the vast palace/museum",
          "This was my second visit with a friend from Australia visiting.. Glad I got to show her around as it would seem I missed out on a whole section of this place the first visit I did... Allow a good couple of hours to take in all the area of the Old City and this beautiful historic",
          "Very good and historical place to be in Baku. The palace built in 15th century by Shirvanshahs government because of the destruction of their capital in Shamakhi in 15th century. Highly recommend to visit",
          "Neglected, inconvenient and not very interesting. Baku authorities could learn from Istanbul experts how to maintain such a place. Charging AZN10 is a rip off for what you get.",
          "Located within the walled old city of Baku. Beautifully restored and maintained. Includes mosque and tombs. English signs/posters explaining exhibitions available.",
          "I especially liked how hands off the entire museum is. It explains the history of the place well, and why it lost a part of it grandeur, but it mostly let's you explore at you own pace.",
          "The palace of the shirvanshahs is one of the most important sites in azerbaijan, right in the middle of the old city and very well restaured it gives you a feel of life between 12 and 15 century. It is on three levels and cannot be missed",
          "Old city has its own palace, so fit it in. Once again the tourist attractions charge more us foreigners, however worth the \u00a35. Interesting objects to view.",
          "The Palace occupies the upper, elevated part of the walled Old city. It's not such a big place as one would expect from a Royal palace. Entry fee is 10 manat (5 euros). The complex dates back to 15 cent and consists of royal living chambers, a mosque, private mausoleum and",
          "A tour guide is essential to understand more and know more. I love how people with guide books trying to self-tour always try to sneak into our tour groups. The palace with the mosque and baths inside is one of the highlights of Baku and shouldnt be missed.",
          "10 AZN no photography fee, tripod allowed Museum with artefacts and information boards, nice staff, toilets (two) available, not very big but size is right enough for some casual stroll. The flame tower looks nice from inside this palace and you can always find a quiet spot away",
          "Amazing place..you an still see the havan kunds...strange to be found there..miles from our home land with a trishul.",
          "Many people travel around world to know and see historical place and caltuer of countries so this place can give you many information about this part of Azarbjan and also many nice icon and old things show there even some of them not original one ....",
          "This is a very underwhelming ruins of a palace in the old city of Baku. While the tourists flock here in large groups, I think there is absolutely no reason to visit, unless you are a true history buff. There are much nicer looking buildings in the old town to enjoy.",
          "Beautiful palace structure dating from the middle of the 15th century. Small but some beautiful mosaics.",
          "We were here as part of walking tour. It\u2019s a small palace. The collection doesn\u2019t really belong to to Shah . A few things were worth noticeable. There is a flow which tells about the Shah\u2019s family and descendants.",
          "It is a simple palace, unlike the mosaic and glitter of central Asian types. The museum is well worth the visit, well kept and good detailing of Bayil fort which was discovered when the Caspian sea waters receeded. Amazing royal baths. Well maintained , worth a visit .",
          "Have to visit this. Tell everything about the history. Story is better than the artifacts. Lots to see.",
          "Beautiful, enchanting, clean, historic and well worth the minimal entrance fee. Many exhibits, explained full in English as well.",
          "Nothing special! It is not even a palace!You will be charged 0.2 AZN if you are a student . The only part I found interesting is the musical instruments and the description",
          "Most interesting museum and sight I saw in Azerbaijan. It's easy to find and well worth the investment, I believe it was 5 euro to enter. Inside very nice exhibitions of carpets, pottery, swords and daggers. You'll need about an hour to see everything. I was happy I visited the",
          "It was a great experience. Lovely guided tour, comprehensive English of the lady. Provided a great insight into the history of the region. Thank you!",
          "Interesting place for those who enjoy history. We went around by ourselves and it was still enjoyable as we could read the English signs. Guide is probably optional and for personal preference :)",

          "Located in Old City Baku, Shervanshah Palace is a nice daytime activity. The ticket is only like ten manat and for an additional price, you can get an audio or in person tour guide. And although you can roam around on your own and read the information plaques but it is highly",
          "This is located in the old city which is definitely worth a visit. The palace itself has a lot of history and there are boards located around the area telling stories of the past. I'm not sure if you have to pay to get in, there is a ticket box but they didn't ask me get a",
          "I was looking for a huge Palace with big towers but finally I found an average size of historical building with museum inside. Ticket price (2017.09) costs 10 Manats - and in my opinion there was nothing interesting inside. That was only my opinion, because I've met few people",
          "In comparison place I have visited in Iran it was very simple one.nothing special inside & not an extraordinary architectuary bulding.but the way of going to shah palace is interseting you can see caspian sea in the top.for one time visiting is acceptable but nothing more",
          "Great museum to visit in the Old Town of Baku. It is fully restored and the exhibits are well labeled. I didn't take the audio guide and it was not needed. Interesting exhibits, very informative, I did enjoy it!",
          "I'm afraid this place did not see me in the way that a Rajasthani palace or a Madrasah in Samarkand did. Still, it is a nice complex showing interesting exhibits. It was very tranquil in the garden between the mosque and the mausoleum. Beautiful flowers",
          "For being one the most attractive site in Baku, there's nothing very special to see here. It's obviously all renewed, but it appear like a fake new. Walls and rooms are often empty, and when there is something to show, is very boring (carpet, pot...). Half an hour for a complete",
          "If you are interested in the history of the region and fantastic architecture, the place is for you. Interactive displays, ancient artefacts, stunning buildings, explanations in three languages - all these make the Palace a very comfortable place to visit.",

          "The place is arrange perfectly, the building was from the 15th century but combined the modernization on this place. You can find the museum inside, that let you know what happened in the pass. Not only that, some tombs are still there and their locations are separate each",
          "The Shirvanshas Palace is intersting from an architectural standpoint, and it's interesting to watch the architectural details with the 21st century buildings, such as the Flame Towers, in th background. There are plenty of artifacts on exhibit, if you are into things like",
          "This palace is simplistic and heterologous with other palaces same as topcapy in istanbul but it is nice and help us to know better azerbaijan past history.",

          "This is located in Old Town. There is an entrance fee + can get a guide for a price. Interesting palace with a few artifacts and a gift shop. Like most places, it is well kept and preserved.",

          "Interesting architecture and also quite rich collection (but the collection items are relatively new, dating 19th century mostly). Just beware of the scammers trying to 'help' you and get you through the back gate of the complex into the area with mosque and shah's mausoleum",

          "A large complex but sadly you need to use quite a bit of imagination since so much of the interior of the buildings no longer exists. Given this, they have done a good job with various exhibits in the rooms. If you have been to Topkapi in Istanbul it felt similar.",

          "Palace of the Shirvanshahs is located in the Old City just a short walk from the Maiden Tower. Its not jaw dropping but worth a visit for the historical content. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial-vaults, the shah's mosque with a",
          "Interesting and I recommend to visit, doesn't have the wow factor but interesting in understanding the history",
          "A nice example of an old palace altogether with few museum pieces such jewellery, pottery etc. Do it with a local guide (for extra 10 manats - but we got the guide even without asking) because only with her (we had a girl - she was excellent!!) you can understand what had served",
          "This is really worth doing. The architecture is stunning, You can get a private guide to show you round for around \u00a36 and that is really worth it. Lovely views of the city as well.",

          "Impressive architecture but for some reason I was reminded of the prison from midnight express and the computer game prince of persia in there. Didnt stay too long but my main purpose of my visit was to find a good view to take some city skyline pics from as its reasonably high",

          "This palace is in the old town and you can buy a separate ticket go inside, or use with a combined ticket to go in various places of interest inside the old town. It is high up in the old town and interesting to visit, as was the Maiden Tower low down in the old town.",
          "Baku was an important enclave since early the 11th century and the Shirvanshahs was one of the most important and powerful dynasties of the Caucasian era for a couple of centuries and the extent and quality of this palace gives credit to it. Nice architecture good interactive",
          "Very nice and lots of information inside in Azeri and English (maybe also Russian). You can sit and relax in the courtyards and have a nice view to different parts of the town, especially to the flame towers.",
          "Well it looks very old from outside, but inside you will understand, that the ruins were completely renovated, restored, we asked the guide, and the reason is that Russian Tzar had burned the city. Nice to see it.",
          "Just not to miss anything within the IcheryShahar. Not many emotions: similar palacies in Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan are more impressive with picturesque mosaik and outstanding hand craft work",
          "I was so impressed with the Palace, with the architecture and the stone. But, the stairs were most appealing to me. My friend and me were wondering how tall people had to be to climb to one of those stairs. :D Definitely worth visiting if you want to feel some of rich",
          "Maybe a little short on historical detail but interesting nevertheless. A lot of it is restored edifices but done well. We took a guided tour in English.",
          "We spend an hour wondering through the rooms and gardens of the palace. There isn't a great deal of artefacts there, but what is there is beautifully displayed. The restoration of the entire complex is really worth seeing, I thought it was an excellent example of a well restored",
          "Maybe it is because I had the chance to visit much more artifact rich museums in various cities, this museum looked a bit poor to my taste. Still it is a nice place to see and understand how the history shaped this ancient city.",
          "I paid the extra (approx \u00a33.50) and had a personal guide in English. She was friendly, warm, took my individualistic questions and carved out a really lovely visit for me. Architecturally and historically the palace is interesting and my guide made it all live. It's a shame to",

          "Beautifully persevered palace of the sultans. Complete with his living quarters, mosque, sitting area, etc. You get a great view of the city as well since it's built on a hill. Great for anyone interesting in the history of the region.",
          "This historic monument gives you the chance to review the history of Baku and Azerbaijan in beautiful historic surroundings. The entrance fee was only about US$2.00 and an audio guide cost $5.00. The Audio Guide comes with an iPad, so it is a bit awkward to carry around if you",
          "Shirvanshah's Palace is the place that everyone should see in Baku. I would rank it up at the top of \"must see\" list because you can easily feel the immense influence of Persian background everywhere . The palace dates back to 15th century and contains several buildings. My",
          "If you are in Baku, you really must use your chance and visit Palace of the Shirvanshahs. Its all renovated, museum has a very good and modern equipment. The architecture and craftsmanship is quite impressive also. Gives you many information, how was daily life in old Baku.",
          "Located within the City Walls this is an attraction not to be missed. You can see all the ruins and learn a lot about the past",
          "Like all palaces - this is worth a visit. An ancient palace - maybe empty of any artifacts/decor but worth to stroll around and see what great grandeur it was. There are also a small shop inside where you can take pictures of yourself wearing a traditional clothes (I recommend",
          "Within the city walls a small but interesting Palace of the Kings. ..beautifully restored building....",
          "Very interesting place. The guide was very professional and kind, I learned quite a lot from this visit.",
          "We get there in the middle of the hot day during the summer and after reaching the place we felt nothing like walking around any further. But we got tickets and asked for English guide. The girl was great, she explained us everything, all the exhibit on display, told all stories",
          "Very interesting palace. Need to spend at least two hours in a guided tower that scheduled at the palace reception.",
          "A very pretty palace. Would be best to have a tour guide available, as there is not a lot of information in the guide books. Through its thorough restoration you get a good feeling of how it used to be. Not a lot of visitors when I was there, apparently being the high season re",
          "The day I went the main entrance was closed so you had to go through another entrance which wasn't well marked and the person selling tickets was at lunch so they let me look around until she came back.",
          "This is extraordinary palace to visit. Very old with many rooms and artifacts. You will love the model of the palace to realize how big this attraction is.",
          "Interesting palace inside narrow streets of old city center. You need to take guided tour, otherwise it's hard to understand the sence",
          "The Palace of the Shirvanshahs is a contained enclave within the Old City. It contains a mosque, tombs, excavated bats,, the old servants area and the main palace itself. It also has a photo shop where one may dress up in old style clothing for a photograph. Within the main",
          "Quite interesting, with the baths, temple and others. In the old city so part of the wander through. There were some interesting displays with some English",
          "Admittedly a lot of the the buildings and site has been rebuilt and refurbished in recent times, so what you actually end up looking at isn\u2019t truly original, however for the nominal amount of two Manet it is totally worth the visit. More than that, I would recommend upgrading",
          "Right in the heart of the Old Town - not easily accessible for elderly people of for small kids because of the many steps. However, it worth visiting, great atmosphere.",
          "It's a nicely done palace, however most it is rebuilt completely anew, which makes it a bit awkward. Our guide was also quite mediocre.",
          "The architecture is beautiful, however most of it is not original, with it being restored and changed quite regularly. Bearing this in mind though, it is still a fascinating place to visit, nestled in the heart of Old City. I am in two minds about recommending a tour guide,",
          "Little has changed in the 11 years since my last visit other than the attitude of the locals which can be no bad thing..... Now very European and significantly more expensive but the charm remains unchanged. Well worth a short visit en-route to one of Baku's many superb",
          "My only problem with this palace is that most of it, if not all has been reconstructed. So nobody is really sure how it looked. The best are the carved stones that were found at the Bayil castle.",
          "very interesting place with a lot of exhibits to see. located in the middle of old Baku, surrounded with narrow streets, feels like a time traveling",
          "This is the main palace from old Azerbaijan. I found it smaller than I expected. Interesting architecture in the old city of Baku. Avoid visiting noon in summer time as it can be very hot. Better to visit in the afternoon.",
          "For those who do not like history, it might be boring, but is you are interested in what is happened hundreds of years ago and how the Baku people have been leaving before, it is worth it to go for a guid tour. There are few small exhibitions inside the palace. You can also",
          "Ancient but well preserved monument to the past, which is likely to be guided through....Then, you will find out a lot of interesting and useful info.",
          "This is the old Palace where the Shah lived in the 12th century and it's beautifully restored to its former glory. You get a good glimpse of what life would have been like living here. It also overlooks the old town and the Flame Towers in the distance. It only costs 2 manats",
          "The Palace of the Shirvanshahs is a beautiful place to learn about the history of Baku, and admire some of the most impressive architecture in the Old City. The museum is very informative, and the palace itself has been beautifully restored. Though the rooms themselves may be",
          "Very interesting place but the day i visited was really hot and there is hardly any shelter around. Poor ventilation inside the palace. Felt that i was melting. There is a photo booth where they charge u for about 10man to take photos in their traditional costumes. Worth a visit",
          "Interesting, and an essential part of wandering in the old city. Best to have a guide - see the kiosk near the MaidenTower.They will take you throughout the old city, including this palace. Be wary of restaurant recommendations from guides, as in any city - they are likely to be",
          "If you like old palace buildings, this one is interesting although not furnished. An explanation is needed to understand what the rooms were for. Guides who speak English you can understand area hard to find. Do not go if you have trouble with stairs.",
          "Yes, you have to pay, but so many things in the city are free, just do it. It is an incredible collection of the best the city has to offer. If Rameeza is your guide, she will be able to access areas not generally open on the tour. You can do the tour on your own as",
          "The entry fee is only 2 AZN, which is about what it's worth. The facility is largely a reconstruction and there is not much posted to tell you about the complex or its history. I didn't spring for a guide, and what I heard from others wandering around the site convinced me I",
          "I would suggest the 2 manat entry fee and doing the tour on your own. There are little signs everywhere telling you what is what and what you are seeing behind the glass cases. Not terribly exciting and don't plan on too much time being spent here either. Carve out a half hour",
          "IMHO must visit place, the bird's eye of Old City. Despite there's no internal decorations inside (apparently it was stolen/taken a long ago, and some of the pieces could be found in Istanbul and St. Petersburg museums) it is very impressing. One of the best samples of stone",
          "Baku has some very interesting history but this palace has some of the most interesting. Give yourself plenty time to enjoy the 40 minute tour. Loved it! It is quite tricky to find but super cheap to get in, only 8 manat with the tour included, 2 if you dont want the tour but",
          "very pleasant visit in old city excellent to get a clear perspective fantastic exhibition in the palace with some modern technology very clean place and also very safe even late at night some nice restaurants around overall very nice experience",
          "As a building is very well maintained but the content inside is very poor besides the efforts to show the history with the use of techology.I n other words not so many things to expose and show to the tourists..",
          "5 manat seemed a bit steep but it turned out to be a guided tour, with a guide who was most knowledgeable and could answer all sorts questions about Azeri history so even though the weather was awful we had an excellent time. The tour takes about an hour.",
          "Great place to know more about old baku, how it has changed, previous Kings and governors and their way of living. A must-see place for every one who is interested in the history of this area",
          "This visit was an unexpected pleasure. Again I beat all the schoolclasses and I could enjoy the serenity of this complex. They even reaped a pomegranate from one of the trees and left it to me. Downstairs in the garden I enjoyed the warmth of the sun.",
          "Too bad those who are in charge of money dispersals didn't give more for this palace and take, just a few million from the overspending on the silly flame towers. The building, although overly reconstructed, is quite authentic looking, and would be enhanced with some cool stuff",
          "There is not much to see, and it's better to take a guide so that you have and idea what you are looking at. This palace is also overrenewed and lost its ancient charm due to this rennovation. But the ticket price is not expencive so why not to visit then?",
          "Really nice visit, the palace is absolutely great and is worth to spend some time walking around the different areas. There are some restorated rooms but, in my opinion, the exterior areas will capture you.",
          "very nice grounds and museum, beautifully renovated, with nicely curated exhibits and excellent views. Fascinating to see the Flame Towers in the distance - expressing this stark contrast of old and new city development.",
          "It's a very clean and quaint place, though much smaller than what I had expected. The guide was most helpful in showing all the exhibits and telling the stories associated with the palace. It takes barely 40 minutes to cover the place at a leisurely pace",
          "Even if you are not a historian, this palace is absolutely worth the time and money you spent. And if you have a guide like ours, it gives you an inside and in-depth view of Azerbaidjan. Not only the past, but also the present. The palace is renovated, but of course the",
          "This beautiful limestone palace in the Old City dates back to the 15th century and looks fantastic at night, when it is artfully lit. Admission is free.",
          "well it reminded me a lot of the Mughal Architecture you find in India.. the Diwan khana.. the Dome and the carvings on the wall and ceilings... much smaller to what i have seen in India but it was worth the visit for me to realise the the world is small.. dint expect to hear",
          "The entrance fee is minimal (2 manats is about \u00a31.50) and for that you get access to a sprawling site of ancient (but over-restored) buildings packed with exhibitions about history, art and archaeology - stone carvings from a castle that was washed away when the Caspian Sea rose",
          "2 manat entrance fee plus extra if you are after a guide. Chose to pay a visit based on the reviews here, but turned out to be overrated and disappointment. There is not much history left to the place and majority of the palace has been restored quite recently and has lost its",
          "If you are interested in history especially of the Caucasus this is a must. The palace is not big but very interesting to see. The complex was build in 15th century for the Shirvans who transferred the capital from Shemakha to Baku. The role of the Shirvanshah state was",
          "The main palace was still on restoration when we visited so we walked around it with our guide. The place itself is quite big and interesting. Its different culture so was quite unique for us. Ancient ornaments and hammas each with its own history, great stairs and nice small",
          "Entrance fee is 2 AZN, but ticket seller has added 2 AZN as a charge of a photograph. And she handed me the used ticket. Probably injustice is performed. Maiden tower is not collecting the photography fee. Please confirm an entrance fee before entry.",
          "Another must-see attraction in the old town is this palace. Entrance fee is equivalent of 2 euro, take care that you see where to pay, otherwise you might get chased for the payment. The palace itself is for the moment open only with one of its levels. There are so,e pictures,",
          "The place is not for people who seeks adrenolin flow in blood stream. It is rather small and without any magnificent features or construction. It is for people who would like to sence the history going back to XII century. Very nice place to visit when it is not very hot",
          "The place itself is ok, surrounded by the beautiful old city, but very limited number of things to see inside. Also: when I went there were some man at work in one of the courtiards at the back, and also the apartment were not accessible",
          "On the day we visited some of the complex was closed for renovations but it was still an interesting place to wander around. We probably only needed 30 minutes to walk around the tomb, courtyard (my favourite part), hammam and mosque.",
          "It's must visit destination, if you are going to Azerbaijan. Historical with great monuments from Caucasus period, that isn't well explored by many travelers and covered poor by Western media.",

          "It is a must to visit Shirvanshahs Palace to feel and know Azeri history. Well organised museum in Old Baku.",
          "Beautiful architecture, mosque, mausoleum and Turkish baths discovered amongst one of the more recent reconstructions. All built in pale Baku stone, very picturesque and interesting. It's therefore a real pity the interiors aren't more decorated and made to a more of an exhibit.",
          "Visiting the palace of the Shirvanshahs is a must. It is recommended to book an English speaking guide who provides you with all the background information needed to understand the importance of the building and the surroundings. My family enjoyed it and it completed our Old",
          "This palace, built in the 15th century, is a great example of Azerbaijani architecture. Within the walled city, it features a courtyard, monuments, a mausoleum, a mosque and minaret. There is also a small museum inside displaying period furniture, clothing, rugs, etc. There",
          ".....not a lot to see. Very few exhibits, lots of empty rooms, and fairly well restored. It is definitely NOT worth paying for even at the modest prices. I have no objection to paying entrance fees to a museum, but you expect to be able see and experience something vaguely",
          "Be sure yiu vivit the bath section of the Palace. One can see there how the heating of the baths system was orgainsed trough undergroud hot air. Fabolous!",
          "Fortunately surrounded by Old town, Palace is a very nice building but not as impressive as other things in Azerbaijan... the museography could be better and the building looks empty... i mean, they could show more interesting things (i\u00b4m very sure they have) about Shirvanshahs",
          "If you have seen the palaces in India or in rest of the middle east, the Shirvanshah palace is very average. The entry fee is modest (2 manat). Nothing special in the attraction though...No harm in visiting the site if you have time to kill..",
          "Admission was less than $5.00 with a photo permit, and there was a whole lot to see. The toilets were a little hard to find.",
          "Fascinating to see how these rulers lived so many years ago and how advanced they were in architectural deign and construction techniques. None of our contemporary buildings will be standing for visitors to admire hundreds of years from no.",
          "Beutifully restored, this palace complex oozes of the rich history of Baku.The palace apartments, small mosques, mauselum and hamam are located in a compact space, helping us walk through the pristine palace that echoed the past glory of the Azerbaijan rulers. Even tho\u00fagh part",
          "It is relatively small and you have to wind your way around to see it but a touch of the ancient within view of the ultra modern soaring glass towers. Not much is labeled but you get a flavor that it was opulent in it's own time. Worth a visit if you are wandering through the",
          "Really beautiful old building. Was lovely to walk around and be surrounded by the history of it all. But, not a lot of descriptions on the various rooms, carpets, artifacts etc. Great place for photos.",
          "Interesting to see though not much is left especially from the palace. Baths are great as well as historical exposition inside the palace.",
          "You definetely should try and visit Shirvashahs Palace in the Old Town. It has a museum inside, a courtyard, a mosque. In general if you would like to know a bit of the history of Azerbaijan, definetely should see it.",
          "It's a stunning gem but over restored in some of the main areas - fitted out like a modern office block.",
          "As well as the stone buildings which make up this complex, there are many stones with inscriptions and statuary arranged in the courtyards. Apparently, these were largely rescued from an island in the Caspian which has now again fallen below the water level.",
          "This really atmospheric palace deserve a visit if you're in Baku. The inside is almost void but architecture and environment can bring you back to past and dreamy ages. It is also worth seeing the external walls at night while hanging around downtown",
          "The palace is nice and ancient although renovation works are evident. It's better to take a guide or private excursion to get the full information and some interesting facts from the palace's history. The entrance fee is 2 Manats (2 Eur) and 2 Manats if you want to take photos.",
          "Soviet-style 'hospitality' including rude guides and awkward presentation methods (including brand new 'ancient' artefacts) but otherwise a must for everyone visiting Baku. 2 manat fee for camera use!",

For this performance he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946. He remained with this theatre until 1951. Later, he toured extensively all over the Soviet Union while having long time engagements with the Odessa Opera and Ballet theater and the Baku Opera and Ballet Theatre. He retired from stage in 1964 during his engagement with the Moldova Opera Theater but returned to the same theater for his farewell performance in Otello in 1968.\nAzrikan was also the stage director of several opera productions in which he also sang the leading roles.

        "wiki": "Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum (Azerbaijani: Az\u0259rbaycan Milli Xal\u00e7a Muzeyi, formerly called the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum) is a museum located in Baku that displays Azerbaijani carpets and rugs of various weaving techniques and materials from various periods. It has the largest collection of Azerbaijani carpets in the world.\nIt moved to a new building on the Baku's seafront park during 2014 from its former location on Neftchiler Avenue.Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum was established in accordance with the decree No. 130 of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR dated March 13, 1967. From 1967 to 1993, the museum was called the Azerbaijan State Museum of Carpet and Folk Applied Arts, from 1993 to 2014 \u2013 State Museum of Carpet and Applied Arts named after Latif Karimov, from 2014 to 2019 \u2013 Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, and from 2019 to the present \u2013 Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum was established in 1967 and was initially located in the Juma Mosque in Icheri Sheher. The mosque was built in the 15th century and renovated in the 19th century. Its first exhibition was held in 1972. In 1992, after the collapse of USSR, the museum was moved to the second floor of what is now the Baku Museum Center, a building that had originally been the Lenin museum. The collection was named in honour of the carpet designer Latif Karimov.\nPlans to move the collection to a new purpose-built venue have been in the works since 2010 when Azerbaijani carpets were proclaimed \"a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage\" by UNESCO.\nThe new building was due to open in late 2012 and was visited by President Ilham Aliyev in September 2013. The museum opened on 26 August 2014. In April 2014 the museum was renamed the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, dropping its much longer official title.Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum was established in accordance with the decree No. 130 of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR dated March 13, 1967. From 1967 to 1993, the museum was called the Azerbaijan State Museum of Carpet and Folk Applied Arts, from 1993 to 2014 \u2013 State Museum of Carpet and Applied Arts named after Latif Karimov, from 2014 to 2019 \u2013 Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, and from 2019 to the present \u2013 Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum.\nAt the time of establishing, it was the only museum that was dedicated to the art of carpet weaving. The main purpose of the museum's creation was to store, research, and demonstrate unique examples of the carpet weaving art, which are Azerbaijan's national heritage. The initiator of the museum was Latif Karimov, the outstanding scientist and carpet weaver, founder of the science of Azerbaijan Carpet Art, artist and teacher, author of the fundamental work Azerbaijani Carpet.\nThe first permanent exhibition was presented on April 26, 1972, in the building of the Juma Mosque, an architectural monument of the 19th century, located in Icherisheher (Old City). The national leader of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, who provided great support to the museum from the first days of its establishment, took part at the opening ceremony. In 1970\u20131980s, with the constant help of the country's leadership in the person of Heydar Aliyev, Museum had regular opportunities to purchase crafts and thereby replenish its collections. In those years, masterpieces of Azerbaijani Carpet Weaving Art were purchased for the museum.\nIn 1992, the State Museum of Carpet and Applied Arts was moved to the Museum Center (former Lenin Museum), located at the Neftchilar Avenue. In 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to the presidential decree, the building was given to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Azerbaijan and renamed to Museum Center. The museum exhibition, representing the carpet samples from different regions of Azerbaijan, as well as works of other kinds of applied arts, was located in thirteen spacious rooms on the second floor.\nIn 2007, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed a decree for the creation of a new building for the museum in the territory of Seaside National Park within the framework of a joint project of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and UNESCO. In 2014, under the direction of Austrian architect Franz Janz, the museum building, which meets all modern requirements, was completed. Over the years, the museum is continuously developed and has become one of the main storage of samples of the Azerbaijan national culture.\nThroughout its fifty years, the museum was led by several directors. From 1967 to 1982, it was led by Aziz Aliyev, Honored Art Worker; from 1982 to January 5, 2016 \u2013 by Professor Roya Tagiyeva, Honored Cultural Worker, Doctor in Arts. Since March 2, 2016, the museum has been headed by Dr. Shirin Melikova, Honored Cultural Worker.\nThe museum has become a research, training, cultural and educational center where many events, such as exhibitions, international symposiums, and conferences, are held. During its fifty years of existence, the museum has organized more than thirty exhibitions in different countries throughout the world. In 1983, on the initiative of Heydar Aliyev and the organizational support of UNESCO, the international symposium Art of Oriental Carpets was held in the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum. Later, international symposiums such as Azerbaijan Carpet Weaving Art (1988), and Azerbaijan Carpet and Applied Arts (2003) were held within the participation of the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum. Additionally, in 2007, a symposium dedicated to Latif Karimov's centenary was held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris.\nThe museum cooperates closely with influential international organizations, such as the European Textile Network (ETN), the European Museum Forum (EMF), the International Council of Museums (ICOM), UNESCO, and the Council for Humanitarian Cooperation of the Member States of the CIS (IFESCO).\nIn 2004, a law On the Preservation and Development of Azerbaijani Carpet was prepared and adopted within the museum's participation. This law was aimed to implement the registration of Azerbaijani carpets, protect and support their development, and coordinate scientific and methodical training.\nIn 2010, the Traditional Azerbaijan Carpet Weaving Art was included within the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on the initiative of Mehriban Aliyeva, First Vice-President of Azerbaijan, President of Heydar Aliyev Foundation, member of Milli Majlis (National Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan), and Goodwill Ambassador of UNESCO and ISESCO.\nAzerbaijan Carpet Museum in accordance with the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated July 15, 2019, received the National status for its significant contribution in popularization and promotion of the Azerbaijani Carpet Weaving Art.\nToday, Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, which is located in one of the country's most modern buildings, not only stores a rich collection of artifacts and carpets (our nation's most valuable heritage), but also operates as the site for the comprehensive research of traditional carpet weaving art and its popularization within the world culture.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe structure of the building is intended to look like a rolled carpet. Designed by Austrian architect Franz Janz, the building took over six years to construct. The previous structure, a building of historical significance, was destroyed to make way for the new building.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe collection of the museum includes over 10,000 items of ceramics, metal works of the 14th century, jewellery from the Bronze Age, carpets and carpet items from the 17th-20th centuries, national garments and embroidery, and applied art works of the Modern Age. \nThe museum organizes public lectures and study courses on carpets and applied arts. It has a book store selling books on Azerbaijani crafts and carpet art. The museum also holds a permanent collection from the Shusha Museum of History, from the city of Shusha, which was looted after occupation by Armenian troops in 1992. Some of the exhibited items of the Shusha museum were saved when the director of the museum moved out 600 carpets before occupation. They are now displayed at the museum in an exhibition titled \"Burned Culture\".\n\n\n== International exhibitions ==\nThe museum does research and public service work. Every year, state and international exhibitions are organized and catalogues on carpets are printed by the museum. The museum has also held exhibitions in more than 30 countries including France, Germany, England, Japan, the Netherlands. In 1998, the museum participated in a UNESCO-organized exhibition in Paris dedicated to Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee and in 1999 dedicated to the 1,300th anniversary of the Book of Dede Korkut and displayed carpets, folk applied art items, including copper jugs, mugs, buckets and saddle-bags.\n\n\n== Admissions & Ticketing ==\n\n\n=== Working time ===\nWeekdays: Tuesday-Friday \u2013 10 am.- 6 pm.\nWeekends: Saturday-Sunday \u2013 10 am.- 8 pm.\nDay off is Monday.\n\n\n=== Entrance fee ===\nTicket for adults is 7 AZN, for pupils and students is 3 AZN.\nTicket for children under 6 years is free.\n\n\n=== Address ===\nBaku, Mikay\u0131l Huseynov av., 28\n(+994) 12-497-20-57 \n\n\n== See also ==\nAzerbaijan State Museum of Art\nAzerbaijan State Museum of History\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Azerbaijani, English, and Russian)\nAzerbaijan Carpet Museum at Google Cultural Institute\nAzerbaijani Carpets\nCarpet Weaving in Azerbaijan",

Since 1450, it is home to the University of Barcelona, widely considered the most prestigious university in Spain. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many international sport tournaments.\nBarcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Barkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as , in ancient Greek sources as \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, Barkin\u1e53n; and in Latin as Barcino, Barcilonum and Barcenona.Some older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC, but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, Barcino, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Bar\u00e7alona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.\nInternationally, Barcelona's name is wrongly abbreviated to 'Bar\u00e7a'. However, this name refers only to FC Barcelona, the football club. The common abbreviated form used by locals is Barna.\nAnother common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\nThe city is also referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan, and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e. Comital City or City of Counts), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nThe origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been \nfound, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological Hercules. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC, but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.\n\n\n=== Roman Barcelona ===\nIn about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the contemporary city hall (Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia, or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive.\n\nImportant Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla\u00e7a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri G\u00f2tic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral. The cathedral, known very formally by the long name of Catedral Bas\u00edlica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan. It is said to have been founded in 343.\n\n\n=== Medieval Barcelona ===\nThe city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Arabs in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.\nThe Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of Catalonia, although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor. The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved. In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century.\nBarcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia. It initially fed from eastern and balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona (Taula de canvi), probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).\n\n\n=== Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy ===\nThe marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the two royal lines. Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism, including the Catalan Revolt (1640\u201352) against Philip IV of Spain. The great plague of 1650\u20131654 halved the city's population.\n\nIn the 18th century, a fortress was built at Montju\u00efc that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9chain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre. The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve.\n\n\n=== The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period ===\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivised by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'\u00e9tat was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished, and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n=== Late twentieth century ===\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nThe death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government. Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla in the city, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nBarcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Bes\u00f2s river to the north. This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi), of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi) are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\nTibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 metres or 876 feet), Putget (181 metres or 594 feet) and Rovira (261 metres or 856 feet). The escarpment of Montju\u00efc (173 metres or 568 feet), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montju\u00efc Castle, a fortress built in the 17\u201318th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montju\u00efc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.\nThe city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a maritime Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers, while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas such as the Po Valley (e.g. Milan), whose rainfall is greater in summer, a feature of continental climates.\nIts average annual temperature is 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F) during the day and 15.1 \u00b0C (59.2 \u00b0F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) during the day, 6 to 12 \u00b0C (43 to 54 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 \u00b0C (81 to 88 \u00b0F) during the day, about 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months \u2013 April and November \u2013 are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of 18\u201319 \u00b0C (64\u201366 \u00b0F) during the day and 11\u201313 \u00b0C (52\u201355 \u00b0F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent.\nBarcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (\u2265 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September\u2013November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June\u2013August), with a secondary winter minimum (February\u2013March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1 January 2016 was 1,608,746 people, on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 square kilometres (246 square miles) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000. It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\nIn 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people, which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.\n\n\n=== Population density ===\n\nNote: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.\nBarcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.\nIn the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montju\u00efc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 square kilometres (20 square miles) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.\nOf the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n\n\n=== Age structure ===\nIn 1900 almost a third (28.9 percent) were children (aged younger than 14 years), In 2017 this age group constituted only 12.7; those aged between 15 and 24 years in 2017 were 9 percent; those aged between 25 and 44 years a 30.6 percent. In contrast, in 2017 the aged between 45 and 64 years formed the 56.9% of all Barcelonans; while in 1900 the aged 65 and older were just the 6.5 percent, in 2017 reached a 21.5.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nIn 2016 about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506). Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines. There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMost of the inhabitants state they are Roman Catholic (208 churches). In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCat\u00f3lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic. This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians. The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined. In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion. A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain). In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim, which makes 5.6% of total population.\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city. There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations), and Eastern Orthodox.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== General information ===\n\nThe Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to \u20ac28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009. Barcelona city had a very high GDP of \u20ac80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat. Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009.Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle. Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities\u2122 Global Index.Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential, by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.\n\n\n=== Trade fair and exhibitions ===\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona \u2013 the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\nAn important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour.\nThe city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nBarcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011. By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its Rambles, Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016 including 35 five star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.\nDue to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]\". To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a \u20ac30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success.\", he said. \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".\n\n\n=== Manufacturing sector ===\nIndustry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region, with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production. The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Art\u00e9s de Arcos, Balandr\u00e1s, Baradat-Esteve, Bisc\u00fater, J. Castro, Cl\u00faa, David, Delf\u00edn, D\u00edaz y Grill\u00f3, Ebro trucks, Edis, Elizalde, Autom\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, Eucort, Fenix, F\u00e1brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, F\u00e1brica Espa\u00f1ola de Autom\u00f3viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Hurac\u00e1n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Autom\u00f3viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Autom\u00f3viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Partia, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-Espa\u00f1a, Industrias Salvador, Siata Espa\u00f1ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Autom\u00f3viles Victoria, Manufacturas Mec\u00e1nicas Aleu.Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city. The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought \u20ac100 m to the city in just three days.Since 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, has been held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milano and before Berlin in 2015.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nAs the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelon\u00e8s comarca (district).\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006. According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.\n\nThe Comissi\u00f3 de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.\n\nThe executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.The seat of the city council is on the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.\nAfter 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish):\n\nCiutat Vella\nEixample\nSants-Montju\u00efc\nLes Corts\nSarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi\nGr\u00e0cia\nHorta-Guinard\u00f3\nNou Barris\nSant Andreu\nSant Mart\u00edThe districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBarcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these is the University of Barcelona (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and the newer Pompeu Fabra University, and, in the private sector the EADA Business School founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.\n\nThe city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades).\nThe language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue. It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente.\nThe major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers.\nYearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like El Pais (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Qu\u00e8 (all bilingual).\nBarcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions).\nSeveral major FM stations include Catalunya R\u00e0dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV stations, BTV, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, in Barcelona's metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.\n\nFC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the second richest in the world. It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. It is the only male football team in the world to win six trophies in a calendar year (in 2009). FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.\n\nBarcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narc\u00eds Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500.\nBarcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.\n\nSeveral road running competitions are organised year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Merc\u00e8, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and the San Silvestre. There's also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 kilometres (53 miles) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat God\u00f3, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each Christmas, a swimming race across the port is organised. Near Barcelona, in Montmel\u00f3, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.\n\n\n=== Squatter's Movement ===\nBarcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists. Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services. The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu. Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nBarcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) from the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend. It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\nSome low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013. The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south.\n\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a most important Mediterranean turnaround base. In 2013, 3,6 million of pleasure cruises passengers used services of the Port of Barcelona.The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums \u2013 Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n=== National and international rail ===\n\nBarcelona is a major hub for RENFE, the Spanish state railway network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.\nRENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.\n\n\n=== Metro and regional rail ===\n\nBarcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\nIn addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nThe city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambes\u00f2s, are operated by TRAMMET. A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.\n\n\n=== Funicular and cable car ===\nBarcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montju\u00efc up Montju\u00efc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, which serves Montju\u00efc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebasti\u00e0 over the port.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\nThe Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\n\nBarcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolit\u00e0 del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.On 22 March 2007, Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station. The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nBarcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60.\nThe city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.\nThe city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Gl\u00f2ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Barri G\u00f2tic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015, completion is planned for 2026.Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details.\" The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.\nBarcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture, the first (and as of 2015, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect.\n\n\n=== World Heritage Sites ===\nBarcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:\n\n\n=== Historic buildings and monuments ===\n\nMinor basilica of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, the symbol of Barcelona.\nPalau de la M\u00fasica Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau, designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, included in the UNESCO Heritage List in 1997.\nWorks by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, including Park G\u00fcell, Palau G\u00fcell, Casa Mil\u00e0 (La Pedrera), Casa Vicens, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Nativity fa\u00e7ade and crypt), Casa Batll\u00f3, crypt in Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell. The first three works were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1984. The other four were added as extensions to the site in 2005.\nThe Cathedral of the Holy Cross and St. Eulalia (Gothic)\nGothic basilica of Santa Maria del Mar\nGothic basilica of Santa Maria del Pi\nRomanesque church of Sant Pau del Camp\nPalau Reial Major, medieval residence of the sovereign Counts of Barcelona, later Kings of Aragon\nThe Royal Shipyard (gothic)\nMonastery of Pedralbes (gothic)\nThe Columbus Monument\nThe Arc de Triomf, a triumphal arch built for entrance to 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition.\nExpiatory church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the summit of Tibidabo.\nThe Historic Building of the University of Barcelona\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nBarcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Picasso Museum, and Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas.\nSeveral museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueolog\u00eda y Ciencias Naturales\" (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too.\nThe FC Barcelona Museum has been the most visited museum in the city of Barcelona, with 1,506,022 visitors in 2013.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest. They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres). The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year, with a proportion of 18.1 square metres (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.Of Barcelona's parks, Montju\u00efc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name. It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old military citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinard\u00f3 Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park G\u00fcell (designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Drag\u00f3 Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains. There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aig\u00fces (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona. Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nBarcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic and Discovery Channel. Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) of coastline. Sant Sebasti\u00e0, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length, are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.\nThe Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Ic\u00e0ria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material.

          "This is just so fake, I can't grasp why people would build this, let alone ride a boat. It has nothing to do with Venice and lacks any atmosphere and purpose. Baku is better off highlighting aspects that are unique to the city and country than build stuff like this. Awful.",
          "We wandered through this area and the gardens after visiting the fabulous Carpet Museum. It is very clean and feels like a mini version of what one could expect to see in Dubai. Pleasant and the boat trips are inexpensive.",
          "Located in Boulevard area. 30 mins boat ride and man made little venice. 3 Manat for boat ride per person. Area is very clean & neat",
          "This is not a must do but it is a gentle bit of fun to while away a few minutes of an afternoon, while walking through the gardens.",
          "Its very nice place to walk and have a small boat ride by paying very minimal charges, Its fun of short time. If you are in Old City , or Maidan Tower or Sahil Area its the walkable distance to have the fun. Ticket is just 3 Manat.",

          "This is a strange attraction which seems decidedly unexceptional to me. A mix of waterways and concrete bridges doesn\u2019t really make this Venice. On the plus side there were boats to hire and the attraction was clean and well kept.",

          "At the end of the Baku Seaside Boulevard promenade, there's an area with some artificial canals and bridges, which is meant to give a bit of a Venice feel. You can even go for a ride on a \"gondola\", although everything is a bit swimming-pool/plastic feeling, so I wouldn't go so",
          "Not as it should be no riding service been noticed we see only one steam small boat no old style boat like what the original one",

        "wiki": "The Heydar Aliyev Center is a 57,500 m2 (619,000 sq ft) building complex in Baku, Azerbaijan designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and noted for its distinctive architecture and flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nIn 2007, Zaha Hadid was appointed as the design architect of the Center after a competition. The Center houses a conference hall (auditorium), a gallery hall and a museum. The project is intended to play an integral role in the intellectual life of the city. Located close to the city center, the site plays a pivotal role in the redevelopment of Baku.\nThe Heydar Aliyev Center represents a fluid form which emerges by the folding of the landscape's natural topography and by the wrapping of individual functions of the Center. All functions of the Center, together with entrances, are represented by folds in a single continuous surface. This fluid form gives an opportunity to connect the various cultural spaces whilst at the same time, providing each element of the Center with its own identity and privacy. As it folds inside, the skin erodes away to become an element of the interior landscape of the Center.Heydar Aliyev Center had an official soft-opening ceremony on 10 May 2012 held by current president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.An internationally recognized architectural work, the building of the Heydar Aliyev Center has become a signature landmark of modern Baku due to its innovative and cutting-edge design. Extending on eight floor levels, the center accommodates a 1000-seat auditorium, temporary exhibition spaces, a conference center, workshops, and a museum.The building was nominated for awards in 2013 at both the World Architecture Festival and the biennial Inside Festival. In 2014, the Center won the Design Museum's Design of the Year Award 2014 despite concerns about the site's human rights record. This makes Zaha Hadid the first woman to win the top prize in that competition.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe building was featured in Extreme Engineering, a documentary television series that airs on the Discovery Channel and the Science Channel. The episode called \"Azerbaijan's Amazing Transformation\" was aired on April 22, 2011 as part of Season 9. The Building was also featured on the \"postcard\" of Samra Rahimli for the postcard of Azerbaijan at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 and in a Google Doodle in 2017.\n\n\n== Ongoing activities ==\n\nOn June 29, 2012, the Heydar Aliyev Center held the official opening of Crans Montana Forum, attended by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, President of Montenegro Filip Vujanovi\u0107, as well as foreign public figures, MPs, intellectuals, and business circles.On July 3, 2012, the Center held the ceremony of the official seeing-off of the Azerbaijani delegation to take part in the XXX Summer Olympic Games in London. The ceremony was attended by the President Republic of Azerbaijan, President of the National Olympic Committee Ilham Aliyev and his spouse Mehriban Aliyeva. Photo banners reflecting the Olympic movement in Azerbaijan were installed in the lobby of the Heydar Aliyev Center. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev made a speech at the ceremony.\n\nOn 20 July 2012, a fire started on the roof of the building at about 11:30am. It was quickly put out by firemen, and it was initially reported that the fire only damaged the roof of the building, leaving the interior only slightly damaged, mainly because of the water used by firemen to extinguish the fire. The fire was found to have resulted from negligence in the use of welding equipment in the roof; three Turkish contractors were subsequently charged under Azerbaijan's criminal code. The resulting damage was found to have had \"grave consequences and material damage on a large scale\". Subsequent to sixteen months of repairs, it was formally (re)opened on November 5, 2013.On Nov. 2 and 3, 2013, Moscow music theater \u201cHelikon-Opera\u201d under the direction of People's Artist of Russia Dmitry Bertman presented performances at the Heydar Aliyev Center.

        "wiki": "Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan Republic, which was also the capital of Shirvan (during the reigns of Akhsitan I and Khalilullah I), Baku Khanate, Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and Azerbaijan SSR and the administrative center of Russian Baku governorate.\nBaku is derived from the old Persian Bagavan, which translates to \"City of God\". A folk etymology explains the name Baku as derived from the Persian B\u0101dkube (\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06a9\u0648\u0628\u0647 ), meaning \"city where the wind blows\", due to frequent winds blowing in Baku. However, the word B\u0101dkube was invented only in the 16th or 17th century, whereas Baku was founded at least before the 5th century AD.\n\n\n== Names in mediaeval sources ==\nStarting from the 13th century AD the name of Baku begins to appear in mediaeval European Sources. Spelling of the name varies from Vahc\u00fch (Pietro Della Valle), to Bakhow, Baca, Bakuie and Backu.\nOn the coins minted by Shirvanshahs name appears as Bakuya.\n\n\n== Other explanations ==\nVarious different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the etymology of the word Baku. According to L.G.Lopatinski and Ali Huseynzade \"Baku\" is derived from Turkic word for \"hill\". K.P. Patkanov, a specialist in Caucasian history, also explains the name as \"hill\" but in Lak language.\n\n\n== Prehistoric and ancient history ==\nAround 100,000 years ago, the territory of modern Baku and Absheron was savanna with rich flora and fauna. Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age. From the Bronze Age there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in the territory of the Old City. This have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory. Near Nardaran in a place called Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table. Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.In the 1st century, Romans organized two Caucasian campaigns and reached Baku. Near Baku, in Gobustan, Roman inscriptions dating from 84\u201396 AD were discovered. The remnant of this period is the village of Ramana in the Sabunchu district of Baku.In the Life of the Apostle Bartholomew, Baku is identified as Armenian albanus. Some historians assume that during the existence of Caucasian Albania Baku was called Albanopolis. Local church traditions record the belief that Bartholomew's martyrdom occurred at the bottom of the Maiden Tower within the Old City, where according to historical data, a Christian church was built on the site of the pagan temple of Arta.\nA record from the 5th-century historian Priscus of Panium was the first to mention the famous Bakuvian fires (ex petra maritima flamma ardet \u2013 from the maritime stone flame emerges). Owing to these eternal fires Baku became a major center of ancient Zoroastrianism. Sassanid shah Ardashir I gave orders \"to keep an inextinguishable fire of the god Ormazd\" in the city temples.\n\n\n== Medieval and early modern period ==\n\nThere is little or no information regarding Baku in medieval sources until the 10th century. The earliest numismatic evidence found in the city is an Abbasid coin dating from the 8th century AD. At that time Baku was a domain of the Arab Caliphate and later of Shirvanshahs. During this period, they frequently came under assault of the Khazars and (starting from the 10th century) the Rus. Shirvanshah Akhsitan I built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled another Rus assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck Shamakhy, the capital of Shirvan, Shirvanshah's court moved to Baku in 1191. A mint was put into operation.Between the 12th and 14th centuries, a massive fortification was undertaken in the city and around it. The Maiden Tower, castles of Ramana, Nardaran, Shagan and Mardakan, and also famous Sabayel castle on the island of the Baku bay was built during this period. The city walls were also rebuilt and strengthened.\nThe biggest problem of Baku during this time was the transgression of the Caspian Sea. The rising levels of the water from time to time engulfed much of the city and the famous castle of Sabayel went completely into the sea in the 14th century. These led to several legends about submerged cities such as Shahriyunan (\"Greek city\").Hulagu Khan occupied Baku under the domain of the Shirvan state during the third Mongol campaign in Azerbaijan (1231\u20131239) and it became a winter residence for Ilkhanids. In the 14th century, the city prospered under Muhammad Oljeitu who relieved it from some of the heavy taxes. Bakuvian poet Nasir Bakui wrote a panegyric to Oljeitu thus creating the first piece of poetry in Azerbaijani language.\nMarco Polo had written of Baku oil exports to Near Eastern countries. The city also traded with the Golden Horde, the Moscow Princedom, and European countries.\nIn 1501, Safavid shah Ismail I laid siege to Baku. The besieged inhabitants resisted, relying for defense on their fortifications. Due to the resistance, Ismail ordered part of the fortification's wall to be undermined. The fortress's defense was destroyed and many inhabitants were slaughtered. In 1538, the Safavid Shah Tahmasp I put an end to the Shirvanshahs' reign and in 1540, Baku was recaptured by Safavid troops again.\nBetween 1568 and 1574 there is a record of six English missions to Baku. English men named Thomas Bannister and Jeffrey Duckett described Baku in their correspondence. They wrote that the \"...town is a strange thing to behold, for there issueth out of the ground a marvelous quantity of oil, which serveth all the country to burn in their houses. This oil is black and is called nefte. There is also by the town of Baku, another kind of oil which is white and very precious, and it is called petroleum\".\nThe first oil well outside of Baku was drilled in 1594 by a craftsman named A. Mamednur oglu. This man finished the construction of a high-efficiency oil well in the Balakhany settlement. This area was historically outside city territory.In 1636, German diplomat and traveler Adam Olearius described Baku's 30 oil fields, noting that there was a great quantity of brown oil. In 1647, famous Turkish traveler Evliya Chelebi visited Baku. In April 1660, Cossacks under Stepan Razin attacked the Baku coast and plundered the village of Mashtaga. In 1683, Baku was visited by the ambassador of the Kingdom of Sweden, Engelbert Kaempfer. In the following year, Baku was temporarily recaptured by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBaku is noted for being a focal point for traders from all across the world during the Early modern period, commerce was active and the area was prosperous. Notably, traders from the Indian subcontinent established themselves in the region. These Indian traders built the Ateshgah of Baku during 17th\u201318th centuries; the temple was used as a Hindu, Sikh, and Parsi place of worship.\n\n\n=== Fall of Safavids and Baku Khanate ===\n\nThe fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1722 caused widespread chaos. Baku was invaded by the Russian and Ottoman empires.On 26 June 1723, after a long siege, Baku surrendered to the Russians and the Safavids were forced to cede the city alongside many other of their Caucasian territories. In accordance with Peter the Great's decree, the soldiers of two regiments (2,382 people) were left in the Baku garrison under the command of Prince Baryatyanski, the commandant of the city. Peter the Great, while equipping a new military expedition commanded by General Mikhail Matyushkin, charged him with sending more oil from Baku to St. Petersburg, \"which is a basis of an eternal and sacred flame\"\u2014Old Russian: \"\u043a\u043e\u044f \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\". However, due to Peter's death, this order was not carried out.In 1733, Baku was visited by physician Ioann Lerkh, an employee of the Russian embassy and, like many others before him, described the city oil fields. By 1730, the situation had deteriorated for the Russians as Nadir Shah's successes in Shirvan forced the Russians to make an agreement near Ganja on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to Persia.\nAfter the disintegration of the Safavid Empire and after the death of Nader Shah, the semi-independent principality of Baku Khanate was formed in 1747 following the power vacuum which had been created. It was ruled by Mirza Muhammed Khan and soon became a dependency of the much stronger Quba Khanate. The population of Baku was small (approximately 5,000), and the economy was ruined as a result of constant warfare, banditry, and inflation. The khans benefited, however, from the sea trade with the rest of Iran. Feudal infighting in the 1790s resulted in the dominance of an anti-Russian faction in the city resulting in the Russian-leaning brother of the Khan being exiled to Quba.By the end of the 18th century, Tsarist Russia now began a more firm policy with the intent to conquer all of the Caucasus at the expense of Persia and Ottoman Turkey. In the spring of 1796, by Yekaterina II's order, General Valerian Zubov's troops started a large campaign against Qajar Persia following the sack of Tblisi and Persia's aim to restore its suzerainty over Georgia and Dagestan. Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, Pavel I ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, Catherine the Great, her death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku.\n\n\n== Persia's forced ceding to the Russian Empire ==\n\nTsar Alexander I set out to conquer Baku once again during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) during which Pavel Tsitsianov tried to capture Baku in January 1806. But aide-de-camp and cousin of Huseyngulu Khan suddenly shot Tsitsianov to death during the presentation of the city's keys to him. Left without a commander, the Russian Army left Baku and the occupation of Baku Khanate was delayed for a year. Baku was captured on October of the same year and eventually absorbed into the Russian Empire after formal ceding of the city amongst other integral territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus by Persia in the Treaty of Gulistan, in 1813. However, it was not until the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay that Baku came under nominal Russian rule, as the city was retaken by Persia during the war.When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the war of 1804\u20131813, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic Tat.\n\n\n=== Early period ===\nIn 1809, at the time of the Russian conquest, the Muslim population grew to become 95% of the city's population.On 10 July 1840, the Russian Duma approved \"The Principles of Ruling of the Transcaucasian Region\", and Baku uyezd was turned into an administrative region of the Russian Empire.\nFortstadt, a new suburb, grew from the dispersed buildings scattered within the city's fortifications. Medieval seaside fortifications were demolished in 1861 to allow for the creation of the port and a customs house in the quay.Baku became a center of the eponymous province after the devastating earthquake of 1859 in Shamakha. The population of Baku Governorate began to increase steadily. It is recorded that the number of police stations increased. The first Baku stock exchange had ten brokers, all of Russian nationality.\n\n\n=== Oil boom ===\nIn 1823, the world's first paraffin factory was built in the city, and in 1846, the world's first oil well was drilled in Bibi-Heybat. Javad Melikov from Baku had built the first kerosene factory in 1863. In 1873, the Russian government offered competition for free land, and Baku caught the eye of the Nobel brothers. In 1882, Ludvig Nobel invited technical staff to Baku from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Germany and founded a colony that he called Villa Petrolea. This colony was located in the \"Black City\". Bullock-cart drivers used wineskins and flasks to transport oil until the 1870s. In 1883, a Rothschild's plenipotentiary arrived from Paris and created the \"Caspian-Black Sea Joint-Stock Company\". Famous Baku oil magnates of the era included Musa Nagiyev, Murtuza Mukhtarov, Shamsi Asadullayev, Seid Mirbabayev, and many others.The companies owned by Musa Nagiyev and Shamsi Asadullayev were the largest of Baku's oil producers. Established respectively in 1887 and 1893, they produced between 7 million and 12 million poods (110 to 200 Gg) of oil annually. The companies owned oil fields, refineries, and tankers. By the beginning of the next century, more than a hundred oil firms operated in Baku.\n\nThe oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries contributed to massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku's population grew at a faster rate than that of London, Paris or New York.\n\n\n=== Pre-revolutionary period ===\n\nThe second half of the 19th century was notable for its advancement in communication. In 1868, the first telegraph line to Tiflis was established, and in 1879, an under-sea telegraph line connected Baku with Krasnovodsk. In the same year, the Baku-Sabunchi-Surakhany was in operation. The tracks were 520 versts (555 kilometres) from Tiflis and was completed in a relatively short time on 8 May 1883. The first telephone line was in operation in 1886. In 1899, the first horse tramway appeared.In 1870, a Lutheran-Evangelical community was established in Baku. However, in 1937, the clerics as well as the representatives of other religious communities were banished or shot. The Lutheran community was not revived until 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union.In the 1870s, the number of administrative and public institutions had grown, among them a provincial court and arbitration. In the first years of the 20th century, a case considered in the district court won great popularity and lawyers from Petersburg, Moscow, Tiflis, and Kiev became involved because of fabulous fees often received there. The loudest litigations passed with the participation of a certain Karabek, who knew by heart the extensive code of laws of the Russian Empire and remembered all decrees of the Sacred Synod with exact reference numbers and dates.\n\nIn the beginning of October 1883, tsar Alexander III with his wife and two sons, accompanied by a huge retinue, arrived to Baku from Tiflis. The railway station had been prepared for the solemn ceremony. The city authorized Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev to welcome Alexander. The visitors examined the oil storage of Nobel brothers, the pump station, and three powerful oil wells of Shamsi Asadullayev. Beginning from the 1890s, Baku provided 95% of the oil production in the Russian Empire and approximately half of world oil production. Within ten years, the city had become the foremost producer of oil overtaking the United States.In 1894, the city's first water distiller was put into operation.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn 1914\u20131917, Baku produced 7 million tons of oil each year, totaling 28,683,000 tons of oil , which constituted 15% of world production at the time. Germany did not trust Turkey in oil matters and transferred General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein from the Middle Eastern front with his troops to Georgia in order to enter Baku, through Ukraine, the Black Sea and Georgia. Great Britain, in February 1918, urgently sent General Lionel Dunsterville with troops to Baku through Anzali to block the German troops. Having studied the Caucasus from the strategic point of view, Dunsterville concluded: \"Those who capture Baku, will control the sea. That's why it was necessary for us to invade this city\". On 23 August 1918, Lenin in his telegram to Tashkent wrote: \"Germans agree to attack Baku provided that we would kick the British out of Baku\".Having been defeated in World War I, Turkey had to withdraw its forces from the borders of Azerbaijan in the middle of November 1918. Led by General William Thomson, British troops of 5,000 soldiers arrived in Baku on 17 November, and martial law was implemented on the capital of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic until \"the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order\".In the same year, Thompson was faced with an enormous challenge to recreate confidence in the economy. His fundamental requirement was to recreate a sound and reliable banking system. He wrote, however: \"the political situation in Baku does not permit the opening of a British Bank because this would have increased suspicion and jealousy as to British intentions.\"\n\n\n=== Photo gallery of Old Baku ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Soviet Baku ==\n\nIn the spring of 1918, Armenian interests in Baku were protected by the Baku Soviet of People's Commissars, who became known as the 26 Baku Commissars.\nIn February 1920, the 1st Congress of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan legally took place in Baku and made a decision about preparation of the armed revolt. On 27 April of the same year, units of the Russian 11th Red Army crossed the border of Azerbaijan and began to march towards Baku. Soviet Russia presented the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic with an ultimatum to surrender, and the troops entered Baku the next day, accompanied by Grigory Ordzhonikidze and Sergey Kirov of the Bolshevik Kavbiuro. The city became a capital of the Azerbaijan SSR and underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of the Soviet life. Since about 1921, the city was headed by the Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as Bakgorispolkom. Together with the Baku Party Committee (known as the Baksovet), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major Trade fairs of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.On 8 February 1924, the first tram line and two years later the electric railway Baku-Surakhany\u2014the first in the USSR\u2014started to operate.\nWhile being in Baku in May 1925 Russian poet Sergei Yesenin wrote a verse \"Farewell to Baku\":\n\nFarewell to Baku! I'll see you no more\nA sorrow and fright are now in the soul\nAnd a heart under the hand is more painful and closer\n\nAnd I feel the simple word \"friend\" more distinctly.\nHowever Yesenin returned to the city on 28 July of the same year.\nMaxim Gorkiy wrote after visiting Baku: \"The oil fields remained in my memory as a perfect picture of the grave hell. This picture suppressed all the fantastic ideas of depressed mind, I was aware of\". Well-known\u2014at that time\u2014industrialist V. Rogozin noted, in relation with the Baku oil fields, that everything there was done \"without counting and calculating\". In 1940, 22.2 million tons of oil were extracted in Baku which comprised nearly 72% of all the oil extracted in the entire USSR.In 1941, the trolley bus line started to operate in the city, meanwhile the first buses appeared in Baku in 1928.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe US Ambassador to France, W. Bullitt, dispatched a telegram to Washington concerning \"the possibilities of bombing and demolition of Baku\" which were being discussed in Paris at the time. Charles de Gaulle was extremely critical of the plan according to both his wartime and postwar statements. Such ideas, he believed, were made by some \"crazy heads that were thinking more of how to destroy Baku than of resisting Berlin\". In his report submitted on 22 February 1940, to French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Daladier, General Maurice Gamelin believed the Soviets would fall into crisis if those resources were lost. However, during the Soviet-German War, ten defense zones were built around the city to prevent possible German invasion, planned within the Operation Edelweiss.\nEven a cake for Hitler was adorned by a map of the Caspian Sea with the letters B-A-K-U spelled out in chocolate cream. After eating the cake, Hitler said: \"Unless we get Baku oil, the war is lost\".\n\n\n=== Post-war period ===\nThe first offshore oil platform in the world, originally called \"The Black Rocks,\" was built in 1947 within the city's metropolitan area. In 1960, the first Caucasus house-building plant was built in Baku, and on 25 December 1975, the only plant producing air-conditioners in the Soviet Union was turned over for operation.In 1964\u20131968, the level of oil extraction rose to the stable level and comprised about 21 million tons per year. By the 1970s, Azerbaijan became one of the largest producers of grapes, and a champagne factory was subsequently constructed in Baku. In 1981, a record quantity of 15 billion m\u00b3 of gas was extracted in Baku.\n\n\n== Independence era ==\n\nIn 1990, Shaumyan rayon of Baku was renamed to Khatai and Ordzhonikidze rayon to Narimanov. In 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Bakgorispolkom as a result, the first independent city mayor Rafael Allahverdiyev was appointed. On 29 April 1992, the names of some more city rayons were changed:\n\n26 Baku Commissars to Sabail\nKirov to Binagadi\nLenin to Sabunchi\nOctober to Yasamal.With the initiatives for saving the city in the 2000s, Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history. Thousands of buildings from Soviet Period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land claimed by filling up the beaches of the Baku Bay. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, garbage collection fields and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the Caspian Sea.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n According to a stone inscription, the city's first fortified walls were erected by Shirvanshah Manuchehr II. The fortifications that once surrounded Baku were repeatedly destroyed due to invasions. These fortifications were composed of multiple lines of walls interspersed with moats that connected to channels leading to the Caspian Sea. These fortifications featured drawbridges which were raised at twilight. In 1078 the Broken Tower (S\u0131n\u0131q-Qala), the city's first mosque, was built. The construction of the city's historical core, named the Inner City, began in the 14th century.For many centuries, Baku engaged in trade with its neighbors. Trade was made possible by caravan routes and sea ways. Bukhara and Indian caravan-sheds within the Inner City testified that in the 14th to 16th centuries, Baku conducted trade with India and Central Asia.One of the first prominent Baku architects, Kasum-bek Gadjibababekov, is credited for the city's layout which was admired by Russian and European planners. Due to the city's topography, streets in Baku at this time were laid in steps. The unpaved streets were sometimes shrouded in clouds of dust for weeks at a time when the northern wind, known as Khazri, or the southern wind, Gilavar, blew.The Russian traveller I. Beryozin, who visited Baku in the middle of the 19th century described the city streets as \"...narrow and entangled, that after a month in Baku I did not know, where a street began and where it ended.\"In 1859, the construction of Baku's city port began, and, in 1861, A. Ulski, Captain-lieutenant of the Russian Fleet, took the city's first photograph. Drainage was installed in 1878. British civil engineer William Heerlein Lindley, who worked in the city from 1899 until his death in 1917, coordinated the building of Baku's water supply system.On 3 May (21 April O.S.), 1896, the notable Nobel family laid the foundation stone for the city's Lutheran church. It was one of the few places of worship that was not demolished during Stalin's rule. Since then its primary use has been for concerts\u2014the church houses one of the few pipe organs in Baku. A Molokan meeting-house functions on the so-called Molokanka, near the former Chapayev Street.In 1898, German civil engineer Nicholas von der Nonne developed the first professional plan for the growth of Baku. In the early 1960s, during the term of Baku mayor Alish Lemberanski, the city's micro-regions (suburbs) were created outside of Baku, and old, crumbling buildings gave way to Soviet-style architecture. Narrow streets were widened into boulevards to accommodate more vehicles. In April 1960, as part of the festivities during the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Union, a walking tour was arranged to show the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev a brand-new walkway made of colorful blue and pink concrete slabs. In fact, Khrushchev never saw the walkway, but typical buildings of this period are still called khruschovki, from Russian: \u0445\u0440\u0443\u0449\u00eb\u0432\u043a\u0438.\nRecently, the current mayor of Baku, Hajibala Abutalybov, has been criticized for the city's decline in appearance.Baku has also announced its intentions to bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nBaku was the host city for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nNearly every street that brings to mind anything relating to the Soviet Union has been officially changed. More than 225 names of streets have been renamed since 1988; however, some people still use the old names. Namely, the first street ever to be built outside the Inner City, originally called Nikolayevskaya after Nicolas I, was renamed to Parlaman Kuchesi, because the Parliament of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic held its meeting in a building located at that street, then during soviet era it became Kommunisticheskaya Ulitsa and now is called \u0130stiqlaliyyet Kuchesi (Azeri: \"independence\").\n\n\n=== Notable streets ===\n\n\n=== Old squares names ===\n\n\n=== Old parks names ===\n\n\n== City mayors ==\nThe mayorship has been interrupted mainly by the rules of General-Governor, City Council, People's Commissars Council and Bakgorispolkom.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of Baku\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nPublished in the 19th centuryJedidiah Morse; Richard C.

        "wiki": "Baku (; Azerbaijani: Bak\u0131, IPA: [b\u0251\u02c8c\u026f]) is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region. Baku is located 28 metres (92 ft) below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Baku lies on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, alongside the Bay of Baku. At the beginning of 2009, Baku's urban population was estimated at just over two million people. Officially, about 25% of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku's metropolitan area. Baku is the sole metropolis in Azerbaijan.\nBaku is divided into twelve administrative raions and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on the islands of the Baku Archipelago, and the town of Oil Rocks built on stilts in the Caspian Sea, 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Baku. The Inner City of Baku, along with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower, were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. According to the Lonely Planet's ranking, Baku is also among the world's top ten destinations for urban nightlife.The city is the scientific, cultural, and industrial centre of Azerbaijan. Many sizeable Azerbaijani institutions have their headquarters there. The Baku International Sea Trade Port is capable of handling two million tonnes of general and dry bulk cargoes per year. In recent years, Baku has become an important venue for international events. It hosted the 57th Eurovision Song Contest in 2012, the 2015 European Games, 4th Islamic Solidarity Games, the F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix since 2016, hosted the final of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League, and will be one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020.\nThe city is renowned for its harsh winds, which is reflected in its nickname, the \"City of Winds\".\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBaku is long attested under the Perso-Arabic name \u0628\u0627\u06a9\u0648 (B\u0101k\u016b). Early Arabic sources also refer to the city as B\u0101kuh and B\u0101kuya, all of which seem to come from a Persian name. The further etymology is unclear.\nA popular etymology in the 19th century considered it to be derived from Persian \u0628\u0627\u062f\u06a9\u0648\u0628\u0647 (B\u00e2d-kube, meaning \"wind-pounded city\", a compound of b\u0101d, \"wind\", and kube, which is rooted in the verb \u06a9\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0646 kubidan, \"to pound\", thus referring to a place where wind would be strong and pounding, as is the case of Baku, which is known to experience fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds). This popular name (Badkub\u0259 in modern Azerbaijani script) actually gained currency as a nickname for the city by the 19th century (e.g., it is used in Akinchi, volume 1, issue 1, p. 1), and is also reflected in the city's modern nickname as the \"City of Winds\" (Azerbaijani: K\u00fcl\u0259kl\u0259r \u015f\u0259h\u0259ri). Another and even less probable folk etymology explains the name as deriving from Baghkuy, meaning \"God's town\". Baga (now \u0628\u063a bagh) and kuy are the Old Persian words for \"god\" and \"town\" respectively; the name Baghkuy may be compared with Baghd\u0101d (\"God-given\") in which d\u0101d is the Old Persian word for \"give\".\nDuring Soviet rule, the city was spelled in Cyrillic as \"\u0411\u0430\u043a\u044b\" in Azerbaijani (while the Russian spelling was and still is \"\u0411\u0430\u043a\u0443\", Bak\u00fa). The modern Azerbaijani spelling, which has been using the Latin alphabet since 1991, is Bak\u0131; the shift from the Perso-Arabic letter \u0648 (\u016b) to Cyrillic \"\u044b\" and, later, Latin \"\u0131\" may be compared to that in other Azerbaijani words (e.g. compare \u0642\u0627\u067e\u0648 q\u0101p\u016b in old Perso-Arabic spelling with modern Azerbaijani qap\u0131, \"door\") or in suffixes, as \u0648 was often used to transcribe the vowel harmony in Azerbaijani (which was also the practice in Ottoman Turkish). (See also Azerbaijani alphabet.)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAround 100,000 years ago, the territory of modern Baku and Absheron was savanna with rich flora and fauna. Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age. From the Bronze Age there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory. Near Nardaran, in a place called Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table. Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.\nIn the 1st century CE, the Romans organised two Caucasian campaigns and reached Baku. Near the city, in Gobustan, Roman inscriptions dating from 84\u201396 CE were discovered. This is one of the earliest written evidences for Baku.\n\n\n=== Rise of the Shirvanshahs and the Safavid era ===\n\nBaku was the realm of the Shirvanshahs during the 8th century CE. The city frequently came under assault of the Khazars and (starting from the 10th century) the Rus. Shirvanshah Akhsitan I built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled another Rus assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck Shamakhi, the capital of Shirvan, Shirvanshah's court moved to Baku in 1191.\n\nThe Shirvan era greatly influenced Baku and the remainder of what is present-day Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were undertaken in Baku and the surrounding towns. The Maiden Tower, the Ramana Tower, the Nardaran Fortress, the Shagan Castle, the Mardakan Castle, the Round Castle and also the famous Sabayil Castle on the island of the Bay of Baku was built during this period. The city walls of Baku were also rebuilt and strengthened.\nBy the early 16th century Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the focus of its larger neighbours; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the in Iran-centred Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian Safavid dynasty, led by king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku a part of the Shirvan province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties to come for the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the first half of the 19th century. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.\nAt this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578\u20131590; by 1607, it was again put under Iranian control. In 1604 Baku fortress was destroyed by Shah Abbas I (r. 1588-1629).\n\nBaku is noted for being a focal point for traders from all across the world during the Early modern period, commerce was active and the area was prosperous. Notably, traders from the Indian subcontinent established themselves in the region. These Indian traders built the Ateshgah of Baku during 17th\u201318th centuries; the temple was used as a Hindu, Sikh, and Parsi place of worship.\n\n\n=== Downfall of the Safavids and the Khanate of Baku ===\nIn the wake of the demise of the Safavids, the Russians took advantage of the situation and invaded; the Safavids were forced to cede Baku to Russia for a few years. By 1730, the situation had deteriorated for the Russians; the successes of Nader Shah (r. 1736\u20131747) forced them to make an agreement near Ganja on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to Iran.The eruption of instability following Nader Shah's death gave rise to the various Caucasian khanates. The semi-autonomous Persian-ruled Baku Khanate was one of these. It was ruled by Mirza Muhammed Khan but soon became a dependency of the much stronger Quba Khanate. During this time, the population of Baku was small (approximately 5,000), and the economy was ruined as a result of constant warfare.\n\n\n=== Russo-Persian Wars and Iran's forced ceding ===\n\nFrom the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geopolitical stance towards its two neighbours and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. In the spring of 1796, by Catherine II\u2019s order, General Valerian Zubov\u2019s troops started a large campaign against Qajar Persia. Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, Pavel I ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, Catherine the Great's death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of Qajar Iran again.\nIn 1813, following the Russo-Persian War of 1804\u20131813, Qajar Iran was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan with Russia, which provided for the irrevocable cession of Baku and most of Iran's territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the Russo-Persian War of 1826\u20131828, Baku was briefly recaptured by the Iranians. However, militarily superior, the Russians ended this war in a victory as well, and the resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay made its inclusion into the Russian Empire definite.\nWhen Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the war of 1804\u201313, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic Tat.\n\n\n=== Discovery of oil ===\n\nThe Russians built the first oil-distilling factory in Balaxani in 1837.  Drilling for oil began in the mid-1800s, with the first oil well drilled in the Bibi-Heybat suburb of Baku in 1846. It was mechanically drilled, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872 when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. The pioneer of oil extracting from the bottom of the sea was Polish geologist Witold Zglenicki. Soon after investors appeared in Baku, including the Nobel Brothers in 1873 and the Rothschilds in 1882. An industrial area of oil refineries, better known as Black Town, was established near Baku by the early 1880s.Professor A. V. Williams Jackson of Columbia University wrote in his work From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam (1911):\n\nBaku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found. Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here: 'the rock poured me out rivers of oil.\nOil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen \u2013 everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, half of the oil sold in international markets was being extracted in Baku. The oil boom contributed to the massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku's population grew at a faster rate than that of London, Paris or New York.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nIn 1917, after the October Revolution and amidst the turmoil of World War I and the breakup of the Russian Empire, Baku came under the control of the Baku Commune, which was led by veteran Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan. Seeking to capitalize on the existing ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the famous March Days, Bolsheviks and Dashnaks seeking to establish control over Baku streets, were faced with armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered defeat by the united forces of Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams in what was called March Days. An estimated 3,000\u201312,000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital. After the massacre, on 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijani faction of the Transcaucasian Sejm proclaimed the independence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) in Ganja, thereby becoming the first Muslim-majority democratic and secular republic. The newly independent Azerbaijani republic, being unable to defend the independence of the country on their own, asked the Ottoman Empire for military support in accordance with clause 4 of the treaty between the two countries. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the Ottoman Army of Islam led by Nuru Pasha, started their advance onto Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of Bolsheviks, Esers, Dashnaks, Mensheviks and British forces under the command of General Lionel Dunsterville on 15 September 1918.\nAfter the Battle of Baku, the Azerbaijani irregular troops, with the tacit support of the Turkish command, conducted four days of pillaging and killing of 10,000 to 30,000 of the Armenian residents of Baku. This pogrom was known as the September Days. Shortly after this, Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.\nTurkey lost the war by October 1918, then conducted the Armistice of Mudros with the British, which meant Baku was to be evacuated. Headed by General William Thomson, British troops of 5,000 soldiers, including parts of Dunsterforce, arrived in Baku on 17 November. Thomson declared himself military governor of Baku and implemented martial law on the capital until \"the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order\". British forces left before the end of 1919.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nThe independence of the Azerbaijani republic was significant but a short-lived chapter. On 28 April 1920, the 11th Red Army invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.\nThe city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of Soviet life. Baku was the major oil city of the Soviet Union. Since about 1921, the city was headed by Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as Bakgorispolkom. Together with Baku Party Committee (known as the Baksovet), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major Trade fairs of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nBaku's growing importance as a major energy hub remained in sight of the major powers. During World War II and the Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union, Baku had become of vital strategic importance. In fact, capturing the oil fields of Baku was one of the ultimate goals of Operation Edelweiss, carried out between May and November 1942. However, the German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some 530 kilometres (329 miles) northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet Operation Little Saturn in mid-December 1942.\n\n\n=== Fall of the Soviet Union and later ===\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history. Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the Baku Bay. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east\u2013west axis along the shores of the Caspian Sea. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBaku is situated on the western coast of Caspian Sea. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of mud volcanoes (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, Lokbatan and others) and salt lakes (Boyukshor, Khodasan and so on).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBaku has a temperate semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSk) with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers and substantial sunshine hours. This is largely because of its northerly latitude and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Baku, and the Absheron Peninsula on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan (precipitation here is around or less than 200 mm (8 in) a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons is particularly wet.\nDuring Soviet times, Baku, with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated spa complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial centre left it one of the most polluted cities in the world, as of 2008.At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the \"City of Winds\", and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind khazri and the warm southern wind gilavar are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.\nThe speed of the khazri sometimes reaches 144 km/h (89 mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.The daily mean temperature in July and August averages 26.4 \u00b0C (79.5 \u00b0F), and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the khazri sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging 4.3 \u00b0C (39.7 \u00b0F). During winter the khazri sweeps through, driven by polar air masses; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter snow storms are occasional; snow usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nToday, Baku is divided into 12 rayonlar (sub-rayons) (administrative districts) and 5 settlements of city type.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nUntil 1988, Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to cultural diversity and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the Karabakh War and the pogrom against Armenians starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.\nUnder Communism, the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalised by the Soviets, to the Jewish community. He encouraged the restoration of these buildings and is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nToday the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic Azerbaijanis (more than 90%). When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the war of 1804\u201313, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic Tat. The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population. In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 internally displaced persons and 93,400 refugees.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are Shia Muslims, and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after Iran. The city's notable mosques include Juma Mosque, Bibi-Heybat Mosque, Muhammad Mosque and Taza Pir Mosque.\nThere are some other faiths practised among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its Constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include Russian Orthodox Christians, Catholic Levantines, Georgian Orthodox Christians, Lutherans, Ashkenazi Jews and Sufi Muslims. Baku is the seat of the Catholic Apostolic Prefecture of Azerbaijan.\nZoroastrianism, although extinct in the city as well as in the rest of the country by the present time, had a long history in Azerbaijan and the Zoroastrian New Year (Nowruz) continues to be the main holiday in the city as well as in the rest of Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBaku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's balance of payments. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku. By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.\nCommercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the Baku oil fields were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century skilled workers and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of oil industry equipment before World War II. The World War II Battle of Stalingrad was fought to determine who would have control of Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.The oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field (Shallow water Gunashli by SOCAR, deeper areas by a consortium led by BP), development of the Shah Deniz gas field, the expansion of the Sangachal Terminal and the construction of the BTC Pipeline.\nThe Baku Stock Exchange is Azerbaijan's largest stock exchange, and largest in the Caucasian region by market capitalization. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the International Bank of Azerbaijan, which employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include HSBC, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Credit Suisse.\n\n\n=== Tourism and shopping ===\nBaku is one of the most important tourist destinations in the Caucasus, with hotels in the city earning 7 million euros in 2009. Many sizable world hotel chains have a presence in the city. Baku has many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown Fountains Square, the One and Thousand Nights Beach, Shikhov Beach and Oil Rocks. Baku's vicinities feature Yanar Dag, an ever-blazing spot of natural gas. On 2 September 2010 with the inauguration of National Flag Square, Baku set the world record  for tallest flagpole; on 24 May 2011, the city of Dushanbe in Tajikistan set a new record with a 3 metres (9.8 feet)-higher flagpole. A few years later, the Flag Pole was dismantled and the National Flag Square was closed off with fences.\nBaku has several shopping malls; the most famous city centre malls are Port Baku, Park Bulvar, Ganjlik Mall, Metro Park, 28 MALL, Aygun city and AF MALL. The retail areas contain shops from chain stores up to high-end boutiques.\nThe city is listed 48th in the 2011 list of the most expensive cities in the world conducted by the Mercer Human Resource Consulting. Its Nizami Street and also the Neftchilar Avenue are among the most expensive streets in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe city has many amenities that offer a wide range of cultural activities, drawing both from a rich local dramatic portfolio and an international repertoire. In 2007 the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid, was opened. Baku also boasts many museums such as Baku Museum of Modern Art and Azerbaijan State Museum of History, most notably featuring historical artifacts and art. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 2009 when Baku was designated an Islamic Culture Capital. Baku was chosen to host the Eurovision Dance Contest 2010. It has also become the first city hosting the first European Games in 2015.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nAzerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre\nAzerbaijan State Academic Drama Theatre\nAzerbaijan State Russian Drama Theatre named after Samad Vurgun\nBaku Puppet Theatre (formally Azerbaijan State Puppet Theatre named after Abdulla Shaig)\nAzerbaijan State Theatre of Young Spectators\nAzerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy\nBaku State Circus\n\"Oda\" Theatre\nBaku Marionette Theatre\nBaku Municipal Theatre\nAzerbaijan State Pantomime Theatre\nMugham Azerbaijan National Music Theatre\nAzerbaijan State Theatre of Song named after Rashid Behbudov\n\"UNS\" Theatre\n\"Yugh\" TheatreAmong Baku's prestigious cultural venues are Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall, Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre. The main movie theatre is Azerbaijan Cinema.\nFestivals include Baku International Film Festival, Baku International Jazz Festival, Novruz Festival, G\u00fcl Bayram\u0131 (Flower Festival) and the National Theater Festival. International and local exhibitions are presented at the Baku Expo Centre.\nAs of 2012, the city along with Ganja and Lankaran participates in Earth Hour movement.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe Museum Centre\nMuseum of Archaeology and Ethnography\nAzerbaijan State Carpet Museum\nAzerbaijan Museum of Geology\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nANAS Central Library of Science\nPresidential Library (former Library of the Armenian Philanthropic Society)\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nBaku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the Old City core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in eclectic style. Baku has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'. Baku joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n=== Hamams ===\nThe Hamam tradition in Baku is interesting. There are a number of ancient hamams in Baku dating back to the 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams play a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.\n\n\n==== Teze Bey Hamam ====\nTeze Bey is the most popular hamam (traditional bath) in Baku. It was built in 1886 in the centre of Baku and in 2003 it was fully restored and modernised. Along with its modern amenities, Teze Bey features a swimming pool and architectural details inspired by Oriental, Russian and Finnish baths.\n\n\n==== Gum Hamam ====\nGum Hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations underneath the sand; hence the name: Gum hamam (sand bath). It was built sometime during the 12th\u201314th centuries.\n\n\n==== Bairamali hamam ====\nIn ancient times Bairamali Hamam was called \u201cBey Hamam\u201d. The original structure was built sometime during the 12th\u201314th centuries and was reconstructed in 1881.\n\n\n==== Agha Mikayil Hamam ====\nAgha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the 18th century by Haji Agha Mikayil on Kichik Gala Street in the Old City (Icherisheher). It is still operating in its ancient setting. The Hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays and to men on the other days of the week.\n\n\n=== Modern architecture ===\nLate modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the International Mugham Center, Azerbaijan Tower, Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre, Flame Towers, Baku Crystal Hall, Baku White City, SOCAR Tower and DENIZ Mall. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programmes such as Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, two caravansaries, the baths and the Juma Mosque (which used to house the Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.\nIn 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the List of World Heritage in Danger, citing damage from a November 2000 earthquake, poor conservation as well as \"dubious\" restoration efforts. In 2009 the Inner City was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger.\n\n\n=== Music and media ===\n\nThe music scene in Baku can be traced back to ancient times and villages of Baku, generally revered as the fountainhead of meykhana and mugham in the Azerbaijan.In recent years, the success of Azerbaijani performers such as AySel, Farid Mammadov, Sabina Babayeva, Safura and Elnur H\u00fcseynov in the Eurovision Song Contest has significantly boosted the profile of Baku's music scene, prompting international attention. Following the victory of Azerbaijan's representative Eldar & Nigar at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, Baku hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2012.2005 was a landmark in the development of Azerbaijani jazz in the city. It has been home to legendary jazz musicians like Vagif Mustafazadeh, Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, Rafig Babayev and Rain Sultanov. Among Baku's prominent annual fairs and festivals is Baku International Jazz Festival, which features some of the world's most identifiable jazz names.Baku also has a thriving International Centre of Mugham, which is located in Baku Boulevard, Gulustan Palace and Buta Palace, one of the principal performing arts centres and music venues in the city.The majority of Azerbaijan's media companies (including television, newspaper and radio, such as, Azad Azerbaijan TV, Ictimai TV, Lider TV and Region TV) are headquartered in Baku. The films The World Is Not Enough and The Diamond Arm are set in the city, while Amphibian Man includes several scenes filmed in Old City.\nOut of the city's radio stations, Ictimai Radio, Radio Antenn, Burc FM, Avto FM, ASAN Radio and Lider FM Jazz are some of the more influential competitors with large national audiences.\nSome of the most influential Baku newspapers include the daily Azadliq, Zaman (The Time), Bakinskiy Rabochiy (Baku Worker), Echo and the English-language Baku Today.\nBaku is also featured in the video game Battlefield 4.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBaku boasts a vibrant nightlife. Many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. Clubs with an eastern flavour provide special treats from the cuisine of Azerbaijan along with local music. Western-style clubs target younger, more energetic crowds. Most of the public houses and bars are located near Fountains Square and are usually open until the early hours of the morning.\nBaku is home to restaurants catering to every cuisine and occasion. Restaurants range from luxurious and expensive to ordinary and affordable.In the Lonely Planet \"1000 Ultimate Experiences\", Baku placed 8th among the top 10 party cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nBaku has large sections of greenery either preserved by the National Government or designated as green zones. The city, however, continues to lack a green belt development as economic activity pours into the capital, resulting in massive housing projects along the suburbs.Baku Boulevard is a pedestrian promenade that runs parallel to Baku's seafront. The boulevard contains an amusement park, yacht club, musical fountain, statues and monuments. The park is popular with dog-walkers and joggers, and is convenient for tourists. It is adjacent to the newly built International Centre of Mugham and the musical fountain.\nOther prominent parks and gardens include Heydar Aliyev Park, Samad Vurgun Park, Narimanov Park, Alley of Honor and the Fountains Square. The Martyrs' Lane, formerly the Kirov Park, is dedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives during the Nagorno-Karabakh War and also to the 137 people killed on Black January.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n Baku hosts a Formula One race on the Baku City Circuit.  The first was the 2016 European Grand Prix, with the track going around the old city. The track measures 6.003 km (3.735 mi), and it has been on the Formula One calendar since its 2016 debut.\nThe city will also host three group games and one quarter-final of the UEFA Euro 2020 European Football Championship.Since 2002, Baku has hosted 36 major sporting events and selected to host the 2015 European Games. Baku is also to host the fourth edition of the Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017.\nBaku is also one of world's leading chess centres, having produced famous grandmasters like Teimour Radjabov, Vugar Gashimov, Garry Kasparov, Shahriyar Mammadyarov and Rauf Mammadov, as well as the arbiter Faik Hasanov. The city also annually hosts the international tournaments such as Baku Chess Grand Prix, President's Cup, Baku Open and bidding to host 42nd Chess Olympiad in 2014.First class sporting facilities were built for the indoor games, including the Palace of Hand Games and Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex.

Since 2011 the city annually hosts WTA tennis event called Baku Cup.The Synergy Baku Cycling Project participates in the Tour d'Azerba\u00efdjan a 2.2 multi-stage bicycle race on the UCI Europe Tour.\nBaku made a bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Olympics, but failed to become a Candidate City both times.The largest sport hub in the city is Baku Olympic Stadium with 68,700 seating capacity whose construction was completed in 2015. UEFA Europa League Final 2019 was played at the Olympic Stadium in Baku on 29 May 2019 between English sides Chelsea and Arsenal. The city's three main football clubs are Neftchi Baku, Inter Baku and Qaraba\u011f FK of whom first has eight Premier League titles making Neftchi the most successful Azerbaijani football club. Baku also has several football clubs in the premier and regional leagues, including AZAL and Ravan in Premier League. The city's second largest stadium, Tofiq Bahramov Stadium hosts a number of domestic and international competitions and was the main sport centre of the city for a long period until the construction of Baku Olympic Stadium.\nIn the Azerbaijan Women's Volleyball Super League, Baku is represented by Rabita Baku, Azerrail Baku, Lokomotiv Baku and Azeryol Baku.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThroughout history the transport system of Baku used the now-defunct horsecars, trams and narrow gauge railways. As of 2011, 1,000 black cabs are ordered by Baku Taxi Company, and as part of a programme originally announced by the Transport Ministry of Azerbaijan, there is a plan to introduce London cabs into Baku. The move was part of \u00a316 million agreement between Manganese Bronze subsidiary LTI Limited and Baku Taxi Company.Local rail transport includes the Baku Funicular and the Baku Metro, a rapid-transit system notable for its art, murals, mosaics and ornate chandeliers. Baku Metro was opened in November 1967 and includes 3 lines and 25 stations at present; 170 million people used Baku Metro over the past five years. In 2008, the Chief of Baku Metro, Taghi Ahmadov, announced plans to construct 41 new stations over the next 17 years. These will serve the new bus complex as well as the international airport. In 2019, the Baku suburban railway opened.\nBakuCard is a single Smart Card for payment on all types of city transport. The intercity buses and metro use this type of card-based fare-payment system.Baku Railway Station is the terminus for national and international rail links to the city. The Kars\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Baku railway, which directly connects Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan, began to be constructed in 2007 and opened in 2017. The completed branch will connect Baku with Tbilisi in Georgia, and from there trains will continue to Akhalkalaki, and Kars in Turkey.\n\nSea transport is vital for Baku, as the city is practically surrounded by the Caspian Sea to the east. Shipping services operate regularly from Baku across the Caspian Sea to Turkmenbashi (formerly Krasnovodsk) in Turkmenistan and to Bandar Anzali and Bandar Nowshar in Iran. The commuter ferries, along with the high-speed catamaran Seabus (Deniz Avtobusu), also form the main connection between the city and the Absheron peninsula.Baku Port was founded in 1902 and since then has been the largest Caspian Sea port. It has six facilities: the main cargo terminal, the container terminal, the ferry terminal, the oil terminal, the passenger terminal and the port fleet terminal. The port's throughput capacity reaches 15 million tonness of liquid bulk and up to 10 million tons of dry cargoes.\nBeginning in 2010, the Baku International Sea Trade Port is being reconstructed. The construction will take place in three stages and will be completed by 2016. The estimated costs are 400 Million US$. From April to November Baku Port is accessible to ships loading cargoes for direct voyages from Western European and Mediterranean ports. The State Road M-1 and the European route E60 are the two main motorway connections between Europe and Azerbaijan. The motorway network around Baku is well developed and is constantly being extended.\nThe Heydar Aliyev International Airport is the only commercial airport serving Baku. The new Baku Cargo Terminal was officially opened in March 2005. It was constructed to be a major cargo hub in the CIS countries and is actually now one of the biggest and most technically advanced in the region. There are also several smaller military airbases near Baku, such as Baku Kala Air Base, intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBaku hosts many universities, junior colleges and vocational schools. Baku State University, the first established university in Azerbaijan was opened in 1919 by the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. In the early years of the Soviet era, Baku already had Azerbaijan State Oil Academy, Azerbaijan Medical University and Azerbaijan State Economic University. In the post-WWII period, a few more universities were established such as Azerbaijan Technical University, Azerbaijan University of Languages and the Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University. After 1991 when Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, the fall of communism led to the development of a number of private institutions, including Qafqaz University and Khazar University which are considered the most prestigious academic institutions. Apart from the private universities, the government established the Academy of Public Administration, the Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy and various military academies. The largest universities according to the student population are Baku State University and Azerbaijan State Economic University. In addition, there are the Baku Music Academy and the Azerbaijan National Conservatoire in Baku established in the early 1920s. Publicly run kindergartens and elementary schools (years 1 through 11) are operated by local wards or municipal offices.\nThe Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, the main state research organisation in Azerbaijan is locating in Baku as well. Moreover, Baku has numerous libraries, many of which contain vast collections of historic documents from the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Soviet periods, as well as from other civilisations of the past. The most important libraries in terms of historic document collections include the Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature, the National Library of Azerbaijan, the Mirza Alakbar Central Library, the Samad Vurgun Library and Baku Presidential Library.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has many public and private hospitals, clinics and laboratories within its bounds and numerous medical research centres. Many of these facilities have high technology equipment, which has contributed to the recent upsurge in \"medical tourism\" to Baku, particularly from post-Soviet countries such as Georgia and Moldova, whose governments send lower-income patients to the city for inexpensive high-tech medical treatments and operations.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nBecause of its intermittent periods of great prosperity as well as being the largest city in the Caucasus and one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse in the Soviet Union, Baku prides itself on having produced a disproportionate number of notable figures in the sciences, arts and other fields. Some of the houses they resided in display commemorative plaques. Some of the many prestigious residents include: Academy Award winners Rustam Ibrahimbeyov and Vladimir Menshov, one of the founders and head of the Soviet space program Kerim Kerimov, Nobel Prize winner and physicist Lev Landau and famous musicians such as Gara Garayev, Uzeyir Hajibeyov, Muslim Magomayev, Vagif Mustafazadeh and Alim Qasimov. World-famous cellist Mstislav Rostropovich was born and raised in Baku, as was world-famous chess player Garry Kasparov.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nBaku is twinned with:[in chronological order]\n\n\n=== Partner cities ===\nAberdeen, Scotland\nBerlin, Germany\nMainz, Germany\nStavanger, NorwayPartnership relations also exist at different levels with: Paris, Vienna, Tbilisi, Nur-Sultan, Minsk, Moscow, Volgograd, Kizlyar, Tashkent and Chengdu.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n1920 Baku Congress\nAdministrative divisions of Azerbaijan\nAteshgah of Baku\nGanja\nList of cities in Azerbaijan\nMingachevir\nNakhchivan\nSumgait\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUNESCO/ICOMOS (29 April 2003). \"Joint UNESCO-ICOMOS Mission to the Walled City of Baku\".

        "wiki": "Taza Pir Mosque (also Tazapir, Teze Pir, Teze-Pir, Tezepir) is a mosque in Baku, Azerbaijan. Its construction began in 1905 and was finished by 1914. The idea for the mosque as well as its financing was provided by an Azeri philanthropist, a female, Nabat Khanum Ashurbeyov (Ashurbeyli)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the sanctuary dates back to the XIV and XV centuries. It existed first time as a tomb. The tomb belonged to Abu Seyid Abdulla who was a scholar and Islamic saint. The location of the sanctuary was known as \u201cXalfadam\u201d until the middle of the last century. Over time, the tomb of Abu Seid Abdulla was exposed to destruction. However, the local population of Baku especially the Baku elites restored it several times. In 1817, son-in-law of Huseyngulu Khan, Qasim Bey financed restoration costs of the mosque. The actual construction of the temple began in the early 20th century. The construction of the mosque was started by construction foreman Karbalai Ahmed, and then completed under the direction of the architect Zivar bey Ahmadbay between 1905 and 1914 approximately 90 years later restoration of the tomb. The mosque was built on the tomb. The construction costs were met by Azerbaijani philanthropist Nabat Khanum Ashurbeyova. The construction of the Taza Pir Mosque took more than nine years due to financial and political issues of that time. Nabat Khanum, who financed several charitable projects simultaneously in Baku, could not afford to complete the mosque. In addition, due to breakout of Balkan War in 1911, Tsarist Russia had strictly controlled the activities of banks in Baku, assuming that Muslim millionaires could help the Ottoman Empire so that the Baku millionaires had to get the approval of officials from the Tsarist Department for the amount to be spent on the construction of Taza Pir Mosque.\nAzerbaijani national industrial magnate and philanthropist Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev also actively attended in the construction process of the mosque.Only 3 years after opening the mosque was closed in connection with the October Revolution in 1917. Over the years the mosque functioned as a cinema and a barn, and since 1943 to present day - as a mosque. Akhund of the mosque is the Grand Mufti of the Caucasus Allahshukur Pashazadeh.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Taza Pir Mosque was the first religious building that white stone was used in its construction in Baku city at that time. Architect Zivar bey Ahmedbayov designed the interior of the mosque in accordance with architectural examples of the Muslim East. The Taza Pir Mosque was considered a completely new stage, not only in the urban structure of Baku but also in the religious buildings of Absheron, due to architectural features. The facade of the Taza Pir Mosque is composed of porticos and minarets that rise from the flanks. According to the project, a square-shaped worship hall (19.6x19.6m) is complemented by huge domes. In interior decorations, local architectural elements were used. Taza Pir Mosque has a large-sized worship hall of. There are examples of calligraphy from holy book Koran written inside and outside of the mosque, as well as on the minarets. Between 2006 and 2009 the mosque underwent construction work and the old and detrited parts were restored. After restoration processes, the mosque provided with a ventilation system and its floor covered Namazgah carpet in which 720 people can worship at the same time. Interior of the mosque has an area of 1400 square meters and decorated with ornaments of painting schools of Azerbaijan plus with samples from eastern ornaments. The height of the dome and a half meters. The mihrab and dome of the mosque made of marble, while decorative elements of the mosque, the tops of minarets and labels are made of gold.\nThe dome, on which 6 times written La ilaha ilallah from Muslim proclamation of faith or Shahada, made from Q\u0131z\u0131lqaya (Gyzylgaya) stone.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Richard Sorge (4 October 1895 \u2013 7 November 1944) was a German journalist and Soviet military intelligence officer who was active before and during World War II and worked undercover as a German journalist in both Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan. His codename was \"Ramsay\" (Russian: \u0420\u0430\u043c\u0437\u0430\u0301\u0439). A number of famous personalities considered him one of the most accomplished spies.\nSorge is most famous for his service in Japan in 1940 and 1941, when he provided information about Adolf Hitler's plan to attack the Soviet Union. Then, in mid-September 1941, he informed the Soviets that Japan would not attack the Soviet Union in the near future. A month later, Sorge was arrested in Japan for espionage. He was tortured, forced to confess, tried and hanged in November 1944. \nHe was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1964.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nSorge was born on 4 October 1895 in the settlement of Sabunchi, a suburb of Baku, Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire now in Azerbaijan. He was the youngest of the nine children of Gustav Wilhelm Richard Sorge (1852 \u2013 1907), a German mining engineer employed by the Deutsche Petroleum-Aktiengesellschaft (DPAG) and the Caucasian oil company Branobel and his Russian wife Nina Semionovna Kobieleva. His father moved back to Germany with his family in 1898, after his lucrative contract expired. In Sorge's own words,\n\nThe one thing that made my life a little different from the average was a strong awareness of the fact that I had been born in the southern Caucasus and that we had moved to Berlin when I was very small.\nSorge attended Oberrealschule Lichterfelde when he was six.Sorge describes his father as having political views that were \"unmistakably nationalist and imperialist\", which he shared as a young man.The cosmopolitan Sorge household was \"very different from the average bourgeois home in Berlin\".Sorge considered Friedrich Adolf Sorge, an associate of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, to be his grandfather, but he was actually Sorge's great-uncle.Sorge enlisted in the Imperial German Army in October 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. At 18, he was posted to a field artillery battalion with the 3rd Guards Division. He served on the Western Front and was severely wounded there in March 1916. Shrapnel severed three of his fingers and broke both his legs, causing a lifelong limp. He was promoted to the rank of corporal, received the Iron Cross and was later medically discharged. While fighting in the war, Sorge, who had started out in 1914 as a right-wing nationalist, became disillusioned by what he called the \"meaninglessness\" of the war and moved to the left.During his convalescence, he read Marx and became a communist, mainly by the influence of the father of a nurse with whom he had developed a relationship. He spent the rest of the war studying economics at the universities of Berlin, Kiel and Hamburg. Sorge received his doctorate in political science (Dr. rer. pol.) from Hamburg in August 1919. He also joined the Communist Party of Germany. His political views, however, got him fired from both a teaching job and coal mining work. He emigrated to the Soviet Union, where he became a junior agent for the Comintern in Moscow.\n\n\n== Soviet military intelligence agent ==\nSorge was recruited as an agent for Soviet intelligence. With the cover of a journalist, he was sent to various European countries to assess the possibility of communist revolutions.\nFrom 1920 to 1922, Sorge lived in Solingen, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was joined there by Christiane Gerlach, the ex-wife of Kurt Albert Gerlach, a wealthy communist and professor of political science in Kiel, who had taught Sorge. Christiane Gerlach later remembered about meeting Sorge for the first time: \"It was as if a stroke of lightning ran through me. In this one second something awoke in me that had slumbered until now, something dangerous, dark, inescapable...\". Sorge and Christiane married in May 1921. In 1922, he was relocated to Frankfurt, where he gathered intelligence about the business community. In the summer of 1923, he took part in the Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche (\"First Marxist Work Week\") Conference in Ilmenau. Sorge continued his work as a journalist and also helped organize the library of the Institute for Social Research, a new Marxist think tank in Frankfurt.\nIn 1924, he and Christiane moved to Moscow, where he officially joined the International Liaison Department of the Comintern, which was also an OGPU intelligence-gathering body. Apparently, Sorge's dedication to duty led to his divorce. In 1929, Sorge became part of the Red Army's Fourth Department (the later GRU, or military intelligence). He remained with the Department for the rest of his life.\nIn 1929, Sorge went to the United Kingdom to study the labor movement there, the status of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the country's political and economic conditions. He was instructed to remain undercover and to stay out of politics.\nIn November 1929, Sorge was sent to Germany. He was instructed to join the Nazi Party and not to associate with any left-wing activists. As cover, he got a job with the agricultural newspaper Deutsche Getreide-Zeitung.\n\n\n=== China 1930 ===\nIn 1930, Sorge was sent to Shanghai. His cover was his work as the editor of a German news service and for the Frankfurter Zeitung. He contacted another agent, Max Clausen. Sorge also met the German Soviet agent Ursula Kuczynski and the American journalist Agnes Smedley. A well-known left-wing journalist, Smedley also worked for the Frankfurter Zeitung, and she introduced Sorge to Hotsumi Ozaki of the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun (a future Sorge recruit) and to Hanako Ishii, with whom he would become romantically involved.As a journalist, Sorge established himself as an expert on Chinese agriculture. In that role, he travelled around the country and contacted members of the Chinese Communist Party. In January 1932, Sorge reported on fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in the streets of Shanghai. In December, he was recalled to Moscow.\n\n\n=== Moscow 1933 ===\nSorge returned to Moscow, where he wrote a book about Chinese agriculture. He also married Yekaterina Maximova (\"Katya\"), a woman he had met in China and brought back with him to Russia.\n\n\n=== Japan 1933 ===\n\nIn May 1933, the GRU decided to have Sorge organize an intelligence network in Japan. He was given the codename \"Ramsay\" (\"\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0437\u0430\u0439\" Ramzai or Ramzay). He first went to Berlin, to renew contacts in Germany and to obtain a new newspaper assignment in Japan as cover. In September 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army had seized the Manchuria region of China, which gave Japan another land border in Asia with the Soviet Union (previously, the Soviet Union and Japan had shared only the island of Sakhalin). At the time, several Kwantung Army generals advocated following up the seizure of Manchuria by invading the Soviet Far East, and as the Soviets had broken the Japanese Army codes, Moscow was aware of that and caused a \"major Japanese war scare\" in the winter of 1931\u20131932. Until the mid-1930s, it was Japan, rather than Germany, that was considered to be the main threat by Moscow.Elsa Poretsky, the wife of Ignace Reiss, a fellow GPU agent, commented: \"His joining the Nazi Party in his own country, where he had a well documented police record was hazardous, to say the least... his staying in the very lion's den in Berlin, while his application for membership was being processed, was indeed flirting with death\".In Berlin, he insinuated himself into the Nazi Party and read Nazi propaganda, particularly Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Sorge attended so many beer halls with his new acquaintances that he gave up drinking to avoid saying anything inappropriate. His abstinence from drinking did not make his Nazi companions suspicious. It was an example of his devotion to and absorption in his mission, as he had been a heavy drinker. He later explained to Hede Massing, \"That was the bravest thing I ever did. Never will I be able to drink enough to make up for this time\". Later, his drinking came to undermine his work.\nIn Germany, he received commissions from two newspapers, the Berliner B\u00f6rsen Zeitung and the T\u00e4gliche Rundschau, to report from Japan and the Nazi theoretical journal Geopolitik. Sorge was so successful at establishing his cover as an intensely-Nazi journalist that when he departed Germany, Joseph Goebbels even attended his farewell dinner. He went to Japan via the United States, passing through New York in August 1933.Sorge arrived in Yokohama on 6 September 1933. After landing in Japan, Sorge became the Japan correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung. As it was the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, Sorge's status as the Tokyo correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung made him, in many ways, the most senior German reporter in Japan. Sorge's reputation as a Nazi journalist who detested the Soviet Union served as an excellent cover for his espionage work. Sorge was told by his GRU superiors that his mission in Japan was to \"give very careful study to the question of whether or not Japan was planning to attack the USSR\". After his arrest in 1941, Sorge told his captors:\n\nThis was for many years the most important duty assigned to me and my group; it would not be far wrong to say that it was the sole object of my mission in Japan.... The USSR, as it viewed the prominent role and attitude taken by the Japanese military in foreign policy after the Manchurian incident, had come to harbor a deeply implanted suspicion that Japan was planning to attack the Soviet Union, a suspicion so strong that my frequently expressed opinions to the contrary were not always fully appreciated in Moscow....\nHe was warned by his commanders not to have contact with either the underground Japanese Communist Party or the Soviet embassy in Tokyo. His intelligence network in Japan included the Red Army officer and radio operator Max Clausen, Hotsumi Ozaki and two other Comintern agents, Branko Vukeli\u0107, a journalist working for the French magazine, Vu, and a Japanese journalist, Miyagi Yotoku, who was employed by the English-language newspaper, the Japan Advertiser. Max Clausen's wife, Anna, acted as ring courier from time to time. From summer 1937, Clausen operated under the cover of his business, M Clausen Shokai, suppliers of blueprint machinery and reproduction services. The business had been set up with Soviet funds but, in time, became a commercial success. Ozaki was a Japanese man from a very influential family that had grown up in Taiwan then a Japanese colony, and he was an idealistic Sinophile who believed that Japan, which had started its modernisation bu the Meiji Restoration, had much to teach China. However, Ozaki was shocked by the racism of Japanese policy towards China with the Chinese being depicted as a people fit only to be slaves. Ozaki believed that the existing political system of Japan, with the emperor being worshipped as a living god, had to go, and to save Japan from fascism required that Japan be \"reconstructed as a socialist state\".Between 1933 and 1934, Sorge formed a network of informants. His agents had contacts with senior politicians and picked up information on Japanese foreign policy. His agent Ozaki developed a close contact with Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Ozaki copied secret documents for Sorge.\nAs he appeared to be an ardent Nazi, Sorge was welcome at the German embassy. One Japanese journalist who knew Sorge described him in 1935 as \"a typical, swashbuckling, arrogant Nazi... quick-tempered, hard-drinking\". As the Japan correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung, Sorge developed a network of sources ob Japanese politics, and soon, German diplomats, including the ambassador Herbert von Dirksen, came to depend upon Sorge as a source of intelligence on the fractious and secretive world of Japanese politics. The Japanese values of honne and tatemae (the former literally means \"true sound\", roughly \"as things are\", and the latter literally means \"fa\u00e7ade\" or roughly \"as things appear\"), the tendency of the Japanese to hide their real feelings and profess to believe in things that they do not, made deciphering Japan's politics especially difficult. That Sorge was fluent in Japanese further enhanced his status as a Japanologist. Sorge was very interested in Asian history and culture, especially those of China and Japan, and when he was sober, he tried to learn as much as he could. Meanwhile, Sorge befriended General Eugen Ott, the German military attach\u00e9 to Japan and seduced his wife, Helma. A military attache, Ott sent reports back to Berlin containing his assessments of the Imperial Japanese Army, which Helma Ott copied and passed on to Sorge, who, in turn, passed them on to Moscow (Helma Ott believed Sorge to be working merely for the Nazi Party). As the Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, German influence was strong and so Ott had good contacts with Japanese officers.In October 1934, Ott and Sorge made an extended visit to the puppet \"Empire of Manchukuo\", which was actually a Japanese colony, and Sorge, who knew the Far East far better than Ott, wrote up the report describing Manchukuo that Ott submitted to Berlin under his name. As Ott's report was received very favourably at both the Bendlerstrasse and the Wilhelmstrasse, Sorge soon became one of Ott's main sources of information about the Japanese Empire, which created a very close friendship between the two. In 1935, Sorge passed on to Moscow a planning document provided to him by Ozaki, which strongly suggested that Japan was not planning on attacking the Soviet Union in 1936. Sorge guessed correctly that Japan would invade China in July 1937 and that there was no danger of a Japanese invasion of Siberia.On 26 February 1936, an attempted military coup took place in Tokyo. It was meant to achieve a mystical \"Sh\u014dwa Restoration\" and led to several senior officials being murdered by the rebels. Dirksen, Ott and the rest of the German embassy were highly confused as to why it was happening and were at a loss as to how to explain the coup to the Wilhelmstrasse. They turned to Sorge, the resident Japan expert, for help. Using notes supplied to him by Ozaki, Sorge submitted a report stating that the Imperial Way Faction in the Japanese Army, which had attempted the coup, was younger officers from rural backgrounds who were upset at the impoverishment of the countryside, and that the faction was not communist or socialist but just anticapitalist and believed that big business had subverted the emperor's will. Sorge's report was used as the basis of Dirksen's explanation of the coup attempt, which he sent back to the Wilhelmstrasse, which was well satisfied at the ambassador's \"brilliant\" explanation of the coup attempt.Sorge lived in a house in a respectable neighborhood in Tokyo, where he was noted mostly for heavy drinking and his reckless way of riding his motorcycle. In the summer of 1936, a Japanese woman, Hanako Ishii, a waitress at a bar frequented by Sorge, moved into Sorge's house to become his common-law wife. Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, his most durable and lasting one was with Ishii, who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a way that everyone viewed as almost suicidal. An American reporter who knew Sorge later wrote that he \"created the impression of being a playboy, almost a wastrel, the very antithesis of a keen and dangerous spy\".Ironically, Sorge's spying for the Soviets in Japan in the late 1930s was probably safer for him than if he had been in Moscow. Claiming too many pressing responsibilities, he disobeyed Josef Stalin's orders to return to the Soviet Union in 1937 during the Great Purge, as he realised the risk of arrest because of his German citizenship. In fact, two of Sorge's earliest GRU handlers, Yan Karlovich Berzin and his successor, Artur Artuzov, were shot during the purges. In 1938, the German ambassador to Britain, Joachim von Ribbentrop was promoted to foreign minister, and to replace Ribbentrop, Dirksen was sent to London. Ribbentrop promoted Ott to be Dirksen's replacement. Ott, now aware that Sorge was sleeping with his wife, let his friend Sorge have \"free run of the embassy night and day\", as one German diplomat later recalled. Ott tolerated Sorge's affair with his wife on the grounds that Sorge was such a charismatic man that women always fell in love with him and so it was only natural that Sorge would sleep with his wife. Ott liked to call Sorge Richard der Unwiderstehliche (\"Richard the Irresistible\"), as his charm made him very attractive to women. Ott greatly valued Sorge as a source of information about the secretive world of Japanese politics, especially Japan's war with China, since Ott found that Sorge knew so many things about Japan that no other Westerner knew that he chose to overlook Sorge's affair with his wife.After Ott became the ambassador to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had breakfast with him every day and they discussed German\u2013Japanese relations in detail, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge so much that he sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong and Manila. Sorge noted about his influence in the German embassy: \"They would come to me and say, 'we have found out such and such a thing, have you heard about it and what do you think'?\"\nOn 13 May 1938, while he rode his motorcycle down the streets of Tokyo, a very-intoxicated Sorge crashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes given to him by Ozaki at the time, if the police had discovered the documents, his cover would have been blown. However, a member of his spy ring managed to get to the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan had been caused by overzealous officers in the Kwantung Army and that there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war against the Soviet Union. Unaware that his friend Berzin had been shot as a \"Trotskyite\" in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938:\n\nDear Comrade! Don't worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows who are ready to carry out the tasks connected with our great mission. I send sincere greetings to you and your friends. I request you to forward the attached letter and greetings to my wife. Please, take the time to see to her welfare.\nSorge never learned that Berzin had been shot as a traitor.The two most authoritative sources for intelligence for the Soviet Union on Germany in the late 1930s were Sorge and Rudolf von Scheliha, the First Secretary at the German embassy in Warsaw. Unlike Sorge, who believed in communism, Scheliha's reasons for spying were money problems since he had a lifestyle beyond his salary as a diplomat, and he turned to selling secrets to provide additional income. Scheliha sold documents to the NKVD indicating that Germany was planning from late 1938 to turn Poland into a satellite state, and after the Poles refused to fall into line, Germany planned to invade Poland from March 1939 onward. Sorge reported that Japan did not intend for the border war with the Soviet Union that began in May 1939 to escalate into all-out war. Sorge also reported that the attempt to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance was floundering since the Germans wanted the alliance to be directed against Britain, but the Japanese wanted the alliance to be directed against the Soviets. Sorge's reports that the Japanese did not plan to invade Siberia were disbelieved in Moscow and on 1 September 1939, Sorge was attacked in a message from Moscow:\n\nJapan must have commenced important movements (military and political) in preparation for war against the Soviet Union but you have not provided any appreciable information. Your activity seems to getting slack.\n\n\n=== Wartime intelligence ===\n\nSorge supplied Soviet intelligence with information about the Anti-Comintern Pact and the German-Japanese Pact. In 1941, his embassy contacts made him learn of Operation Barbarossa, the imminent Axis invasion of the Soviet Union and even the approximate date. On 30 May 1941, Sorge reported to Moscow, \"Berlin informed Ott that German attack will commence in the latter part of June. Ott 95 percent certain war will commence\". On 20 June 1941, Sorge reported: \"Ott told me that war between Germany and the USSR is inevitable.... Invest [the code name for Ozaki] told me that the Japanese General Staff is already discussing what position to take in the event of war\". Moscow received the reports, but Stalin and other top Soviet leaders ultimately ignored Sorge's warnings, as well as those of other sources, including early false alarms.It has been rumoured that Sorge provided the exact date of \"Barbarossa\", but the historian Gordon Prange in 1984 concluded that the closest Sorge came was 20 June 1941 and that Sorge himself never claimed to have discovered the correct date (22 June) in advance. The date of 20 June was given to Sorge by Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant-Colonel) Erwin Scholl, the deputy military attach\u00e9 at the German embassy.  On a dispatch he sent the GRU on June 1, which read, \"Expected start of German-Soviet war around June 15 is based on information Lt. Colonel Scholl brought with him from Berlin... for Ambassador Ott\". Despite knowing that Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union sometime in May or June 1941, Sorge was still shocked on 22 June 1941, when he learned of Operation Barbarossa. He went to a bar to get drunk and repeated in English: \"Hitler's a fucking criminal! A murderer. But Stalin will teach the bastard a lesson. You just wait and see!\" The Soviet press reported in 1964 that on 15 June 1941, Sorge had sent a radio dispatch saying, \"The war will begin on June 22\". Prange, who despite not having access to material released by the Russian authorities in the 1990s, did not accept the veracity of that report. Stalin was quoted as having ridiculed Sorge and his intelligence before \"Barbarossa\":\n\nThere's this bastard who's set up factories and brothels in Japan and even deigned to report the date of the German attack as 22 June. Are you suggesting I should believe him too?\nIn late June 1941, Sorge informed Moscow that Ozaki had learned the Japanese cabinet had decided to occupy the southern half of French Indochina (now Vietnam) and that invading the Soviet Union was being considered as an option, but for the moment, Japanese Prime Minister Konoye had decided on neutrality. On 2 July 1941, an Imperial Conference attended by the emperor, Konoye and the senior military leaders approved of occupying all of French Indochina and to reinforce the Kwantung Army for a possible invasion of the Soviet Union. At the bottom of the report, the deputy chief of the Soviet general staff wrote, \"In consideration of the high reliability and accuracy of previous information and the competence of the information sources, this information can be trusted\". In July 1941, Sorge reported that German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop had ordered Ott to start pressuring the Japanese to attack the Soviet Union but that the Japanese were resisting the pressure. On 25 August 1941, Sorge reported to Moscow: \"Invest [Ozaki] was able to learn from circles closest to Konoye... that the High Command... discussed whether they should go to war with the USSR. They decided not to launch the war within this year, repeat, not to launch the war this year\". On 6 September 1941, an Imperial Conference decided against war with the Soviet Union and ordered for Japan to start preparations for a possible war against the United States and the British Empire, which Ozaki reported to Sorge. At the same time, Ott told Sorge that all of his efforts to get Japan to attack the Soviet Union had failed. On 14 September 1941, Sorge reported to Moscow, \"In the careful judgment of all of us here... the possibility of [Japan] launching an attack, which existed until recently, has disappeared....\" Sorge advised the Red Army on 14 September 1941 that Japan would not attack the Soviet Union until:\n\nMoscow had been captured.\nThe Kwantung Army had become three times the size of Soviet Far Eastern forces.\nA civil war had started in Siberia.This information made possible the transfer of Soviet divisions from the Far East, although the presence of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria necessitated the Soviet Union's keeping a large number of troops on the eastern borders....\nVarious writers have speculated that the information allowed the release of Siberian divisions for the Battle of Moscow, where the German Army suffered its first strategic defeat in the war. To that end, Sorge's information might have been the most important military intelligence work in World War II. However, Sorge was not the only source of Soviet intelligence about Japan, as Soviet codebreakers had broken the Japanese diplomatic codes and so Moscow knew from signals intelligence that there would be no Japanese attack on the Soviet Union in 1941.Another important item allegedly reported by Sorge may have affected the Battle of Stalingrad. Sorge reported that Japan would attack the Soviet Union from the east as soon as the German army captured any city on the Volga.Sorge's rival and opponent in Japan and East Asia was Ivar Lissner, an agent of the German Abwehr.\n\n\n== Arrests and trials ==\nAs the war progressed, Sorge was in increasing danger but continued his service. His radio messages were enciphered with unbreakable one-time pads, which were always used by the Soviet intelligence agencies and appeared as gibberish. However, the increasing number of the mystery messages made the Japanese began to suspect that an intelligence ring was operating. Sorge was also coming under increasing suspicion in Berlin. By 1941, the Nazis had instructed SS Standartenf\u00fchrer Josef Albert Meisinger, the \"Butcher of Warsaw\", who was the Gestapo resident at the German embassy in Tokyo, to begin monitoring Sorge and his activities. Sorge was able, through one of his lovers, Margarete Harich-Schneider, a German musician living in Japan, to gain the key to Meisinger's apartment since it had once been her apartment. Much to his relief, he learned that Meisinger had concluded that the allegations that Sorge was a Soviet agent were groundless, and Sorge's loyalty was to Germany. Sorge befriended Meisinger by playing on his principal weakness, alcohol, and spent much time getting him drunk, which contributed to Meisinger's favourable evaluation of Sorge. Meisinger reported to Berlin that the friendship between Ott and Sorge \"was now so close that all normal reports from attach\u00e9s to Berlin became mere appendages to the overall report written by Sorge and signed by the Ambassador\". The Kempeitai, the Japanese secret police), intercepted many messages and began to close in against the German Soviet agent. Sorge's penultimate message to Moscow in October 1941 reported, \"The Soviet Far East can be considered safe from Japanese attack\". In his last message to Moscow, Sorge asked to be sent back to Germany, as there was no danger of a Japanese attack on the Soviet Union, and he wished to aid the Soviet war effort by providing more intelligence about the German war effort. Ozaki was arrested on 14 October 1941 and immediately interrogated. As the Kempeitai trailed Sorge, it discovered that Ott's wife was a regular visitor to Sorge's house and that he had spent his last night as a free man sleeping with her.Sorge was arrested shortly thereafter, on 18 October 1941, in Tokyo. The next day, a brief Japanese memo notified  Ott that Sorge had been swiftly arrested \"on suspicion of espionage\", together with Max Clausen. Ott was both surprised and outraged as a result and assumed that it was a case of \"Japanese espionage hysteria\". He thought that Sorge had been discovered to have passed secret information on the Japan-American negotiations to the German embassy and also that the arrest could have been caused by anti-German elements within the Japanese government. Nonetheless, he immediately agreed with Japanese authorities to \"investigate the incident fully\". It was not until a few months later that Japanese authorities announced that Sorge had actually been indicted as a Soviet agent.He was incarcerated in Sugamo Prison. Initially, the Japanese believed, because of his Nazi Party membership and German ties, that Sorge had been an Abwehr agent. However, the Abwehr denied that he had been one of their agents. Under torture, Sorge confessed, but the Soviet Union denied he was a Soviet agent. The Japanese made three overtures to the Soviet Union and offered to trade Sorge for one of their own spies. However, the Soviet Union declined all of the Japanese attempts and maintained that Sorge was unknown to them.In September 1942, Sorge's wife, Katya Maximova, was arrested by the NKVD on the charges that she was a \"German spy\" since she was married to the German citizen Sorge (the fact that Sorge was a GRU agent did not matter to the NKVD), and she was deported to the gulag, where she died in 1943. Hanako Ishii, the Japanese woman who loved Sorge and the only woman whom Sorge loved in return, was the only person who tried to visit Sorge during his time in Sugamo Prison. During one of her visits, she expressed concern that Sorge, under torture by the Kempeitai, would name her as involved in his spy ring, but he promised her that he would never mention her name to the Kempeitai. The Kempeitai was much feared in Japan for its use of torture as an investigation method. Sorge ultimately struck a deal with the Kempeitai that if it spared Ishii and the wives of the other members of the spy ring, he would reveal all. Ishii was never arrested by the Kempeitai Sorge told his Kempeital captors:\n\nThat I successfully approached the German embassy in Japan and won the absolute trust by people there was the foundation of my organisation in Japan.... Even in Moscow that fact that I infiltrated into the centre of the embassy and made use of it for my spying activity is evaluated as extremely amazing, having no equivalent in history.\n\nAfter the arrest of Sorge, Meisinger used the increased spy fear of the Japanese to fraudulently denounce \"anti-Nazis\" as \"Soviet spies\" to the Japanese authorities. He was responsible for the persecution, the internment and the torture of the \"Schindler\" of Tokyo, Willy Rudolf Foerster. Foerster was forced to sell his company, which had employed a sizable number of Jewish refugees from Germany and the countries occupied by Germany. He and his Japanese wife survived, but after the war, the same former German diplomats, who had denounced and persecuted him as an \"anti-Nazi\", would discredit him.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSorge was hanged on 7 November 1944, at 10:20 Tokyo time in Sugamo Prison and was pronounced dead 19 minutes later. Hotsumi Ozaki had been hanged earlier in the same day. Sorge's body was not cremated because of wartime fuel shortages. He was buried in the nearby Zoshigaya Cemetery.Sorge was survived by his mother, then living in Germany, and he left his estate to Anna Clausen, the wife of his radio operator.After hounding the American occupation authorities, Sorge's Japanese lover, Hanako Ishii (1911 \u2013 1 July 2000), located and recovered his skeleton on 16 November 1949. After identifying him by his distinctive dental work and a poorly-set broken leg, she took his body away and had him cremated at the Shimo-Ochiai Cremation Centre. Nearly a year later l, she had his ashes interred in Section 17, Area 1, Row 21, Plot 16 at Tama Cemetery in Fuch\u016b, Tokyo. She had erected a black marble tombstone bearing the epitaph, which reads in Japanese: \"Here lies a hero who sacrificed his life fighting against war and for world peace\".She kept his own teeth, belt and spectacles and had made a ring of his gold bridgework, which she wore for the rest of her life. After her death, her own ashes were interred beside his.\nThe Soviet Union did not officially acknowledge Sorge until 1964.It was argued that Sorge's biggest coup led to his undoing because Stalin could not afford to let it become known that he had rejected Sorge's warning about the German attack in June 1941. However, nations seldom officially recognise their own undercover agents.\n\n\n== Posthumous recognition ==\n\nInitially, Sorge's reputation in West Germany in the 1950s was highly negative, with Sorge depicted as a traitor working for the Soviet Union who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Wehrmacht soldiers in the winter of 1941\u20131942. The 1950s were a transition moment in the German memory of Nazi Germany, as its German supporters sought a version of history that presented them as victims, rather than as followers, of Hitler. They portrayed Nazism as an aberration in German history that had no connections to traditional Prussian values, portrayed the Wehrmacht as an honourable fighting force that had nothing to do with the Holocaust and presented the Soviets as guilty of crimes that were even more horrific than those committed by the Nazis. That way of remembering the Nazi past in the 1950s caused Operation Barbarossa and Germany's war on the Eastern Front to be seen as a heroic and legitimate war against the Soviet Union of which Germans should unashamed.The first tentative efforts at changing the memory of the Nazi past started in the early 1950s, when German President Theodor Heuss gave a speech on 20 July 1954 that praisef the putsch attempt of 20 July 1944. He argued that \"the men of July 20th\" were patriots rather than traitors, which was then a bold gesture. The first effort to present Sorge in a positive light occurred in the summer of 1953, when the influential publisher Rudolf Augstein wrote a 17-part series in his magazine, Der Spiegel. He argued that Sorge was not a Soviet agent but a heroic German patriot opposed to the Nazi regime whose motivation in providing intelligence to the Soviet Union was to bring down Hitler, rather than to support Stalin. Augstein also attacked Willoughby for his book The Shanghai Conspiracy that claimed that Sorge had caused the \"loss of China\" in 1949 and that the Sorge spy ring was in the process of taking over the U.S. government. Augstein argued that Willoughby and his fans had completely misunderstood that Sorge's espionage was directed against Germany and Japan, not the U.S.Such was the popularity of Augstein's articles that the German author Hans Hellmut Kirst published a spy novel featuring Sorge as the hero, and Hans-Otto Meissner wrote the book Der Fall Sorge (The Sorge Case) that was a cross between a novel and a history by blending fact and fiction together with a greater emphasis on the latter. Meissner had served as third secretary at the German Embassy in Tokyo and had known Sorge. Meissner's book, which was written as a thriller that engaged in \"orientalism\", portrayed Japan as a strange, mysterious country in which the enigmatic and charismatic master spy Sorge operated to infiltrate both its government and the German embassy. Meissner presented Sorge as the consummate spy, a cool professional who was dressed in a rumpled trench coat and fedora and was a great womanizer, and much of the book is concerned with Sorge's various relationships.Later on, Meissner presented Sorge as a rather megalomaniac figure and, in the process, changed Sorge's motivation from loyalty to communism to colossal egoism. He had Sorge rant about his equal dislike for both Stalin and Hitler and had him say that he that supplied only enough information to both regimes to manipulate them into destroying each other sknce it suited him to play one against the other. At the book's climax, Sorge agreed to work for the American Office of Strategic Services, in exchange for being settled to settle in Hawaii, and he was in the process of learning that Japan is planning on bombing Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, but his love of women proved to be his undoing as the Japanese dancer Kiyomi rejected his sexual advances. Sorge finally seduced Kiyomi but lost valuable time, which allowed the Kempeitai to arrest him.The American historian Cornelius Partsch noted some striking aspects of Meissner's book such as his complete exoneration of the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt from any involvement in the criminal aspects of the Nazi regime. Meissner had Sorge constantly breaking into offices to steal information, which he did not do, as security at the German embassy was sloppy, and Sorge was trusted as an apparently-dedicated Nazi journalist and so breaking into offices would have been unnecessary. Meissner avoided any mention of SS Standartenf\u00fchrer Josef Albert Meisinger, the \"Butcher of Warsaw\" who was stationed at the German embassy as the police attach\u00e9 to Japan. Partsch wrote that Meissner gave Sorge almost-superhuman abilities at lockbreaking, as he broke into various offices, safes and filing cabinets with the greatest ease, but in reality, secret documents were all too often left out in the open in unlocked rooms, and Sorge was allowed to wander about the embassy without an escort. Meissner portrayed the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt in the traditional manner, as a glamorous, elitist group that operated in exotic places like Japan serving Germany, not the Nazi regime.Kirst's book Die letzte Karte spielt der Tod was a novel that offered a considerably more realistic picture than Meissner's romanticised portrayal of Sorge. Kirst portrayed Sorge as an existential hero, a deeply-traumatized veteran of World War I, whose sleep was constantly disturbed by horrific nightmares of his war service, and when he was awake, he suffered from frequent panic attacks. Kirst's book depicted Sorge as a \"lonely, desperate\" man, a tragic, wounded individual with a reckless streak who engaged in maniacal binge drinking, nearly-suicidal motorcycle riding across the Japanese countryside, and though he wanted love, he was incapable of maintaining lasting relationships. Unlike Meissner, Kirst had Meisinger appear as one of the book's villains by portraying him as an especially-loathsome and stupid SS officer, who fully deserved to be deceived by Sorge. As part of Kirst's portrayal of Sorge as a tragic man on the brink and as victim led him to portray Sorge's spying for the Soviet Union by forces beyond his control. Kirst was more forceful in his condemnation of National Socialism than Meissner as his book maintained that the regime was so monstrously evil that an existential man forever on the brink of a mental breakdown like Sorge ended up spying for the Soviet Union as the lesser evil.Partsch noted that both books were very much concerned with Sorge's womanising, which neither author exaggerated, but presented the aspect of his personality in different ways. Kirst portrayed Sorge's womanizing as part of the same self-destructive urges that led him to spy for the Soviet Union, but Meissner depicted Sorge's womanizing as part of his callous narcissism and as his principal weakness, as his desire for Kiyomi finally destroyed him. In turn, that led to different depictions of the male body. Meissner portrayed it as the seductive instrument that entices female desire and led women into ill-advised relationships with Sorge, whose body is perfectly fit and attractive to women. Kirst, by contrast, correctly noted that Sorge walked with a pronounced limp because of a war wound, which had Sorge sarcastically say was because of his \"gallantry\" in his book, and Sorge's wounded body served as a metaphor for his wounded soul. Partsch further commented that Meissner's book was a depoliticised and personalised account of the Sorge spy ring, as he omitted any mention of Hotsumi Ozaki, an idealistic man who sincerely believed his country was on the wrong course, and he portrayed Sorge as a \"Faustian man\" motivated only by his vanity to exercise \"a god-like power over the world\" and gave Sorge \"an overblown, pop-Nietzsche an sense of destiny\".The ultimate \"message\" of Meissner's book was that Sorge was an amoral, egoistical individual whose actions had nothing to do with ideology and that the only reason for Germany's defeat by the Soviet Union was Sorge's spying, which suggested that Germany lost the war only because of \"fate\". Meissner followed the \"great man\" interpretation of history that a few \"great men\" decide the events of the world, with everyone else reduced to passive bystanders. By contrast, Kirst pictured Sorge as a victim, as a mere pawn in a \"murderous chess game\" and emphasised Sorge's opposition to the Nazi regime as the motivation for his actions. Kirst further noted that Sorge was betrayed by his own masters as after his arrest, and the Soviet regime denounced him as a \"Trotskyite\" and made no effort to save him. Partsch concluded that the two rival interpretations of Sorge put forward in the novels by Meissner and Kirst in 1955 have shaped Sorge's image in the West, especially Germany, ever since their publication.In 1954, the West German film director Veit Harlan wrote and directed the film Verrat an Deutschland about Sorge's espionage in Japan. Harlan had been the favourite filmmaker of Nazi Information Minister Joseph Goebbels and directed many propaganda films, including Jud S\u00fcss. Harlan's film is a romantic drama, starring Harlan's wife, Kristina S\u00f6derbaum, as Sorge's love interest. The film was publicly premiered by the distributor before it passed the rating system and so was withdrawn from more-public performances and finally released after some editing had been done.In 1961, a movie, Qui \u00eates-vous, Monsieur Sorge ? (Who Are You, Mr. Sorge?), was produced in France in collaboration with West Germany, Italy, and Japan. It was very popular in the Soviet Union as well. Sorge was played by Thomas Holtzmann.On November 1964, twenty years after his death, the Soviet government awarded Sorge with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Sorge's widow, Hanako Ishii, received a Soviet and Russian pension until her death in July 2000 in Tokyo. In the 1960s, the KGB, seeking to improve its image in the Soviet Union, began the cult of the \"hero spy\" with former Chekists working abroad being celebrated as the great \"hero spies\" in books, films and newspapers. Sorge was one of those selected for \"hero spy\" status. In fact, the Soviets had broken Japanese codes in 1941 and had already known independently of the intelligence provided by Sorge that Japan had decided to \"strike south\" (attacking the United States and the British Empire), instead of \"striking north\" (attacking the Soviet Union).The Kremlin gave much greater attention to signals intelligence in evaluating threats from Japan from 1931 to 1941 than it did to the intelligence that was gathered by the Sorge spy ring, but since Soviet intelligence did not like to mention the achievements of its codebreakers, Soviet propaganda from 1964 onward gloried Sorge as a \"hero spy\" and avoided all mention that the Soviets had broken the Japanese codes. The Soviets, during the Cold War, liked to give the impression that all of their intelligence came from human intelligence, rather than signals intelligence, to prevent Western nations from knowing how much the Soviets collected from the latter source. A testament to Sorge's fame in the Soviet Union was that even though Sorge worked for the GRU, not the NKVD, it was the KGB, which had far more power than the Red Army, that claimed him as one of its \"hero spies\" in the 1960s.In 1965, three East German journalists published Dr Sorge funkt aus Tokyo in celebration of Sorge and his actions. Before the award, Sorge's claim that Friedrich Adolf Sorge was his grandfather was repeated in the Soviet press. In a strange Cold War oddity, the authors stirred up a free speech scandal with patriotic letters to former Nazis in West Germany, which caused the Verfassungsschutz to issue a stern warning in early 1967: \"If you receive mail from a certain Julius Mader, do not reply to him and pass on the letter to the respective security authorities\".\n In 1971, a comic book based on Sorge's life, Wywiadowca XX wieku (\"20th Century Intelligence Officer\"), was published in the People's Republic of Poland to familiarise younger readers with Sorge.\nThere is a monument to Sorge in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sorge also appears in Osamu Tezuka's Adolf manga. In his 1981 book, Their Trade is Treachery, the author Chapman Pincher asserted that Sorge, a GRU agent himself, recruited the Englishman Roger Hollis in China in the early 1930s to provide information. Hollis later returned to England, joined MI5 just before World War II began and eventually became the director-general of MI5 from 1956 to 1965. As detailed by former MI5 staffer Peter Wright in his 1988 book Spycatcher, Hollis was accused of being a Soviet agent, but despite several lengthy and seemingly-thorough investigations, no conclusive proof was ever obtained.\nOne of Aleksandar Hemon's first stories in English is \"The Sorge Spy Ring\" (TriQuarterly, 1997). The 2003 Japanese film Spy Sorge, directed by Masahiro Shinoda, details his exploits in Shanghai and in Japan. In the film, he is portrayed by the Scottish actor Iain Glen. In 2016, one of Moscow's Moscow Central Circle rail stations was named after Sorge (Zorge). A Russian television series, \"Richard Sorge. Master Spy\", was a twelve-episode series filmed in 2019.

It was funded by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, of which the First Lady is head. The foundation has also created projects with the Louvre Museum and the Palace of Versailles.  The museum is intended as a focus for an \"eco-cultural zone\" conceived of by Thomas Krens, former director of the Guggenheim Foundation, that will also include a white-sand beach, a Frank Gehry skyscraper, and a walkway that projects out over the Caspian Sea.The museum does not have fixed subject areas. The architectural concept of the museum avoids halls with corners and has open passages and walls that meet at different angles, creating a multidimensional perspective of exhibits. Conspicuous metallic structures and the use of the color white unite all parts into a single \"moving abstract structure.\" The chief designer of the museum is the artist Altay Sadikh-zadeh; the architect of the building is Jean Nouvel.\n\n\n== Displays ==\n\nThe museum focuses on the second half of the twentieth century and contains over 800 works by notable Azerbaijani painters and sculptors, particularly avant garde art of the 1960s and 1970s, including Rasim Babayev, Ashraf Murad, Gennady Brejatjuk, Fazil Najafov, Mamed Mustafaev, Aga Houssejnov, Ali Ibadullaev, Mir-Nadir Zeynalov, Fuad Salayev, Farhad Halilov, Darvin Velibekov, Eldar Mammadov, Mikail Abdurahmanov, Museib Amirov, Mahmud Rustamov, Huseyn Hagverdi, Eliyar Alimirzayev, Nazim Rahmanov, Rashad Babayev and Altay Sadikh-zadeh. There are also non-Azerbaijani modern masterworks by Salvador Dal\u00ed, Pablo Picasso, and Marc Chagall from private collectors.Exhibitions of Azerbaijani photographers such as Elnur Babayev, Fakhriya Mammadova, Ilkin Huseynov, Rena Efendi, Sergei Khrustalev, Sitara Ibrahimova, Tahmina Mammadova are often held in the museum.The museum includes a children's fine arts department, a video hall, a cafe, a restaurant, a separate hall for private exhibitions, a library, and a bookstore with materials pertaining to world art, architecture and sculpture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAzerbaijan State Museum of Art\nAzerbaijan State Carpet Museum\nAzerbaijan State Museum of History\nShusha Museum of History\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The museum is situated in the east of the city around a 15-20 minute walk from 28 May station. It is a large gallery laid out across two floors. The ground floor contains the more avant-garde work with more conventional paintings on the first floor. The vast majority of the",

          "Finally the Museum of Modern Art is open to the public, much later than scheduled but better late than never. The museum is open from 11 to 21hh except on Mondays, entrance is 5 Manat (about 3 US$). The exhibits are shown on 2 floors with a large atrium in the center from where",

          "Can't believe it - the museum was \"closed\", but cashiers (two!) were at their booth, and security was on site. The status on its Web for today is \"open\". If indeed it is not, why the museum does not indicate this on the Web site? Very disappointing. For an art institution to",

          "Gallery is still closed (as of 28th of April). It was strange, as the door was open, and two staff members sat in the ticket box. But both the security and one of their ticket sales people said the gallery was closed. When asked for further details, I was told it would be closed",
          "When I arrived at the museum the staff told me that it is being renovated and probably will reopen to the public in April 2018, adding inshallah, so I am not sure if it really will reopen in April 2018.",

          "I have traveled the world for two and a half years, visiting modern art museums in more capital cities than I can count, and this is without a doubt the worst one I have ever encountered. Starting with the rude and aggressive security on the door and finishing with the art, much",

          "Some reviews and some of the exciting architecture in Baku led us to believe this would be an excellent and stimulating gallery. It's an interesting open-plan building with white display spaces branching in all directions from the central atrium, but at least when we went there",
          "Very interesting collection of modern art (local artists and some artworks of world famous painters like Dali and Picasso). Definitely need to see this museum.",
          "I went first thing on a Sunday morning (it opens at 11) and had it to myself for 2 hours. Magical. Wonderful space - two floors with large atrium in middle like a glasshouse, green plants and white walls showing off the art magnificently. One of the staff members was nicely",
          "MIM is by far the best art museum I've been to and as a trained art historian, I go to these quite often. It's one of the latest additions to the cultural scene in Baku and definitely worth going to. Firstly, it houses a stunning collection of 20th century avant-garde art"

        "wiki": "The Full Frequency Tour is concert tour by Jamaican recording artist, Sean Paul. The tour supports his sixth studio album, Full Frequency (2014). The rapper played over 30 shows primarily in Europe, with additional shows in Asia, North America, Africa and Australasia. \n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nSenior music writer George Palathingal of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the concert in Sydney four stars. He expressed: \n\"We have to start with some brutal truth. Early 2000s luminaries Sean Paul and his current touring partner M\u00fda haven't exactly troubled the mainstream in recent years\u2014certainly not in Australia; minimally, even, in the urban-music-loving US.\" However he noted, \"Nonetheless, on this night, both not only prove to have a sizeable, dedicated following, they still perform as though they're at the peak of their careers.\"Speaking on behalf of M\u00fda\u2019s set, Palathingal wrote, \"M\u00fda is all class. She soulfully sings, dances and, over a couple of costume changes, even dresses like the (ghetto) superstar she only almost became when she was cavorting around in her smalls with Pink, Christina Aguilera and Lil' Kim as the least-impressive name on the 2001 \"Lady Marmalade\" cover.\" Writing on behalf of Paul\u2019s performance, he said, \"Here, however, the mohawked Paul and his thunderous backing band play an unselfish set loaded with sizzling, pounding takes on the early likes of \"Get Busy\", \"Give It Up to Me\", \"Like Glue\" and \"Temperature\", rather than constantly force recent material down your throat, and the results are irresistible.\"Concluding in his review, \"And if there's one lesson we can learn from this night it's that even if we might question his choices on record, live, Sean Paul still definitely knows what he's doing.\"The Gleaner gave the concert a positive review as well and wrote, \"A scintillating set, complete with full band, DJ, supporting vocals and dancers, Sean Paul electrified the hall for well over an hour and well past curfew. Yet, the audience rocked, danced and screamed as each hit was followed by another hit.\"\n\n\n== Opening acts ==\nFii (Germany)\nDie Boys (Germany)\nM\u00fda (Australia)\nYoung Men Society (Sydney)\nLazy J (Sydney)\n\n\n== Setlist ==\nThis setlist was obtained from the concert held on May 10, 2014, at the Rockhal in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. It does not represent all concerts for the duration of the tour.\n\"Want Dem All\"\n\"So Fine\"\n\"Get Busy\"\n\"Give It Up to Me\"\n\"Got 2 Luv U\"\n\"How Deep Is Your Love\"\n\"Hey Baby\"\n\"Baby Boy\" / \"Break It Off\"\n\"Like Glue\"\n\"Gimme the Light\"\n\"We Be Burnin'\"\n\"Hold On\"\n\"Other Side of Love\"\n\"I'm Still in Love with You\"\n\"Punkie\"\n\"Hold My Hand\"\n\"Body\"\n\"She Doesn't Mind\"\n\"Temperature\"\n\"Turn It Up\"\n\n\n== Tour dates ==\nFestivals and other miscellaneous performances\nA This concert was a part of the \"Opening Party\"\nB This concert was a part of \"Summer Up\"\nC This concert was a part of the \"Wireless Festival\"\nD This concert was a part of the \"Reggae Sumfest\"\nE This concert was a part of \"Festivent Ville de L\u00e9vis\"\nF This concert was a part of \"Heitere Open Air\"\nG This concert was a part of \"Dreamland\"\nH This concert was a part of \"Lokerse Feesten\"\nI This concert was a part of the \"Montreal International Reggae Festival\"\nJ This concert was a part of \"Rototom Sunsplash\"Cancellations and rescheduled shows\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Baku Boulevard (Azerbaijani: D\u0259nizk\u0259nar\u0131 Milli Park, also known as National Park) is a promenade established in 1909  which runs parallel to Baku's seafront. Its history goes back more than 100 years, to a time when Baku oil barons built their mansions along the Caspian shore and when the seafront was artificially built up inch by inch.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe park stretches along a south-facing bay on the Caspian Sea. It traditionally starts at Freedom Square continuing west to the Old City and beyond. Since 2012, the Yeni Bulvar (new boulevard) has virtually doubled the length to 3.75 km, extending the promenades to National Flag Square. In 2015 White City Boulevard added a further 2 km to the east of Freedom Square and reports have suggested that eventually the boulevard might be as long as 26 km, including Bibiheyb\u0259t.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Imperial Russian and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic Eras ===\n\nThe boulevard was established to connect the oilfields in Bibi Heybet as part of the urban development projects by Municipal Horticultural Commission.In 1900, the Municipal Horticultural Commission decided to plant trees and shrubs along the seafront. Kazimierz Skurewicz, a Polish engineer, designed a 20-meter-wide embankment, using vegetation that would survive Baku's extremely hot, dry and gusty climate.\nIn 1909, Mammad Hassan Hajinski, Head of Baku's Municipal Construction Department improved the park by spending 60,000 rubles after Duma passed his resolution. The park was intended to provide for the continued expansion of the city to the north, providing relaxation and recreation opportunities for the new middle class to the west, and an escape from the rapid slumming of the city centre for those left behind. To select the best design for the Boulevard, Hajinski organized a contest among the architects in Baku. However, since most of the city's 30 architects were busy designing mansions for oil barons, only three submitted plans for it. The winning design was titled \"Zvezda\" (Star) and featured a bathing house, luxurious restaurant and a dozen pavilions. The design specified that wastewater would be collected in a separate manifold instead of being discharged directly into the Caspian (which is the case today). Work was completed in 1911.\nUntil the early 20th century, the avenue had mansions on one side and seafront on the other. There were no trees. Tons and tons of fertile soil were imported to enrich the soil quality. Baku's Mayor, R. R. Hoven, supported by the richest industrialists, passed a decree in the 1880s saying that all ships entering Baku harbors from Iran had to bring fertile soil with them. In reality, this was a kind of \"tax\" or \"duty\" imposed for the right to use the harbor and load up with oil. Within a very short time, enough soil was deposited, and the parks that characterize the city's seafront today were developed.\nAt the new Baku Bathing House, visitors could take a swim while visiting the Boulevard. This bathing house was closed in the late 1950s due to poor maintenance and the bay's polluted water.\nThe improved Boulevard stretched from what is now the SOCAR Circle to the luxurious cinema, restaurant and the casino that was called \"Phenomenon\", designed by Polish architect J\u00f3zef Plo\u015bko in 1912.\n\n\n=== Soviet Period ===\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the casino was converted to a Puppet Theater, a function it still serves today. Subsequently, the Boulevard was extended up to the Baku International Sea Trade Port. \nIn 1936, a Parachute tower was built and used for extreme activities. However, the tower stopped functioning after a fatal accident in the 1960s, which led to the ultimate ban of parachuting from the tower. To this day, the tower is considered one of the landmarks of the boulevard.The Boulevard developed further after the construction of Bahar and Mirvari cafes, summer cinema and other leisure attractions during 1950-1960s.In 1970, the boulevard was expanded to both eastward and westward.In the 1980s, the area was mismanaged and maintenance was neglected. The situation further deteriorated as the level of the sea began to rise so high that many of the trees and shrubs in the park started dying off due to the salinity of the water. At present, once again, the Caspian sea level is going back down.\n\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nIn 1999, the boulevard was proclaimed a National Park by Heydar Aliyev, former president of Azerbaijan. This status also helped to mitigate the environmental concerns such as cleanup of oil pollution from Caspian Sea oilfields. Until 2009, there were 28 entertainment attractions in boulevard's amusement park. However, due to safety reasons, old attractions were replaced by new carousels and rides from Italy and Germany.In 2008 the Parachute Tower was reconstructed and started to display wind speed, time, date, air and sea water temperature.The boulevard contains an amusement park, yacht club and musical fountain, and various statues and monuments. The park is popular with dog-walkers and joggers, and is convenient for tourists, being adjacent to newly built International Center of Mugham and musical fountain.\nThe boulevard marked it is 100th anniversary in 2009 as the specific date of it is creation is still unknown.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nIn 2010, a multi-story shopping mall Park Bulvar, Baku Business Centre and 5D cinema were opened in this promenade as part of Government's regeneration policy to boost shopping and leisure in Baku.In 2012, after Azerbaijan's victory in Eurovision Song Contest 2011, the boulevard extended towards Bayil settlement, where National Flag Square unveiled. Confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records, the flag flies on a pole 162 meters high and measures 70 by 35 meters which makes it the world's highest flag.

        "wiki": "Gobustan State Reserve located west of the settlement of Gobustan, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of the centre of Baku was established in 1966 when the region was declared as a national historical landmark of Azerbaijan in an attempt to preserve the ancient carvings, mud volcanoes and gas-stones in the region.\nGobustan State Reserve is very rich in archeological monuments, the reserve has more than 6,000 rock carvings, which depict people, animals, battle-pieces, ritual dances, bullfights, boats with armed oarsmen, warriors with lances in their hands, camel caravans, pictures of sun and stars, on the average dating back to 5,000-20,000 years.\nGobustan State Historical and Cultural Reserve acquired national status in 2006. As a part of the 31st Session of the UNESCO World Legacy Committee held in Christchurch, New Zealand on June 23 - July 2, 2007 included within the World Social Legacy List.\n\n\n== Prehistoric carvings ==\nThe rock carvings and petroglyphs at the site display mesmerizing images of prehistoric life in the Caucasus. The well-preserved sketches display ancient populations travelling on reed boats; men hunting antelope and wild bulls, and women dancing.  The famed Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl returned many times to Azerbaijan between 1961 and his death in 2002 to study the site in his \"Search for Odin\".\nThe language of the ancient population of Gobustan is disputed, but the petroglyphs still give information about the lives of prehistoric people who lived there. More than 4,000 pictures of animals, humans, natural life experiences, hunting, and dancing were carved over a span of thousands of years. Most of the petroglyphs are on large cliffs, divided among multiple ancient residences, and in some cases they have been carved over older images. The first carvings depicted natural human and animal figures, often irregularly, but over time they began to more closely resemble the measurements and proportions of their subjects, including such details as the foot muscles of people in hunting scenes. The heads of the human figures tend to be small and carved without noses, mouths, eyes, or ears. However, experts do not interpret this lack of facial features as an indication that the Gobustan artists lacked technical skill, since some of the carvings demonstrate a higher degree of complexity and detail. Many scenes from tribal life are depicted among the petroglyphs, and images from the Seven Beauties cave suggest that women may have participated in hunting. \n\n\n== Mud volcanoes ==\nIt's estimated that 300 of the planet's estimated 700 mud volcanoes sit in Gobustan, Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. Many geologists as well as locals and international mud tourists trek to such places as the Firuz Crater, Gobustan, Salyan and end up happily covered in mud which is thought to have medicinal qualities.[1]\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe nature of Gobustan is much more suitable than other regions of Azerbaijan. However, the natural conditions of these places were completely different in 20-25 thousand years ago. From the drawings of animals and human figures on the Gobustan, rocks seem to have been under warm climate from 10 to 12 thousand years. People were wearing gentle clothes, men tightened their paws, and women were wearing short leather dresses. Because of the permanent hot weather, greenery and abundant water, these places were the habitats of wild animals: bulls, horses, deer, goats, and other animals lived in Gobustan. From the rock drawings and the archeological findings, wolves, tigers, foxes, jackals and other wild animals have been found in this place in ancient times. In 1968 while cutting off 3 metres (9.8 ft) depth stone layer near Atbulakh, accidentally the large bones of an unknown animal were cut off. The workers informed the Ministry of Culture of the Azerbaijan SSR, not knowing what those bones were. After the investigation of the discovered bones, it was determined that these bones were the VI bone of the neck of the southern elephant, which lived in Gobustan. \n\n\n== Gaval Dash ==\nThe Gaval Dash is a natural musical stone which can only be found in Gobustan, Azerbaijan. Among the stone books there are a big flat stone formed out of 3 supports. Suffice it to touch the object with a small stone, musical sounds come from it. The stone is called Gaval Dash, the sound can be compared with a tambourine. The Gaval Dash have been formed due to the combination of unique climate, oil and gas which can be found in the region of Azerbaijan.

        "wiki": "The Baku Ateshgah (from Persian: \u0622\u062a\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647\u200e, \u0100tashg\u0101h, Azerbaijani: At\u0259\u015fgah), often called the \"Fire Temple of Baku\" is a castle-like religious temple in Surakhani town (in Suraxan\u0131 raion), a suburb in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nBased on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu, and Zoroastrian place of worship. \"\u0100tash\" (\u0622\u062a\u0634) is the Persian word for fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetrapillar-altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural eternal flame went out in 1969, after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.The Baku Ateshgah was a pilgrimage and philosophical centre of Zoroastrians from Northwestern Indian subcontinent, who were involved in trade with the Caspian area via the famous \"Grand Trunk Road\". The four holy elements of their belief were: ateshi (fire), badi (air), abi (water), and heki (earth). The temple ceased to be a place of worship after 1883 with the installation of petroleum plants (industry) at Surakhany. The complex was turned into a museum in 1975. The annual number of visitors to the museum is 15,000.The Temple of Fire \"Ateshgah\" was nominated for List of World Heritage Sites,  UNESCO in 1998 by Gulnara Mehmandarova. On December 19, 2007, it was declared a state historical-architectural reserve by decree of the President of Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Persian toponym Atashgah (with Russian/Azerbaijani pronunciation: Atashgyakh/Ateshgah) literally means \"home of fire.\" The Persian-origin term atesh (\u0622\u062a\u0634) means \"fire\", and is a loanword in Azerbaijani; it is etymologically related to the Vedic \u0905\u0925\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d atharvan. Gah (\u06af\u0627\u06c1) derives from Middle Persian and means \"throne\" or \"bed\" and it is identical with Sanskrit g\u1e5bha \u0917\u0943\u0939 for \"house\", which in popular usage becomes gah. The name refers to the fact that the site is situated atop a now-exhausted natural gas field, which once caused natural fires to spontaneously burn there as the gas emerged from seven natural surface vents. Today, the fires in the complex are fed by gas piped in from Baku, and are only turned on for the benefit of visitors.\nSurakhani, the name of the town where the Ateshgah is located, likely means \"a region of holes\" (\u0633\u0631\u0627\u062e/suraakh is Persian for \"hole\"), but might perhaps be a reference to the fire glow as well (\u0633\u0631\u062e/sorkh/surkh is Persian for \"red\"). A historic alternative name for Azerbaijan as a whole has been Odlar Yurdu, Azeri for \"land of fires\". The etymology in Sanskrit for Surakhani is \"mine of the gods\" from sura which stands for the \"gods\", who stand in opposition to the asuras, the demons.\nSurakhany in Tati (the language of Surakhany, close to Persian) means \u201chole with the fountain\u201d.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSurakhani is located on the Absheron peninsula, which is famous for being a locality where oil oozes naturally from the ground and flames burn perpetually \u2014 as at Yanar Dag \u2014 fed by natural hydrocarbon vapours issuing from the rock.In the 7th century the Armenian geography Ashkharatsuyts, attributed to Anania Shirakatsi, a location called Yotnporakyan Bagink (\u201cPlace with seven worshiped holes\u201d) is mentioned in the Paytakaran province, which is thought to be the Ateshgah. The 8th-century Armenian historian Ghevond, describing a Khazar invasion of Caucasian Albania in 730 AD, mentioned the area \"Atshi-Baguan\u201d. Sarah Ashurbeyli notes that the Atsh is distorted Atesh (\u201cfire\u201d) and Atshi-Baguan means \u201cFires of Baguan\u201d, referring to Baku. The word Baguan comes from the word Baga, which means \u201cGod\u201d in Old Persian, and Bhaga, \u092d\u0917, also means \"God\" in Sanskrit.\n\"Seven holes with eternal fires\" were mentioned by German traveler Engelbert Kaempfer, who visited Surakhani in 1683.Estakhri (10th century) mentioned that not far from Baku (i.e., on the Apsheron Peninsula) lived fire worshippers. This was confirmed by Movses Daskhurantsi in his reference of the province of Bhagavan (\u201cFields of the Gods\u201d i.e., \u201cFire Gods\u201d).In the 18th century, Atashgah was visited by Zoroastrians.

Bovan (modern Bovanat) is the village near Esfahan. The word Badak is a diminutive of Bad-Kubeh. (The name of Baku in the sources of the 17th and 18th centuries was Bad-e Kube). At the end of the reference is the constellation of Sombole /Virgo (August\u2013September). In the name of the month the master mistakenly shifted the \u201cl\u201d and \u201ch\u201d at the end of the word. According to Zoroastrian calendar Qadimi New Year in 1745 AD was in August.\nInteresting information about Zoroastrianism in Baku is given by D. Shapiro in A Karaite from Wolhynia meets a Zoroastrian from Baku. Avraham Firkowicz, a Karaite collector of ancient manuscripts, wrote about his meeting in Darband in 1840 with a fire-worshipper from Baku. Firkowicz asked him \u201cWhy do you worship fire?\u201d The fire-worshipper replied that he worshipped not fire, but the Creator symbolised by fire - a \u201cmatter\u201d or abstraction (and hence not a person) called Q\u2019r\u0163\u2019 . Pahlavi Q\u2019r\u0163\u2019  (from Avestan kirdar or Sanskrit k\u1e5bt and \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e) signifies  \u201cone who does\u201d or \u201ccreator\u201d.\nAccording to the famed Parsi Dastur J.J.Modi, who investigated the shrine: \"\"I became convinced that this place has nothing to do with Parsees. It is not a Parsee Atash Kadeh but a Hindu Temple.\"\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nSome scholars have speculated that the Ateshgah may have been an ancient Zoroastrian shrine that was decimated by invading Islamic armies during the Muslim conquest of Persia and its neighboring regions. It has also been asserted that, \"according to historical sources, before the construction of the Indian Temple of Fire (Atashgah) in Surakhani at the end of the 17th century, the local people also worshipped at this site because of the 'seven holes with burning flame'.\"Fire is considered sacred in Hinduism and Zoroastrianism (as Agni and Atar respectively), and there has been debate on whether the Atashgah was originally a Hindu structure, or a Zoroastrian one. The trident mounted atop the structure is usually a distinctly Hindu sacred symbol (as the Trishula, which is commonly mounted on temples) and has been cited by Zoroastrian scholars as a specific reason for considering the Atashgah as a Hindu site. However, an Azeri presentation on the history of Baku, which calls the shrine a \"Hindu temple\", identifies the trident as a Zoroastrian symbol of \"good thoughts, good words and good deeds\".even though the trident symbol is not associated with Zoroastrianism\nOne early European commentator, Jonas Hanway, bucketed Zoroastrians, Sikhs, and Hindus together with respect to their religious beliefs: \"These opinions, with a few alterations, are still maintained by some of the posterity of the ancient Indians and Persians, who are called Gebers or Gaurs, and are very zealous in preserving the religion of their ancestors; particularly in regard to their veneration for the element of fire.\" Geber is a Persian term for Zoroastrians, while Gaurs are a priestly Hindu caste. A later scholar, A. V. Williams Jackson, drew a distinction between the two groups. While stating that \"the typical features which Hanway mentions are distinctly Indian, not Zoroastrian\" based on the worshipers' attires and tilakas, their strictly vegetarian diets and open veneration for cows, he left open the possibility that a few \"actual Gabrs (i.e. Zoroastrians, or Parsis)\" may also have been present at the shrine alongside larger Hindu and Sikh groups.\n\n\n=== Indian local residents and pilgrims ===\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, there were significant Indian communities throughout Central Asia. In Baku, Indian merchants from the Multan region of Punjab controlled much of the commercial economy, along with the Armenians. Much of the woodwork for ships on the Caspian was also done by Indian craftsmen. Some commentators have theorized that Baku's Indian community may have been responsible for the construction or renovation of the Ateshgah.As European academics and explorers began arriving in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, they documented encounters with dozens of Hindus at the shrine as well as Sikh pilgrims en route in the regions between North India and Baku.Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin's Reise durch Russland (1771) is cited in Karl Eduard von Eichwald's Reise in den Caucasus (Stuttgart, 1834) where the naturalist Gmelin is said to have observed Yogi austerities being performed by devotees. Geologist Eichwald restricts himself to a mention of the worship of Rama, Krishna, Hanuman and Agni. In the 1784 account of George Forster of the Bengal Civil Service, the square structure was about 30 yards across, surrounded by a low wall and containing many apartments. Each of these had a small jet of sulphurous fire issuing from a funnel \"constructed in the shape of a Hindu altar.\" The fire was used for worship, cooking and warmth, and would be regularly extinguished.\"The Ateshgyakh Temple looks not unlike a regular town caravansary - a kind of inn with a large central court, where caravans stopped for the night. As distinct from caravansaries, however, the temple has the altar in its center with tiny cells for the temple's attendants - Indian ascetics who devoted themselves to the cult of fire - and for pilgrims lining the walls.\"\n\n\n=== Zoroastrian local residents and pilgrims ===\n\nThere are some data that in addition to the Hindus in the temple were present Zoroastrians (Parsis and Guebres) and Sikhs.\nChardin in the 17th century reported about Persian Guebres, which worshiped forever burning fire that was in two days' journey from Shemakha (on the Apsheron).Engelbert Kaempfer, who visited Surakhany in 1683, wrote that among people who worshiped fire, two men are descendants of Persians who migrated to India.French Jesuit Villotte, who lived in Azerbaijan since 1689, reports that Ateshgah revered by Hindus, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians, the descendants of the ancient Persians.German traveler Lerch who visited the temple in 1733, wrote that here there are 12 Guebres or ancient Persian fire worshipers\u00bb.J. Hanway visited Baku in 1747 and left few records of Ateshgah. People, who worshiped fire in Ateshgah he calls \"Indians\", \"Persians\" and \u201cGuebres\u201d.S. Gmelin, who visited Ateshgah in 1770, wrote that in the present Ateshgah lived Indians and descendants of the ancient Guebres.In 1820 the French consul Gamba visits the temple. According to Gamba here lived Hindus, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians, the followers of Zoroaster.The Englishman Ussher visited Ateshgah in September 19, 1863 He calls it \"Atash Jah\" and said that there are pilgrims from India and Persia \nGerman Baron Max Thielmann visited the temple in October 1872 and in his memoirs he wrote that Parsi community of Bombay sent here a priest who after a few years will be replaced. His presence is necessary, because here come the pilgrims from the outskirts of Persia (Yazd, Kerman) and from India and remain in this sacred place for several months or years.In 1876 English traveler James Bruce visited Ateshgah. He noted that the Bombay Parsi Punchayat provides a permanent presence in the temple of their priest. Pierre Ponafidine visited the temple at the same time and mentioned about two priests from Bombay.\nE. Orsolle, who visited the temple after Bruce, said that after Parsi priest died in 1864, the Parsi Punchayat of Bombay a few years later sent another priest here, but the pilgrims who came here from India and Iran have already forgotten the sanctuary, and in 1880 there was nobody.\nO'Donovan visited the temple in 1879 and refers about religious worship of Guebres.In 1898 in the \u00abMen and Women of India\u00bb magazine was published an article entitled \"The ancient Zoroastrian temple in Baku. Author calls Ateshgah as \"Parsi temple,\" and notes that the last Zoroastrian priest was sent there for about 30 years ago (that is, in the 1860s.).\nJ. Henry in 1905, in his book also noted that 25 years ago (i.e. about in 1880) in Surakhani died last Parsi priest.The Parsi Dastur J.J. Modi who visited the site in 1925 was emphatic that it was not a Zoroastrian temple because of its design and other considerations. He believed it was a Hindu temple.\n\n\n=== Inscriptions and likely period of construction ===\n\nThere are several inscriptions on the Ateshgah. They are all in either Sanskrit or Punjabi, with the exception of one Persian inscription that occurs below an accompanying Sanskrit invocation to Lord Ganesha and Jwala Ji. Although the Persian inscription contains grammatical errors, both the inscriptions contain the same year date of 1745 Common Era (Samvat/\u0938\u0902\u0935\u0924 1802/\u0967\u096e\u0966\u0968 and Hijri 1158/\u0661\u0661\u0665\u0668). Taken as a set, the dates on the inscriptions range from Samvat 1725 to Samvat 1873, which corresponds to the period from 1668 CE to 1816 CE. This, coupled with the assessment that the structure looks relatively new, has led some scholars to postulate the 17th century as its likely period of construction. One press report asserts that local records exist that state that the structure was built by the Baku Hindu traders community around the time of the fall of the Shirvanshah dynasty and annexation by the Russian Empire following the Russo-Persian War (1722\u20131723).The inscriptions in the temple in Sanskrit (in Nagari Devanagari script) and Punjabi (in Gurmukhi script) identify the site as a place of Hindu and Sikh worship, and state it was built and consecrated for Jwala Ji, the modern Hindu fire deity. Jwala (\u091c\u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e/\u091c\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e) means flame in Sanskrit (c.f. Indo-European cognates: proto-Indo-European guelh, English: glow, Lithuanian: zvilti) and Ji is an honorific used in the Indian subcontinent. There is a famed shrine to Jwala Ji in the Himalayas, in the settlement of Jawalamukhi, in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India to which the Atashgah bears strong resemblance and on which some scholars (such as A. V. Williams Jackson) suggested the current structure may have been modeled. However, other scholars have stated that some Jwala Ji devotees used to refer to the Kangra shrine as the 'smaller Jwala Ji' and the Baku shrine as the 'greater Jwala Ji'. Other deities mentioned in the inscriptions include Ganesha and Shiva. The Punjabi language inscriptions are quotations from the Adi Granth, while some of the Sanskrit ones are drawn from the Sat Sri Ganesaya namah text.\n\n\n=== Examination by Zoroastrian priests ===\n\nIn 1876, James Bryce visited the region and found that \"the most remarkable mineral product is naphtha, which bursts forth in many places, but most profusely near Baku, on the coast of the Caspian, in strong springs, some of which are said to always be burning.\" Without referencing the Atashgah by name, he mentioned of the Zoroastrians that \"after they were extirpated from Persia by the Mohammedans, who hate them bitterly, some few occasionally slunk here on pilgrimage\" and that \"under the more tolerant sway of the Czar, a solitary priest of fire is maintained by the Parsee community of Bombay, who inhabits a small temple built over one of the springs\".The temple was examined in the late 19th and early 20th century by Parsi dasturs, some of whom had also visited the Jwala Ji at Kangra in the Himalayas. Based on the inscriptions and the structure, their assessment was that the temple was a Hindu and Sikh shrine. In 1925, a Zoroastrian priest and academic Jivanji Jamshedji Modi traveled to Baku to determine if the temple had indeed been once a Zoroastrian place of worship. Until then (and again today), the site was visited by Zoroastrian pilgrims from India. In his Travels Outside Bombay, Modi observed that \"not just me but any Parsee who is a little familiar with our Hindu or Sikh brethren's religion, their temples and their customs, after examining this building with its inscriptions, architecture, etc., would conclude that this is not a [Zoroastrian] Atash Kadeh but is a Hindu Temple whose Brahmins (priests) used to worship fire (Sanskrit: Agni).\"Besides the physical evidence indicating that the complex was a Hindu place of worship, the existing structural features are not consistent with those for any other Zoroastrian or Sikh places of worship (for instance, cells for ascetics, fireplace open to all sides, ossuary pit and no water source. It cannot be ruled out that the site may once have been a Zoroastrian place of worship. As a Hindu temple it is taken to belong to one of four major fire Jwala Ji temples.\nJ. Unvala visited temple in 1935 and noted that its structure is pure Sasanian style.\n\n\n=== Exhaustion of the natural gas ===\n\nThe fire was once fed by a vent from a subterranean natural gas field located directly beneath the complex, but heavy exploitation of the natural gas reserves in the area during Soviet rule resulted in the flame going out in 1969. Today, the museum's fire is fed by mains gas piped in from Baku city.\n\n\n=== Claimed visit by Czar Alexander III ===\n\nThere were local claims made to a visiting Zoroastrian dastur in 1925 that the Russian czar Alexander III who was in Baku in 1888witnessed Hindu fire prayer rituals at this location. However, the latter claim had not been verified.\n\n\n== Public recognition ==\n\nAn illustration of the Baku Fire Temple was included on two denominations of Azerbaijan's first issue of postage stamps, released in 1919. Five oil derricks appear in the background.By a presidential order issued in December 2007, the shrine complex, which had hitherto been officially associated with the \"Shirvanshah Palace Complex State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve\" (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u044f-\u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0430 \u0428\u0438\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0448\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u00bb) was declared as a distinct reserve by the Azeri government (the \"Ateshgah Temple State Historical Architectural Reserve, \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u00ab\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0410\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0433\u044f\u0445\u00bb).In July 2009, the Azeri President, Ilham Aliyev, announced a grant of AZN 1 million for the upkeep of the shrine.In April 2018, the former External Affairs Minister of India, Sushma Swaraj, visited and paid her respects to the shrine.[3]\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nQobustan, Baku\nYanar Dag\nZoroastrianism in Azerbaijan\nHinduism in Azerbaijan\nSikhism in Azerbaijan\nList of World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links and photographs ==\nIndian Inscriptions on the Fire Temple at B\u0101ku (1908)\n\u201cAt\u0259\u015fgah m\u0259b\u0259di\u201d - official web-site of museum fire temple Atashgah (in Azeri)\nSanskrit invocation to Lord Shiva in an Atashgah inscription, with the Hindu devotional-form of the Swastika on top\nPunjabi inscription on the Atashgah beginning with Ik Onkar Satnam\"\nThe cremation pit on the Atashgah premises",

          "This is a fabulous place, but as a fire temple it is probably more magic after sunset. But the museum alone is worth a visit, and by far the most interesting tourist trap I have seen in the country.",
          "First visited this interesting site over 20 years ago when it seemed miles from Baku city and was in slight disrepair but felt and seemed very original, re-visited this summer to find that it had been refurbished a little too much, looked brand new and far to clean in terms of",

          "Azerbaijan is the land of fire and has been for millennia, so the Fire Temple at Surakhania was an important item on my wish-list. As with pretty well every other place of interest that the average tourist may wish to visit, the locals clam up about it. No one in Baku knew which",
          "Wonderful to see how the Zorastrian heritage has been preserved, fascinating look at an ancient site",
          "Not too far from Baku (about one and half hours slow drive) the Fire Temple is normally scheduled also to visit the land of fire. Roads are good and the Temple is worth the visit, although it is a rather small place to visit - one hour is enough for this visit.",

          "Although this is a modern replica of what the temple would have been like, and the buildings, therefore, aren't real, you can learn a lot about the Zoastrian religion and culture by observing the exhibits. A bookstore has a good English language book which will provide a good",

          "This place was more than a museum or historic site, it was a holy place still in active use by visiting Zoroastrians (Parsees). It made a strong impression on me. The visit was greatly enhanced by an excellent, scholarly guide on site who spoke English well. The various rooms of",

          "I found this really interesting (it is worth to have a guide or a guidebook reading) and the empty spaces, the fire...it all contributes to a mystery vibe... Went there as part of a full day trip throughout the peninsula and understand why some reviews mention it is not worth to",

        "wiki": "Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum (Azerbaijani: Az\u0259rbaycan Milli Xal\u00e7a Muzeyi, formerly called the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum) is a museum located in Baku that displays Azerbaijani carpets and rugs of various weaving techniques and materials from various periods. It has the largest collection of Azerbaijani carpets in the world.\nIt moved to a new building on the Baku's seafront park during 2014 from its former location on Neftchiler Avenue.Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum was established in accordance with the decree No. 130 of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR dated March 13, 1967. From 1967 to 1993, the museum was called the Azerbaijan State Museum of Carpet and Folk Applied Arts, from 1993 to 2014 \u2013 State Museum of Carpet and Applied Arts named after Latif Karimov, from 2014 to 2019 \u2013 Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, and from 2019 to the present \u2013 Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum was established in 1967 and was initially located in the Juma Mosque in Icheri Sheher. The mosque was built in the 15th century and renovated in the 19th century. Its first exhibition was held in 1972. In 1992, after the collapse of USSR, the museum was moved to the second floor of what is now the Baku Museum Center, a building that had originally been the Lenin museum. The collection was named in honour of the carpet designer Latif Karimov.\nPlans to move the collection to a new purpose-built venue have been in the works since 2010 when Azerbaijani carpets were proclaimed \"a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage\" by UNESCO.\nThe new building was due to open in late 2012 and was visited by President Ilham Aliyev in September 2013. The museum opened on 26 August 2014. In April 2014 the museum was renamed the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, dropping its much longer official title.Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum was established in accordance with the decree No. 130 of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR dated March 13, 1967. From 1967 to 1993, the museum was called the Azerbaijan State Museum of Carpet and Folk Applied Arts, from 1993 to 2014 \u2013 State Museum of Carpet and Applied Arts named after Latif Karimov, from 2014 to 2019 \u2013 Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, and from 2019 to the present \u2013 Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum.\nAt the time of establishing, it was the only museum that was dedicated to the art of carpet weaving. The main purpose of the museum's creation was to store, research, and demonstrate unique examples of the carpet weaving art, which are Azerbaijan's national heritage. The initiator of the museum was Latif Karimov, the outstanding scientist and carpet weaver, founder of the science of Azerbaijan Carpet Art, artist and teacher, author of the fundamental work Azerbaijani Carpet.\nThe first permanent exhibition was presented on April 26, 1972, in the building of the Juma Mosque, an architectural monument of the 19th century, located in Icherisheher (Old City). The national leader of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, who provided great support to the museum from the first days of its establishment, took part at the opening ceremony. In 1970\u20131980s, with the constant help of the country's leadership in the person of Heydar Aliyev, Museum had regular opportunities to purchase crafts and thereby replenish its collections. In those years, masterpieces of Azerbaijani Carpet Weaving Art were purchased for the museum.\nIn 1992, the State Museum of Carpet and Applied Arts was moved to the Museum Center (former Lenin Museum), located at the Neftchilar Avenue. In 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to the presidential decree, the building was given to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Azerbaijan and renamed to Museum Center. The museum exhibition, representing the carpet samples from different regions of Azerbaijan, as well as works of other kinds of applied arts, was located in thirteen spacious rooms on the second floor.\nIn 2007, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed a decree for the creation of a new building for the museum in the territory of Seaside National Park within the framework of a joint project of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and UNESCO. In 2014, under the direction of Austrian architect Franz Janz, the museum building, which meets all modern requirements, was completed. Over the years, the museum is continuously developed and has become one of the main storage of samples of the Azerbaijan national culture.\nThroughout its fifty years, the museum was led by several directors. From 1967 to 1982, it was led by Aziz Aliyev, Honored Art Worker; from 1982 to January 5, 2016 \u2013 by Professor Roya Tagiyeva, Honored Cultural Worker, Doctor in Arts. Since March 2, 2016, the museum has been headed by Dr. Shirin Melikova, Honored Cultural Worker.\nThe museum has become a research, training, cultural and educational center where many events, such as exhibitions, international symposiums, and conferences, are held. During its fifty years of existence, the museum has organized more than thirty exhibitions in different countries throughout the world. In 1983, on the initiative of Heydar Aliyev and the organizational support of UNESCO, the international symposium Art of Oriental Carpets was held in the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum. Later, international symposiums such as Azerbaijan Carpet Weaving Art (1988), and Azerbaijan Carpet and Applied Arts (2003) were held within the participation of the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum. Additionally, in 2007, a symposium dedicated to Latif Karimov's centenary was held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris.\nThe museum cooperates closely with influential international organizations, such as the European Textile Network (ETN), the European Museum Forum (EMF), the International Council of Museums (ICOM), UNESCO, and the Council for Humanitarian Cooperation of the Member States of the CIS (IFESCO).\nIn 2004, a law On the Preservation and Development of Azerbaijani Carpet was prepared and adopted within the museum's participation. This law was aimed to implement the registration of Azerbaijani carpets, protect and support their development, and coordinate scientific and methodical training.\nIn 2010, the Traditional Azerbaijan Carpet Weaving Art was included within the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on the initiative of Mehriban Aliyeva, First Vice-President of Azerbaijan, President of Heydar Aliyev Foundation, member of Milli Majlis (National Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan), and Goodwill Ambassador of UNESCO and ISESCO.\nAzerbaijan Carpet Museum in accordance with the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated July 15, 2019, received the National status for its significant contribution in popularization and promotion of the Azerbaijani Carpet Weaving Art.\nToday, Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, which is located in one of the country's most modern buildings, not only stores a rich collection of artifacts and carpets (our nation's most valuable heritage), but also operates as the site for the comprehensive research of traditional carpet weaving art and its popularization within the world culture.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe structure of the building is intended to look like a rolled carpet. Designed by Austrian architect Franz Janz, the building took over six years to construct. The previous structure, a building of historical significance, was destroyed to make way for the new building.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe collection of the museum includes over 10,000 items of ceramics, metal works of the 14th century, jewellery from the Bronze Age, carpets and carpet items from the 17th-20th centuries, national garments and embroidery, and applied art works of the Modern Age. \nThe museum organizes public lectures and study courses on carpets and applied arts. It has a book store selling books on Azerbaijani crafts and carpet art. The museum also holds a permanent collection from the Shusha Museum of History, from the city of Shusha, which was looted after occupation by Armenian troops in 1992. Some of the exhibited items of the Shusha museum were saved when the director of the museum moved out 600 carpets before occupation. They are now displayed at the museum in an exhibition titled \"Burned Culture\".\n\n\n== International exhibitions ==\nThe museum does research and public service work. Every year, state and international exhibitions are organized and catalogues on carpets are printed by the museum. The museum has also held exhibitions in more than 30 countries including France, Germany, England, Japan, the Netherlands. In 1998, the museum participated in a UNESCO-organized exhibition in Paris dedicated to Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee and in 1999 dedicated to the 1,300th anniversary of the Book of Dede Korkut and displayed carpets, folk applied art items, including copper jugs, mugs, buckets and saddle-bags.\n\n\n== Admissions & Ticketing ==\n\n\n=== Working time ===\nWeekdays: Tuesday-Friday \u2013 10 am.- 6 pm.\nWeekends: Saturday-Sunday \u2013 10 am.- 8 pm.\nDay off is Monday.\n\n\n=== Entrance fee ===\nTicket for adults is 7 AZN, for pupils and students is 3 AZN.\nTicket for children under 6 years is free.\n\n\n=== Address ===\nBaku, Mikay\u0131l Huseynov av., 28\n(+994) 12-497-20-57 \n\n\n== See also ==\nAzerbaijan State Museum of Art\nAzerbaijan State Museum of History\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Azerbaijani, English, and Russian)\nAzerbaijan Carpet Museum at Google Cultural Institute\nAzerbaijani Carpets\nCarpet Weaving in Azerbaijan",

        "wiki": "Baku zoo (Azerbaijani: Bak\u0131 zooloji park\u0131) is a state zoological park in Baku. It is the oldest zoo in Azerbaijan and was opened in 1928. It belongs to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan and to the Mayoralty of Baku city. The total area of the zoo is 4.25 hectares (10.5 acres).\n\n\n== History ==\nBaku zoo was opened in 1928, in the territory of a park named after Lunacharsky (today this park is named after Nizami).\nIn 1942, a new zoo was founded on the basis of evacuated Rostov zoo, the opening ceremony of which was held after the Great Patriotic War. Until 1958, the zoological park was located near a railway station in a small square, which was later named after Ilich.\n\nIn 1958, the zoo was relocated to Bayil township, on the outskirts of Baku and remained there until the middle of 1970s, when a Bayil landslide happened, during which a lion and a bear died crushed in a fallen cage. This event made the city power to think about a new, safe place for the zoo, but until the decision was made, the zoo was temporarily relocated to Razin township (at present Bakikhanov township), where it was located until 1985.But during this period of time an expert group of zoologists, biologists and other specialists decided that a park located in the territory of Narimanov rayon of Baku was the appropriate place for habitation of animals. Construction of the new zoo was begun near a railway station for children, and according to the plan 45 hectares (110 acres) were allocated for it. To speed up construction it was decided to temporarily use only 2.25 hectares (5.6 acres) of the land and later expand the territory by constructing a circular railway for children at the zoo.\nIn 1979, head of executive power allocated necessary amount of money for the construction of the new zoo, which was lasted 5 years because of deficiency in financing. And at last, on September 1, 1985, new Baku zoo was brought into operation and was opened for visitors again, where it is located up to now.In 2001, according to order of head of the Executive Power of Baku 2 hectares (4.9 acres) was allocated to the zoo, expanding the total area of the zoo to 4.25 hectares (10.5 acres).\nIn 2008, six species of exotic animals were brought by airplane from Minsk to Baku zoo: couples of Nile crocodiles, nasuas, chinchillas, row deer, Egyptian dogs, and lynxes. It was in exchange for a young lion, which was sent from Baku to the capital of Belarus at the end of 2007.In 2010, constructional works began in the territories belonging to the zoo and in the result of this construction of a new railway station for children was totally reconstructed. Issue about resettlement of the zoo was put on the agenda again.\nSince 2000s, animal welfare organizations had concerns about conditions and public safety.\n\n\n== Project of new zoo ==\nAccording to order of Ilham Aliyev \u2013 the President of Azerbaijan, a new zoo with unique and rare kinds of flora and fauna will be constructed in Ceyranbatan village of Absheron rayon, about 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) from Baku. The amount of 2.85 million manats  was allocated from the president's fund for this purpose. Rare mammal and birds from different continents, especially from Australia will be located in the territory of the new zoological park, the area of which consists of 230 hectares (570 acres).

        "wiki": "The Government House of Baku, also known as House of Government, is a government building housing various state ministries of Azerbaijan. It is located on Neftchiler Avenue and faces the Baku Boulevard. The rear side of the building faces busy Uzeyir Hajibeyov Street of central Baku. Government House was designed for 5,500 people.\n\n\n== History of the building ==\nFrom 1924 to 1927, construction of several large government buildings was planned and included in the budget of Baku. In 1934, the Soviet authorities announced a tender for the construction of the Baku Soviet Palace (later renamed the Government House). The competition was won by well known architects Lev Rudnev, V.O. Munts and K. Tkachenko (participant). With some alterations to the project, the building of the Government House was built between 1936 and 1952. The construction of the building also led to construction of Lenin Square (later renamed to Azadliq Square) in front of the Government House. In 1955, a monument to Vladimir Lenin facing Azadliq Square sculpted by D.M. Garyaghdi was installed in front of the building. In addition to this, a large complex of buildings around the Government House was built in 1960 \u2013 1970s which included hotels \"Azerbaijan\" and \"Absheron\", 16-story buildings on Uzeyir Hajibeyov street, building of Az\u0259rpo\u00e7t. Lenin's statue was later removed during the Azerbaijani independence movement in the aftermath of bloody Black January. A large Azerbaijan flag now stands where Lenin's statue stood. Lenin square was renamed Azadliq Square (Freedom Square).\n\n\n== After independence ==\nThe building housed many organizations and business firms after restoration of Azerbaijani independence in 1991. After complete renovation of the building, all business firms were moved to other locations in the city and the offices were provided to governmental organizations. Among them, State Committee for Ecology and Environmental Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and Produce, State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources, State Committee for Hydrometeorology, State Committee for Material Resources, State Committee for Improvements of Soil and Water Economy.In 2006, the government of Azerbaijan started renovation works of the building and completed the project in 2010. $40.8 million Azerbaijani manats were spent for reconstruction and enrichment of the park surrounding the building. Being in the center of Baku, the Government House is among the mostly visited tourist attractions of Azerbaijan. \nCurrently, several ministries including Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population, State Procurement Agency (Azerbaijan) and Copyright Agency (Azerbaijan) of Azerbaijan Republic occupy the building offices.\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\nGovernment House of Baku\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMayoralty of Baku\nNeftchiler Avenue\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoogle Maps profile",

        "wiki": "Aliagha Vahid (Azerbaijani: \u018flia\u011fa Vahid), born Aliagha Mammadqulu oglu Isgandarov (17 February 1895, in Baku \u2013 1 October 1965, in Baku), was an Azerbaijani poet and Honoured Artist of the Azerbaijan SSR (1943). He was known for reintroducing medieval ghazel style in Soviet Azerbaijani poetry.\n\n\n== Life and creativity ==\nAliagha Vahid was born on February 17, 1895 in a family of a carpenter. From his earliest years he worked as an unskilled laborer and helped his father. His received his first education in madrasah, but not finishing it, entered the literary society \u201cMejmeush-shuara\u201d. There he befriended such poets as Muniri, Azer Imamaliyev and other popular poets of Baku of that epoch. Under their creative influence he wrote his first lyrical poems. In his early satirical poems he criticized social deficiencies in the society, superstition and narrow-mindedness, tyranny and unfairness. These poems would enter his first collection of poems titled The Result of Avidity. Later, under the influence of Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee\u2019s and Seyid Azim\u2019s works, he began to write ghazels. His ghazels were popular among people and that is why he was nicknamed Ghazelkhan.\nWahid greeted the October Revolution and establishment of the Soviet power in Azerbaijan enthusiastically. He actively agitated for the Soviet power in his poems, such as To My Comrade Laborers and Soldiers, What Does the School Mean, Elevate, my angel... and others. In 1924 Wahid got acquainted with Sergei Yesenin, who was living in Baku, in Mardakan village with short breaks. Later this acquaintanceship turned into a strong friendship. This fact was mentioned in writer-publicist Huseyngulu Najafov\u2019s \u201cMay of Balakhany\u201d narrative. After the establishment of the Soviet power and creation of the Azerbaijan SSR he collaborated with \u201cKommunist\u201d newspaper and satirical magazine \u201cMolla Nasraddin\u201d. In his collections called \u201cCouplets\u201d (1924) and \u201cMollakhana\u201d (1938) he vented satirical flaw of criticism to opponents of the new system. Battle Ghazels (1943) and Ghazels (1944), the books written during the Great Patriotic War, tackled love to the Motherland, hatred for the enemy and faith in victory.\nBeing the follower of Fuzuli's literary tendencies, Aliagha Vahid was an eminent representative of the gazel genre in the Soviet culture. Aliagha Wahid was also engaged in translation of ghazels of Nizami, Fuzuli, Khaqani and other classics into Azerbaijani language. He is assumed to be the founder of meykhana, the modern genre of ghazel.\nAliagha Wahid died on the night of 30 September 1965 in Baku and was buried in the Alley of Honor.\n\n\n== Memory ==\n\nA school, park, garden (former Gubernatorial garden), house of literature and a street in Baku were named after Aliagha Vahid.\nA large 1990 bronze bust of Vahid, incorporating allegorical figures into his hair, stands in a small garden area of Baku's Icheri Sheher just behind the metro station of the same name. It was moved to that location in 2009, having previously sat in the gardens of the Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall, on the south side of the city walls.\nIn 1991, a film titled Ghazelkhan, dedicated to Vahid's life and creativity, was shot at the film studio Azerbaijanfilm.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Gala State Historical Ethnographic Reserve is a complex of museums in Baku, Azerbaijan. Inside there are three different types of museums: Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography (open-air), Castle Museum (partly open-air), and the Museum of Antiques. Vehicles are offered to visitors due to the spacious area of museums. There are the tours in different languages: Azerbaijani, Russian, English, German and French.The museum is 1.5 ha in area and has rock paintings, pottery, household items, jewelry, weapons and coins belong to the ancient times of Azerbaijan. In this museum, there are more than 2,000 different archaeological and architectural monuments \u2013 mounds, seats of ancient settlements, burial places dating back to thousands of years ago. \nThe reserve was established in the year of 2008 under the auspices of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. It is located in Qala, 40km far from Baku and bears the name of this district. Gala- State Historical Ethnographic Reserve is devoted to the history of the Absheron Peninsula. As a result of archaeological excavations, it is feasible to get the picture of the lifestyle of the Azerbaijani people from ancient times to the Middle Ages.There is an 18th-century tandoor, two underground passages belonging to the 10th and 15th centuries. Besides these, old houses, portable tents made of animal skins, stone and straw houses with domes, an old smithy, a pottery workshop, and a thresher can be found. All these can be touched and photographed.\n\n\n== Gala Museum ==\n\nThere are 243 historic-architectural monuments (mosques, ancient living buildings, baths, coffee beans, walls of ancient houses, etc.) in the Gala Museum. There are also 400-year-old pistachio trees, figs, figs, olive trees, flowers and other decorative items in the territory of the reserve.In 2008, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex under the open sky was established. Archaeological architectural monuments discovered on the Absheron Peninsula were collected and restored here. The mounds, settlements and other architectural monuments of the 3rd-2nd millennium BC were built in the same way as before the era.\nAncient mounds, grave stones, dwellings, quarries, places of worship and some other material cultural remains found in the territory of Absheron Peninsula reflect the mood of the previous millennia. One of the mound is called \"Dubendi\". The basis of this mound is the rug-shaped stone masonry.\nTools made from sheep bones and stone were found in the Reserve area. The \"Turkan\" mound also consists of a ring-shaped stonework. There is also a quadrilateral hole in this mound.\nThere are residues of water and food wells, coffee houses, ancient houses in the territory of the reserve. Archaeological excavations have been proven to be the Bronze Age settlement 5,000 years ago in the village of Gala.\nIn the ancient village of Gala, there were a number of fields of art. One of them is pottery. Pottery products discovered during archaeological excavations in Galada are potentially interesting in terms of pottery. The ancient carpets, the tools used during the carpet weaving - the apron, the cloth, the scissors, the hooked knife. \nRock paintings and caves dating back to the new stone Bronze Age were discovered during the archaeological excavations in the Agdash Plain, Khashakhun and Dubendi in the vicinity of Gala village in the east of Absheron. As well as traces of settlements, mounds, hearths and material cultural remains have been discovered here.\nThere are three baths in the village of Gala: Shor Baths, Gum Baths and Bayramali Baths. The \"Shore Bath\" was located in the southern part of the village, near the salt lake. There was water from the lake.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Qala D\u00f6vl\u0259t Tarix-Etnoqrafya Qoru\u011fu at Wikimedia Commons",

Located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, it is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and has an 10 km (6.2 mi) long border with Turkey in the northwest.\nThe Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state. In 1920, the country was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, shortly before the dissolution of the USSR in the same year. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region seceded to form the Republic of Artsakh. The region and seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto independent with the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. These regions are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE.Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential republic. It is one of six independent Turkic states and an active member of the Turkic Council and the T\u00dcRKSOY community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 182 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1992), the Council of Europe, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OSCE, and the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program. It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Azerbaijan also holds observer status in the World Trade Organization.While around 97% of the population is Muslim, the Constitution of Azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist. Azerbaijan is a developing country and ranks 87th on the Human Development Index. It has a high rate of economic development and literacy, as well as a low rate of unemployment. However, the ruling party, the New Azerbaijan Party, in power since 1993, has been accused of authoritarian leadership and deteriorating the country's human rights record, including increasing restrictions on civil liberties, particularly on press freedom and political repression.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAccording to a modern etymology, the term Azerbaijan derives from that of Atropates, a Persian satrap under the Achaemenid Empire, who was later reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander the Great. The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant Zoroastrianism. In the Avesta's Frawardin Yasht (\"Hymn to the Guardian Angels\"), there is a mention of \u00e2terep\u00e2tahe ashaon\u00f4 fravash\u00eem \u00fdazamaide, which literally translates from Avestan as \"we worship the fravashi of the holy Atropatene.\" The name \"Atropates\" itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning \"Protected by the (Holy) Fire\" or \"The Land of the (Holy) Fire\". The Greek name was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo. Over the span of millennia, the name evolved to \u0100turp\u0101t\u0101k\u0101n (Middle Persian), then to \u0100dharb\u0101dhag\u0101n, \u0100dharb\u0101yag\u0101n, \u0100zarb\u0101ydj\u0101n (New Persian) and present-day Azerbaijan.\nThe name Azerbaijan was first adopted for the area of the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan by the government of Musavat in 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire, when the independent Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was established. Until then, the designation had been used exclusively to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran, while the area of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was formerly referred to as Arran and Shirvan. On that basis Iran protested the newly adopted country name.During the Soviet rule, the country was also spelled in Latin from the Russian transliteration as Azerbaydzhan (Russian: \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0301\u043d). The country's name was also spelled in Cyrillic script from 1940 to 1991 as \"\u0410\u0437\u04d9\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0458\u04b9\u0430\u043d\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azokh Cave.Early settlements included the Scythians in the 9th century BC. Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900\u2013700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism.\n\n\n=== From the Sasanid period to the Safavid period ===\n\nThe Sasanian Empire turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian marzban (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.\nIn the first half of the 7th century, Caucasian Albania, as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule due to the Muslim conquest of Persia. The Umayyad Caliphate repulsed both the Sasanians and Byzantines from Transcaucasia and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King Javanshir, was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the Sallarids, Sajids, and Shaddadids. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by the waves of Oghuz Turks from Central Asia, who adopted a Turkoman ethnonym at the time. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the Seljuk Empire, who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.\nThe pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijan spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages, among them Armenian and an Iranian language, Old Azeri, which was gradually replaced by a Turkic language, the early precursor of the Azerbaijani language of today. Some linguists have also stated that the Tati dialects of Iranian Azerbaijan and the Republic of Azerbaijan, like those spoken by the Tats, are descended from Old Azeri. Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuk Empire were ruled by Eldiguzids, technically vassals of the Seljuk sultans, but sometimes de facto rulers themselves. Under the Seljuks, local poets such as Nizami Ganjavi and Khaqani gave rise to a blossoming of Persian literature on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.\nThe local dynasty of the Shirvanshahs became a vassal state of Timur's Empire, and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival states emerged: Kara Koyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861, for numerous centuries to come. In 1501, the Safavid dynasty of Iran subdued the Shirvanshahs and gained its possessions. In the course of the next century, the Safavids converted the formerly Sunni population to Shia Islam, as they did with the population in what is modern-day Iran. The Safavids allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty, until 1538, when Safavid king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) completely deposed them, and made the area into the Safavid province of Shirvan. The Sunni Ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day Azerbaijan as a result of the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578\u20131590; by the early 17th century, they were ousted by Safavid Iranian ruler Abbas I (r. 1588\u20131629). In the wake of the demise of the Safavid Empire, Baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the Russians as a consequence of the Russo-Persian War of 1722\u20131723. Despite brief intermissions such as these by Safavid Iran's neighboring rivals, the land of what is today Azerbaijan remained under Iranian rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nAfter the Safavids, the area was ruled by the Iranian Afsharid dynasty. After the death of Nader Shah (r. 1736\u20131747), many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability. Numerous self-ruling khanates with various forms of autonomy emerged in the area. The rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of Iran, and were vassals and subjects of the Iranian shah. The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.Thereafter, the area was under the successive rule of the Iranian Zands and Qajars. From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. Russia now actively tried to gain possession of the Caucasus region which was, for the most part, in the hands of Iran. In 1804, the Russians invaded and sacked the Iranian town of Ganja, sparking the Russo-Persian War of 1804\u20131813. The militarily superior Russians ended the Russo-Persian War of 1804\u20131813 with a victory.\n\nFollowing Qajar Iran's loss in the 1804\u20131813 war, it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates, along with Georgia and Dagestan to the Russian Empire, per the Treaty of Gulistan.The area to the north of the river Aras, amongst which territory lies the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia in the 19th century. About a decade later, in violation of the Gulistan treaty, the Russians invaded Iran's Erivan Khanate. This sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two, the Russo-Persian War of 1826\u20131828. The resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay, forced Qajar Iran to cede sovereignty over the Erivan Khanate, the Nakhchivan Khanate and the remainder of the Lankaran Khanate, comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that were still in Iranian hands. After incorporation of all Caucasian territories from Iran into Russia, the new border between the two was set at the Aras River, which, upon the Soviet Union's disintegration, subsequently became part of the border between Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic.\nQajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century, which thus included the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic, while as a result of that cession, the Azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations: Iran and Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran far outnumber those in neighboring Azerbaijan.\nAfter the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was declared, constituting the present-day republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia.\nIt was followed by the March Days massacres that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of Baku and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, the leading Musavat party declared independence as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR), adopting the name of \"Azerbaijan\" for the new republic; a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the adjacent northwestern region of contemporary Iran. The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic in the Muslim world. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in the Muslim East.\n \nBy March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack Baku. Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia could not survive without Baku's oil. Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it, establishing the Azerbaijan SSR on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh, Azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 1918\u201320 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the Treaty of Kars. The previously independent Republic of Aras would also become the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of Zangezur and Turkey agreed to return Gyumri (then known as Alexandropol).\nDuring World War II, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the Soviet Union, with 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil on the Eastern Front being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals. Operation Edelweiss carried out by the German Wehrmacht targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo of the USSR. A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945. Approximately 681,000 people with over 100,000 of them women went to the front, while the total population of Azerbaijan was 3.4 million at the time. Some 250,000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front. More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named Heroes of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijani Major-General Azi Aslanov was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\n\nFollowing the politics of glasnost, initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to an already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in the Black January events in Baku. Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words \"Soviet Socialist\" from the title, adopted the \"Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic\" and restored the flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag. As a consequence of the failed coup which occurred in August in Moscow, on 18 October 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, while the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991. The country now celebrates its Independence Day on 18 October.The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-Karabakh war with the ethnic Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia. By the end of the hostilities in 1994, Armenians controlled up to 14-16 percent of Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh itself. During the war many atrocities were committed including the massacres at Malibeyli and Gushchular, the Garadaghly massacre, the Agdaban and the Khojaly massacres. Furthermore, an estimated 30,000 people have been killed and more than a million people have been displaced. Four United Nations Security Council Resolutions (822, 853, 874, and 884) demand for \"the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan.\" Many Russians and Armenians left and fled Azerbaijan as refugees during the 1990s. According to the 1970 census, there were 510,000 ethnic Russians and 484,000 Armenians in Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 1993, democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev. In 1994, Surat Huseynov, by that time the prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but he was arrested and charged with treason. A year later, in 1995, another coup was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the OMON special unit, Rovshan Javadov. The coup was averted, resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units. At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998, Aliyev was reelected for a second term. Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitation of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field and Shah Deniz gas field, Aliyev's presidency was criticized due to suspected election frauds, high levels of economic inequality and domestic corruption.Ilham Aliyev, Heydar Aliyev's son, became chairman of the New Azerbaijan Party as well as President of Azerbaijan when his father died in 2003. He was reelected to a third term as president in October 2013.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGeographically, Azerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe. It lies between latitudes 38\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 N, and longitudes 44\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 E. The total length of Azerbaijan's land borders is 2,648 km (1,645 mi), of which 1,007 kilometers are with Armenia, 756 kilometers with Iran, 480 kilometers with Georgia, 390 kilometers with Russia and 15 kilometers with Turkey. The coastline stretches for 800 km (497 mi), and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km (283 mi). The territory of Azerbaijan extends 400 km (249 mi) from north to south, and 500 km (311 mi) from west to east.\nThree physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the Caspian Sea, whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the Greater Caucasus mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center. There are also three mountain ranges, the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, and the Talysh Mountains, together covering approximately 40% of the country. The highest peak of Azerbaijan is Mount Bazard\u00fcz\u00fc (4,466 m), while the lowest point lies in the Caspian Sea (\u221228 m). Nearly half of all the mud volcanoes on Earth are concentrated in Azerbaijan, these volcanoes were also among nominees for the New7Wonders of Nature.The main water sources are surface waters. However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than 100 km (62 mi) in length. All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country. The largest lake is Sarysu (67 km\u00b2), and the longest river is Kur (1,515 km), which is transboundary with Armenia. Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometers.\nSince the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the Azerbaijani government has taken measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. National protection of the environment accelerated after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Within four years protected areas doubled and now makeup eight percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.\n\n\n=== Landscape ===\n\nAzerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's landmass consists of mountain ridges, crests, yailas, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400\u20131000 meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100\u2013120 meters, and others from 0\u201350 meters and up (Qobustan, Absheron). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consists of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about \u221228 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466 meters (Bazard\u00fcz\u00fc peak).The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold arctic air masses of Scandinavian anticyclone, temperate air masses of Siberian anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone. Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country. The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of subtropical climate on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high solar radiation rates.\n9 out of 11 existing climate zones are present in Azerbaijan. Both the absolute minimum temperature ( \u221233 \u00b0C or \u221227.4 \u00b0F ) and the absolute maximum temperature ( 46 \u00b0C or 114.8 \u00b0F ) were observed in Julfa and Ordubad \u2013 regions of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The maximum annual precipitation falls in Lankaran (1,600 to 1,800 mm or 63 to 71 in) and the minimum in Absheron (200 to 350 mm or 7.9 to 13.8 in).\n\nRivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) per year of water per square kilometer. All big water reservoirs are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea basin.\nThe Kura and Aras are the major rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the Kura-Aras Lowland. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur\u2013Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.\nYanar Dag, translated as \"burning mountain\", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku, which itself is known as the \"land of fire.\" Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nThe first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks, and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The national animal of Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse, a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However, today the horse is an endangered species.Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of higher plants. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus. About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole Caucasus can be found in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new Constitution on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the Constitution, the state symbols of the Azerbaijan Republic are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.\nThe Constitution of Azerbaijan states that it is a presidential republic with three branches of power \u2013 Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The legislative power is held by the unicameral National Assembly and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Parliament of Azerbaijan, called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies elected based on majority vote, with a term of 5 years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Parliament is not responsible for the formation of the government, but the Constitution requires the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers by Milli Majlis. The Yeni Azerbaijan Party, and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the 2010 Parliamentary election, the opposition parties, Musavat and Azerbaijani Popular Front Party, failed to win a single seat. European observers found numerous irregularities in the run-up to the election and on election day.The executive power is held by the President, who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the Prime Minister. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the President and the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and the Economic Court. The president nominates the judges in these courts. The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) report refers to the Azerbaijani justice model on the selection of new judges as best practice, reflecting the particular features and the course of development towards ensuring the independence and quality of the judiciary in a new democracy.Azerbaijan's system of governance nominally can be called two-tiered. The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan is determined by the Provision on Local Executive Authority (Yerli Icra Hakimiyati), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259) and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.\nAlthough Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as \"not free\" (on border with \"partly free\") by Freedom House. In recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities. A resolution adopted by the European Parliament in September 2015 described Azerbaijan as \"having suffered the greatest decline in democratic governance in all of Eurasia over the past ten years,\" noting as well that its dialogue with the country on human rights has \"not made any substantial progress.\" On 17 March 2016, the President of Azerbaijan signed a decree pardoning more than a dozen of the persons regarded as political prisoners by some NGOs. This decree was welcomed as a positive step by the US State Department. On 16 March 2017 another pardon decree was signed, which led to the release of additional persons regarded as political prisoners.Azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats in order to promote its causes abroad and legitimize its elections at home, a practice which has been termed as Caviar diplomacy. However, on 6 March 2017, ESISC (European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center) published a report called \"The Armenian Connection\", in which it attacked human rights NGOs and research organisations criticising human rights violations and corruption in Azerbaijan.\nESISC in that report asserted that the \"Caviar Diplomacy\" report elaborated by ESI aimed to create a climate of suspicion based on slander to form a network of MPs that would engage in a political war against Azerbaijan and that the network, composed of European PMs, Armenian officials, and some NGOs (Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, \"Human Rights House Foundation\", \"Open Dialog, European Stability Initiative, and Helsinki Committee for Human Rights) was financed by the Soros Foundation. According to Robert Coalson (Radio Free Europe), ESISC is a part of Baku's lobbying efforts to extend the use of front think tanks to shift public opinion. Freedom Files Analytical Centre said that \"The report is written in the worst traditions of authoritarian propaganda\".\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland. The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year. The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6 November 1996. Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran and Israel. Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its \"special relationship\" with Turkey.Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries so far and holds membership in 38 international organizations. It holds observer status in the Non-Aligned Movement and World Trade Organization and is a correspondent at the International Telecommunication Union. On 9 May 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly. The term of office began on 19 June 2006. Azerbaijan was first elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2011 with the support of 155 countries.\n\nForeign policy priorities of Azerbaijan include, first of all, the restoration of its territorial integrity; elimination of the consequences of occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other regions of Azerbaijan surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh; integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structure; contribution to international security; cooperation with international organizations; regional cooperation and bilateral relations; strengthening of defense capability; promotion of security by domestic policy means; strengthening of democracy; preservation of ethnic and religious tolerance; scientific, educational, and cultural policy and preservation of moral values; economic and social development; enhancing internal and border security; and migration, energy, and transportation security policy.Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism. Azerbaijan was one of the first countries to offer support after the September 11 attacks. The country is contributing to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Azerbaijan is an active member of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. It also maintains good relations with the European Union and could potentially one day apply for membership.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nAzerbaijan is divided into 10 economic regions; 66 rayons (rayonlar, singular rayon) and 77 cities (\u015f\u0259h\u0259rl\u0259r, singular \u015f\u0259h\u0259r) of which 12 are under the direct authority of the republic. Moreover, Azerbaijan includes the Autonomous Republic (muxtar respublika) of Nakhchivan. The President of Azerbaijan appoints the governors of these units, while the government of Nakhchivan is elected and approved by the parliament of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n\nNote: The cities under the direct authority of the republic in italics.\n\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nThe history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, when the National Army of the newly formed Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918. When Azerbaijan gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the Law on the Armed Forces of 9 October 1991. The original date of the establishment of the short-lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day (26 June) in today's Azerbaijan.\nAs of 2002, Azerbaijan had 95,000 active personnel in its armed forces. There are also 17,000 paramilitary troops. The armed forces have three branches: the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Navy. Additionally the armed forces embrace several military sub-groups that can be involved in state defense when needed. These are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service, which includes the Coast Guard as well. The Azerbaijan National Guard is a further paramilitary force. It operates as a semi-independent entity of the Special State Protection Service, an agency subordinate to the President.\n\nAzerbaijan adheres to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and has signed all major international arms and weapons treaties. Azerbaijan closely cooperates with NATO in programs such as Partnership for Peace and Individual Partnership Action Plan. Azerbaijan has deployed 151 of its Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq and another 184 in Afghanistan.The defense budget of Azerbaijan for 2011 was set at US$3.1 billion. In addition to that, $1.36 billion was planned to be used for the needs of the defense industry, which bring up the total military budget to 4.6 billion. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on 26 June 2011 that the defence spending reached $3.3 billion that year.Azerbaijan's defense budget for 2013 is $3.7 billion.Azerbaijani defense industry manufactures small arms, artillery systems, tanks, armors and noctovision devices, aviation bombs, pilotless vehicles, various military vehicles and military planes and helicopters.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks and non-banking credit organizations. The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are UniBank and the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan, run by Dr. Jahangir Hajiyev.\nPushed up by spending and demand growth, the 2007 Q1 inflation rate reached 16.6%. Nominal incomes and monthly wages climbed 29% and 25% respectively against this figure, but price increases in the non-oil industry encouraged inflation. Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called \"Dutch disease\" because of its fast-growing energy sector, which causes inflation and makes non-energy exports more expensive.\nIn the early 2000s the chronically high inflation was brought under control. This led to the launch of a new currency, the new Azerbaijani manat, on 1 January 2006, to cement the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as one of the top 10 reformers by the World Bank's Doing Business Report.\nAzerbaijan led the world as the top reformer in 2007/08, with improvements on seven out of 10 indicators of regulatory reform. Azerbaijan started operating a one-stop shop in January 2008 that halved the time, cost and number of procedures to start a business. Business registrations increased by 40% in the first six months. Azerbaijan also eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of $1,100, more than doubling the number of borrowers covered by the credit registry. Also, taxpayers can now file forms and pay their taxes online. Azerbaijan's extensive reforms moved it far up the ranks, from 97 to 33 in the overall ease of doing business.\nAzerbaijan is also ranked 57th in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2010\u20132011, above other CIS countries. By 2012 the GDP of Azerbaijan had increased 20-fold from its 1995 level.According to World Bank's Doing Business report 2019, Azerbaijan improved its position in the Ease of doing business rank from 57 to 25. As a result of implementing a record number of reforms mainly involving institutional changes among the 10 top improvers, to do business in Azerbaijan became easier, such as time and cost to get construction permit reduced significantly (time by 80 days and cost by 12.563 AZN), process of connecting electricity grid rationalized, as well as getting credit simplified.\n\n\n=== Energy and natural resources ===\n \n\nTwo-thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas.\n\nThe history of the oil industry of Azerbaijan dates back to the ancient period. Arabian historian and traveler Ahmed Al-Belaruri discussed the economy of the Absheron peninsula in antiquity, mentioning its oil in particular. There are many pipelines in Azerbaijan.\nThe region of the Lesser Caucasus accounts for most of the country's gold, silver, iron, copper, titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore and antimony. In September 1994, a 30-year contract was signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and 13 oil companies, among them Amoco, BP, ExxonMobil, Lukoil and Equinor. As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and development. Meanwhile, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure macroeconomic stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and safeguarding of resources for future generations.\nAccess to biocapacity in Azerbaijan is less than world average. In 2016, Azerbaijan had 0.8 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, half the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Azerbaijan used 2.1 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use more biocapacity than Azerbaijan contains. As a result, Azerbaijan is running a biocapacity deficit.Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, intends to ensure full gasification of the country by 2021.\nAzerbaijan is one of the sponsors of the east\u2013west and north\u2013south energy transport corridors. Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Kars railway line will connect the Caspian region with Turkey, is expected to be completed in July 2017. The Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) and Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) will deliver natural gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas to Turkey and Europe.\nAzerbaijan extended the agreement on development of ACG until 2050 according to the amended PSA signed on 14 September 2017 by SOCAR and co-ventures (BP, Chevron, INPEX, Equinor, ExxonMobil, TP, ITOCHU and ONGC Videsh).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAzerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region. About 54.9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural land. At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area. In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m\u00b3. Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, green vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants. In some areas it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products. The Caspian fishing industry concentrates on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga. In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.Some products previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally. Among them are Coca-Cola by Coca-Cola Bottlers LTD., beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating Azerbaijan.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays. In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also become a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism. During winter, the Shahdag Mountain Resort offers skiing with state of the art facilities.\nThe government of Azerbaijan has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination as a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy. These activities are regulated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan.\nThere are 63 countries which have visa-free score.\nE-visa \u2013 for a visit of foreigners of visa-required countries to the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nAccording to Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 of the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan holds 84th place.According to a report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, Azerbaijan was among the top ten countries showing the strongest growth in visitor exports between 2010 and 2016, In addition, Azerbaijan placed first (46.1%) among countries with the fastest-developing travel and tourism economies, with strong indicators for inbound international visitor spending last year.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road and the south\u2013north corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country's economy. The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport.\nAzerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets. The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field. Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.\nIn 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. Priorities are upgrading the transport network and improving transportation services in order to better facilitate the development of other sectors of the economy.\nThe 2012 construction of Kars\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Baku railway was meant to improve transportation between Asia and Europe by connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east to the European railway system in the west via Turkey. In 2010 Broad-gauge railways and electrified railways stretched for 2,918 km (1,813 mi) and 1,278 km (794 mi) respectively. By 2010, there were 35 airports and one heliport.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nIn the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation. The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable to those from oil production.Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector, mostly uninfluenced by the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008; rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years.The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. The Ministry of Communications & Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator. Public payphones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks. Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. As of 2009, there were 1,397,000 main telephone lines and 1,485,000 internet users. There are four GSM providers: Azercell, Bakcell, Azerfon (Nar Mobile), Nakhtel mobile network operators and one CDMA.\nIn the 21st century a number of prominent Azerbaijani geodynamics and geotectonics scientists, inspired by the fundamental works of Elchin Khalilov and others, designed hundreds of earthquake prediction stations and earthquake-resistant buildings that now constitute the bulk of The Republican Center of Seismic Service.The Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency launched its first satellite AzerSat 1 into orbit on 7 February 2013 from Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana at orbital positions 46\u00b0 East. The satellite covers Europe and a significant part of Asia and Africa and serves the transmission of TV and radio broadcasting as well as the Internet. The launching of a satellite into orbit is Azerbaijan's first step in realizing its goal of becoming a nation with its own space industry, capable of successfully implementing more projects in the future.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nas of January 2019, 52.8% of Azerbaijan's total population of 9,981,457 is urban, with the remaining 47.2% being rural. 50.1% of the total population is female. The sex ratio in the same year was 0.99 males per female.The 2011 population growth-rate was 0.85%, compared to 1.09% worldwide. A significant factor restricting population growth is a high level of migration. In 2011 Azerbaijan saw a migration of \u22121.14/1,000 people.The Azerbaijani diaspora is found in 42 countries and in turn there are many centers for ethnic minorities inside Azerbaijan, including the German cultural society \"Karelhaus\", Slavic cultural center, Azerbaijani-Israeli community, Kurdish cultural center, International Talysh Association, Lezgin national center \"Samur\", Azerbaijani-Tatar community, Crimean Tatars society, etc.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe ethnic composition of the population according to the 2009 population census: 91.60% Azerbaijanis, 2.02% Lezgians, 1.35% Armenians (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh), 1.34% Russians, 1.26% Talysh, 0.56% Avars, 0.43% Turks, 0.29% Tatars, 0.28% Tats, 0.24% Ukrainians, 0.14% Tsakhurs, 0.11% Georgians, 0.10% Jews, 0.07% Kurds, other 0.21%.\n\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\n\nIn total, Azerbaijan has 78 cities, 63 city districts, and one special legal status city. These are followed by 261 urban-type settlements and 4248 villages.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language is Azerbaijani, which is a Turkic language. Azerbaijani is spoken by approximately 92% of the population as a mother tongue. Russian and Armenian (only in Nagorno-Karabakh) are also spoken, and each are the mother tongue of around 1.5% of the population respectively. Russian and English play significant roles as second or third languages of education and communication. There are a dozen other minority languages spoken natively in the country. Avar, Budukh, Georgian, Juhuri, Khinalug, Kryts, Lezgian, Rutul, Talysh, Tat, Tsakhur, and Udi are all spoken by small minorities. Some of these language communities are very small and their numbers are decreasing. Armenian is almost exclusively spoken in the break-away Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAround 97% of the population are Muslims. 85% of the Muslims are Shia and 15% Sunni; the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest proportion of Shia Muslims of any country in the world. Other faiths are practised by the country's various ethnic groups. Under article 48 of its Constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom. In a 2006\u20132008 Gallup poll, only 21% of respondents from Azerbaijan stated that religion is an important part of their daily lives.Of the nation's religious minorities, the estimated 280,000 Christians (3.1%) are mostly Russian and Georgian Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh). In 2003, there were 250 Roman Catholics. Other Christian denominations as of 2002 include Lutherans, Baptists and Molokans. There is also a small Protestant community. Azerbaijan also has an ancient Jewish population with a 2,000-year history; Jewish organizations estimate that 12,000 Jews remain in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan also is home to members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, Hare Krishna and Jehovah's Witnesses communities, as well as adherents of the other religious communities. Some religious communities have been unofficially restricted from religious freedom. A U.S. State Department report on the matter mentions detention of members of certain Muslim and Christian groups, and many groups have difficulty registering with the SCWRA.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nA relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects. In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from Perso-Arabic script to Latin in the 1920s and from Roman to Cyrillic in the 1930s. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970. According to the United Nations Development Program Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to adopt a modified-Latin alphabet to replace Cyrillic. Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change. Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of preschools, general secondary schools, and vocational schools, including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences; that's why Azerbaijanis are, in many ways, bi-cultural. Today, national traditions are well preserved in the country despite Western influences, including globalized consumer culture. Some of the main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and Novruz Bayram. The latter is derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in the ancient Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism. Novruz is a family holiday.The profile of Azerbaijan's population consists, as stated above, of Azerbaijanis, as well as other nationalities or ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the Chokha and Papakhi. There are radio broadcasts in Russian, Georgian, Kurdish, Lezgian and Talysh languages, which are financed from the state budget. Some local radio stations in Balakan and Khachmaz organize broadcasts in Avar and Tat. In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (Dengi Kurd), Lezgian (Samur) and Talysh languages. Jewish society \"Sokhnut\" publishes the newspaper Aziz.\n\n\n=== Music and folk dances ===\n\nMusic of Azerbaijan builds on folk traditions that reach back nearly a thousand years. For centuries Azerbaijani music has evolved under the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies. Azerbaijani music has a branchy mode system, where chromatization of major and minor scales is of great importance. Among national musical instruments there are 14 string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments. According to The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \"in terms of ethnicity, culture and religion the Azerbaijani are musically much closer to Iran than Turkey.\"\n\nMugham, meykhana and ashiq art are among the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. Mugham is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes. When performing mugham, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music. In contrast to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azerbaijani mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of jazz. UNESCO proclaimed the Azerbaijani mugham tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003. Meykhana is a kind of traditional Azerbaijani distinctive folk unaccompanied song, usually performed by several people improvising on a particular subject.\nAshiq combines poetry, storytelling, dance, and vocal and instrumental music into a traditional performance art that stands as a symbol of Azerbaijani culture. It is a mystic troubadour or traveling bard who sings and plays the saz. This tradition has its origin in the Shamanistic beliefs of ancient Turkic peoples. Ashiqs' songs are semi-improvised around common bases. Azerbaijan's ashiq art was included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage by the UNESCO on 30 September 2009.Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced Azerbaijani pop music, in its various forms, that has been growing in popularity in Azerbaijan, while genres such as rock and hip hop are widely produced and enjoyed. Azerbaijani pop and Azerbaijani folk music arose with the international popularity of performers like Alim Qasimov, Rashid Behbudov, Vagif Mustafazadeh, Muslim Magomayev, Shovkat Alakbarova and Rubaba Muradova. Azerbaijan is an enthusiastic participant in the Eurovision Song Contest. Azerbaijan made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The country's entry gained third place in 2009 and fifth the following year. Ell and Nikki won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song \"Running Scared\", entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012, in Baku. They have qualified for every Grand Final up until the 2018 edition of the contest, entering with X My Heart by singer Aisel\nThere are dozens of Azerbaijani folk dances. They are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like the Chokha, which is well-preserved within the national dances. Most dances have a very fast rhythm. The national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nAmong the medieval authors born within the territorial limits of modern Azerbaijani Republic was Persian poet and philosopher Nizami, called Ganjavi after his place of birth, Ganja, who was the author of the Khamseh (\"The Quintuplet\"), composed of five romantic poems, including \"The Treasure of Mysteries,\" \"Khosrow and Sh\u012br\u012bn,\" and \"Leyli and Mejn\u016bn.\"The earliest known figure in Azerbaijani literature was Izzeddin Hasanoglu, who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Turkic ghazals. In Persian ghazals he used his pen-name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu.Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in the 14th century based on the various Early Middle Ages dialects of Tabriz and Shirvan. Among the poets of this period were Gazi Burhanaddin, Haqiqi (pen-name of Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu), and Habibi. The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nesimi, one of the greatest Turkic Hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in Turkic literary history, who also composed poetry in Persian and Arabic. The divan and ghazal styles were further developed by poets Qasim al-Anvar, Fuzuli and Khatai (pen-name of Safavid Shah Ismail I).\nThe Book of Dede Korkut consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century, was not written earlier than the 15th century. It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads. The 16th-century poet, Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical Qazals in Arabic, Persian, and Azerbaijani. Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include The Divan of Ghazals and The Qasidas. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik (Azerbaijani: A\u015f\u0131q) poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khat\u0101\u012b (Arabic: \u062e\u0637\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u200e for sinner) Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani, which were later published as his Divan. A unique literary style known as qoshma (Azerbaijani: qo\u015fma for improvization) was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah Tahmasp I.\nIn the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well Ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as Qovsi of Tabriz, Shah Abbas Sani, Agha Mesih Shirvani, Nishat, Molla Vali Vidadi, Molla Panah Vagif, Amani, Zafar and others. Along with Turks, Turkmens and Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis also celebrate the Epic of Koroglu (from Azerbaijani: kor o\u011flu for blind man's son), a legendary folk hero. Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, Akinchi was published in 1875. In the mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of Baku, Ganja, Shaki, Tbilisi, and Yerevan. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the University of Saint Petersburg in Russia.\n\n\n=== Folk art ===\n\nAzerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is decorative and applied art. This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone, and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers, and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.\nThe Azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with a dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage by UNESCO.\n\nAzerbaijan has been since ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well-developed agriculture, stock raising, metalworking, pottery, ceramics, and carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological sites in Dashbulaq, Hasansu, Zayamchai, and Tovuzchai uncovered from the BTC pipeline have revealed early Iron Age artifacts.Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. Scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Kerimov, a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table. Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the Caspian Sea, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice plov is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and black tea is the national beverage. Azerbaijanis often use traditional armudu (pear-shaped) glass as they have very strong tea culture. Popular traditional dishes include bozbash (lamb soup that exists in several regional varieties with the addition of different vegetables), qutab (fried turnover with a filling of greens or minced meat) and dushbara (sort of dumplings of dough filled with ground meat and flavor).\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nAzerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of East and West. Azerbaijiani architecture has heavy influences from Persian architecture. Many ancient architectural treasures such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the Walled City of Baku survive in modern Azerbaijan. Entries submitted on the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list include the Ateshgah of Baku, Momine Khatun Mausoleum, Hirkan National Park, Binegadi National Park, L\u00f6kbatan Mud Volcano, Baku Stage Mountain, Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions, Shusha National Reserve, Ordubad National Reserve and the Palace of Shaki Khans.Among other architectural treasures are Quadrangular Castle in Mardakan, Parigala in Yukhary Chardaglar, a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the Baku subways are noted for their lavish decor.The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Major projects such as Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center, Flame Towers, Baku Crystal Hall, Baku White City and SOCAR Tower have transformed the country's skyline and promotes its contemporary identity.\n\n\n=== Visual art ===\n\nAzerbaijani art includes one of the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered as Gamigaya Petroglyphs in the territory of Ordubad Rayon are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks. Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl was convinced that people from the area went to Scandinavia in about 100 AD, took their boat building skills with them, and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe.Over the centuries, Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes. Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of Azim Azimzade and Bahruz Kangarli, and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs. Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years, from the Romanesque and Ottoman periods, and through the Soviet and Baroque periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Azerbaijan. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include Sattar Bahlulzade, Togrul Narimanbekov, Tahir Salahov, Alakbar Rezaguliyev, Mirza Gadim Iravani, Mikayil Abdullayev and Boyukagha Mirzazade.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nThe film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography. Therefore, it is not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku \u2013 at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the Caspian was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work. In 1919, during the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence was filmed on the first anniversary of Azerbaijan's independence from Russia, 27 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku. After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation.In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choices of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.\n\n\n=== Media and media freedom ===\n\nThere are three state-owned television channels: AzTV, Idman TV and Medeniyyet TV. There is one public channel and 6 private channels: \u0130ctimai Television, ANS TV, Space TV, Lider TV, Azad Azerbaijan TV, Xazar TV and Region TV.\n\n\n=== Human rights in Azerbaijan ===\n\nThe Constitution of Azerbaijan claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014, the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated rapidly under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (May\u2013November 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm. All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country.According to the 2013 Freedom House Freedom of the Press report, Azerbaijan's press freedom status is \"not free,\" and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries.Christianity is officially recognized, but in practice it is often oppressed. All religious communities are required to register to be allowed to meet, under the risk of imprisonment. This registration is often denied. \"Racial discrimination contributes to the country\u2019s lack of religious freedom, since many of the Christians are ethnic Armenian or Russian, rather than Azeri Muslim.\"Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America are banned in Azerbaijan. Discrimination against LGBT people in Azerbaijan is widespread.During the last few years, three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations. Azerbaijan had the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe in 2015, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and is the 5th most censored country in the world, ahead of Iran and China. Some critical journalists have been arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Azerbaijan.A report by an Amnesty International researcher in October 2015 points to '...the severe deterioration of human rights in Azerbaijan over the past few years. Sadly Azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society'. Amnesty's 2015/16 annual report on the country stated ' ... persecution of political dissent continued. Human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work. At least 18 prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year. Reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad, while their family members also faced harassment and arrests. International human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment persisted.'\nThe Guardian reported in April 2017 that \"Azerbaijan's ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (\u00a32.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies .... Leaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. Some of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country.\" There was no suggestion that all recipients were aware of the source of the money as it arrived via a disguised route.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nFreestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's national sport, in which Azerbaijan won up to fourteen medals, including four golds since joining the International Olympic Committee. Currently, the most popular sports include football and wrestling.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Azerbaijan, and the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan with 9,122 registered players, is the largest sporting association in the country. The national football team of Azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs. The most successful Azerbaijani football clubs are Neftchi Baku, Qaraba\u011f, and Gabala. In 2012, Neftchi Baku became the first Azerbaijani team to advance to the group stage of a European competition, beating APOEL of Cyprus 4\u20132 on aggregate in the play-off round of the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League. In 2014, Qaraba\u011f became the second Azerbaijani club advancing to the group stage of UEFA Europa League. In 2017, after beating Copenhagen 2\u20132(a) in the play-off round of the UEFA Champions League, Qaraba\u011f became the first Azerbaijani club to reach the Group stage. Futsal is another popular sport in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan national futsal team reached fourth place in the 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship, while domestic club Araz Nax\u00e7ivan clinched bronze medals at the 2009\u201310 UEFA Futsal Cup and 2013\u201314 UEFA Futsal Cup. Azerbaijan was the main sponsor of Spanish football club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid during seasons 2013/2014 and 2014/2015, a partnership that the club described should 'promote the image of Azerbaijan in the world'.Azerbaijan is one of the traditional powerhouses of world chess, having hosted many international chess tournaments and competitions and became European Team Chess Championship winners in 2009, 2013 and 2017. Notable chess players from country's chess schools that made a great impact on the game in world, includes Teimour Radjabov, Shahriyar Mammadyarov, Vladimir Makogonov, Vugar Gashimov and former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov. As of 2014, country's home of Shamkir Chess a category 22 event and one of the highest rated tournaments of all time.Backgammon also plays a major role in Azerbaijani culture. The game is very popular in Azerbaijan and is widely played among the local public. There are also different variations of backgammon developed and analyzed by Azerbaijani experts.\n\nAzerbaijan Women's Volleyball Super League is one of strongest women leagues in world. Its women's national team came fourth at the 2005 European Championship. Over the last years, clubs like Rabita Baku and Azerrail Baku achieved great success at European cups. Azerbaijani volleyball players include likes of Valeriya Korotenko, Oksana Parkhomenko, Inessa Korkmaz, Natalya Mammadova and Alla Hasanova.\nOther well-known Azerbaijani athletes are Namig Abdullayev, Toghrul Asgarov, Rovshan Bayramov, Sharif Sharifov, Mariya Stadnik and Farid Mansurov in wrestling, Nazim Huseynov, Elnur Mammadli, Elkhan Mammadov and Rustam Orujov in judo, Rafael Aghayev in karate, Magomedrasul Majidov and Aghasi Mammadov in boxing, Nizami Pashayev in Olympic weightlifting, Azad Asgarov in pankration, Eduard Mammadov in kickboxing, and K-1 fighter Zabit Samedov.\nAzerbaijan has a Formula One race-track, made in June 2012, and the country hosted its first Formula One Grand Prix on 19 June 2016 and the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Other annual sporting events held in the country are the Baku Cup tennis tournament and the Tour d'Azerba\u00efdjan cycling race.\nAzerbaijan hosted several major sport competitions since the late 2000s, including the 2013 F1 Powerboat World Championship, 2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships, 2010 European Wrestling Championships, 2009 Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships, 2014 European Taekwondo Championships, 2014 Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships, and 2016 World Chess Olympiad. On 8 December 2012, Baku was selected to host the 2015 European Games, the first to be held in the competition's history. Baku is also set to host the fourth Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017 And 2019 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival in 2019 And also One of the hosts of UEFA Euro 2020\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Azerbaijan\nIndex of Azerbaijan-related articles\nAran to Azerbaijan name change\nAzerbaijani language\nAzerbaijan (newspaper)\nList of World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan\nSOCAR\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nOlukbasi, Suha.

        "wiki": "The Absheron Peninsula (Azerbaijani: Ab\u015feron yar\u0131madas\u0131) is a peninsula in Azerbaijan. It is the location of Baku, the biggest and the most populous city of the country, and also the Baku metropolitan area, with its satellite cities Sumqayit and Khyrdalan.\nThere are three districts, of which two are urban (Baku and Sumqayit), and one, (Absheron Rayon), is suburban district in Absheron region.\nIt extends 60 km (37 mi) eastward into the Caspian Sea, and reaches a maximum width of 30 km (19 mi). Though technically the easternmost extension of the Caucasus Mountains, the landscape is only mildly hilly, a gently undulating plain that ends in a long spit of sand dunes known as Shah Dili, and now declared the Absheron National Park. In this part the peninsula is dissected by ravines and characterized by frequent salt lakes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Absheron\" comes from Persian \u0101b \u0161uran (salty waters). This also gave its name to the city of Apsheronsk in Russia.\nAccording to Conrad Malte-Brun in 1810, an alternative name for the peninsula was Okoressa.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the late 19th century exploitation of the peninsula's petroleum resources caused large scale migrations of Iranian laborers to the Caucasus and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Absheron peninsula is located in eastern Azerbaijan, along the western coast of the Caspian Sea with layers of deposits from the Cretaceous, Palaeogene, Neogene, Pliocene and Quaternary periods. The lithological composition up to the Neogene layers is made up of clays, sandy clays, sands and limestones. Middle Pliocene sediments are sandy clays. These are thick in areas with highly mineralized groundwaters. Fresh groundwater is unable to permeate the thick clays to reach underlying sequences, by the overlying layers of sediment deposits have a lower salinity. In the western areas of the peninsula there are outcrops of low permeability clays from the Cretaceous, Palaogene, Neogene, and Lower Pilocene. These clays are deeper in the eastern areas and covered by Quaternary sediments. Although the peninsula is tectonically a southeast continuous of the Greater Caucasus, its Quarternary deposits are isolated.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe Absheron Peninsula has a temperate semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSk) with warm and dry summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. The peninsula is the most arid part of Azerbaijan (precipitation here is around or less than 200 mm (8 in) a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons are particularly wet. The natural vegetation of the Absheron Peninsula is dry steppe and semi-desert. Due to the semi-arid climate, local agriculture requires irrigation.\n\n\n== Environmental issues ==\nPetrochemical and refining industries on the peninsula have had environmental impacts on the Caspian Sea shore and the sea itself.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, the Absheron Peninsula was the site of some of the world's earliest petroleum production. Much of the landscape remains scarred with rusting oil derricks. Despite serious problems with environmental damage and pollution, the Absheron is known for its flowers, horticulture, mulberries and figs. The northern coast has wide though less-than-pristine beaches which are popular local tourist attractions.\nWealthy people have settled in the Absheron Peninsula, including Robert Nobel and Zeynalabdin Taghiyev.\n\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThere are natural resources such as oil, lime, sand and salt in the peninsula. The peninsula has famous lakes like Masazir, Khojahasan and Boyuk Shor. Several ancient oil wells of the world are located in the Absheron Peninsula. Azerbaijan is in the first place for the variety of mud volcanoes in Absheron. 400 out of 800 mud volcanoes in the Asia (1100 in the world) are located within the Southern Caspian oil-gas basin as well as in the dry areas of Azerbaaijan and other islands in the water area of the Caspian Sea.\n\n\n== Main roads ==\nThe main highways of the country are in Baku and the Absheron Peninsula. These are the highways of Heydar Aliyev International Airport, Sea port, Baku Railway Station and others which connect the capital to other regions of the country. \nMajor oil and gas pipelines go through here. Baku TRACECA (Transport Corridor Europe\u2013the Caucasus\u2013Asia) is the major point of the international traffic corridor. Within this project, Azerbaijan participates in the re-establishment of the historic Silk Road. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeography of Azerbaijan\nShort Documentary about pollution from chemical and oil industries on the peninsula",

The mosque is also known as Siniggala, for the name of its minaret \u2013 Siniggala (\u201cdamaged tower\u201d). The mosque acquired its second name in 1723, when military squadron of Russian Army, consisting of 15 warships and led by Admiral Matyushkin, approached the city from seaside and demanded its surrender during the Russo-Persian War (1722-1723). Russian warships began to bomb the city after the refusal to surrender. One of the Russian shells hit the minaret of Muhammad Mosque and damaged it. A stormy wind then blew the Russian ships further out to sea. The population of the city interpreted the wind as a divine scourge sent to the occupants. From that time until the middle of the 19th century, the minaret of the mosque wasn\u2019t reconstructed.  It remained a symbol of the persistence and courage of the defendants of the tower.It is the first building in Azerbaijan, which is related to Islam and dated for its architectural ligature.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nAccording to Arabic inscription which was saved in front of doorway of northern wall of the mosque, it was built by ustad-rais Muhammad the son of Abu Bakr in 471 of Hijra (1078/79). It means that the architect was not only a master-ustad, but also a rais-head of artificers\u2019 corporation.\n\n\n== Minaret ==\nMinaret adjoins new mosque, which was constructed on the basis of the older one\u2019s plan. Trunk of the minaret is strong and slightly thinning. It is constructed from carefully drafted stone. Coarse and flat stalactites of tabling retain sherefe \u2013 muezzin\u2019s balcony enclosed by stone plates. A ribbed dome completes the trunk of minaret. Narrow winding stairs are winded within the trunk. Ligature with Koranic inscription was traced under the tabling with archaic kufi alphabet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Muhammad Mosque (Baku) at Wikimedia Commons",

The voices of three male characters - the Father, the Guest, the Son - was performed by the Kiev actor Vitaly Linetsky. The sound design of the film was performed by well-known Ukrainian musician and TV showman - Miroslav Kuvaldin. The final edition of the sound was made by Igor Podolchak and Igor Durych in 2011.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe score was written and performed by Alexander Schetinsky. Initially, the director and composer planned to use the traditional musical genre Dies irae, which is part of the Catholic Mass. Were written six completed instrumental parts, named according to the sections of the Latin mass: Dies irae, Quantus tremor, Mors stupebit, Ingemisco, Tuba mirum, Lacrimosa.\nThe composer limited himself to the means of the symphony orchestra and did not use any text or vocals. The music does not contain direct illustrations, and, in particular, thanks to avant-garde style techniques, paradoxically combined with names, appealing to the surrealism principles, which fully corresponded to the aesthetics of the film. However, during the work the authors decided to use only two musical parts - Mors stupebit at the beginning of the film (initial titles) and Dies irae on the final credits.During the unfolding of the film, music does not sound at all. Thanks to this, the initial and final musical fragments acquired additional dramatic significance: an introduction to the \"problematic\" of the film (the effect of tuning on the corresponding aesthetic \"wave\") and a semantic generalization.\n\n\n== Interpretations ==\n\nLike in his first film Las Meninas, Deliriu appeals to the intricate family sagas, which appear in the novels by Witold Gombrowicz, Milorad Pavic, and Bruno Schulz.\nUnlike the sagas Luchino Visconti (The Damned) or Ingmar Bergman (Fanny and Alexander), Podol'chak avoids narrative but everything happens outside the space-time continuum with a focus on psychological states. His characters are arbitrary, which is emphasized by archetypal names: Father, Mother, Daughter.\nDeveloping the themes set in his first film Las Meninas, Podolchak in Delirium somewhat modifies the \"family\" structure - introduces into the hermetic nightmare the \"other\" character - the person from the side. But this \"stranger\" (the main character is the Psychiatrist, a kind of heir to the narrator from The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe) shows himself not as an alien body. His invasion does not cause any changes in the \"family organism\". The family absorbs the \"alien\", turning him into a full participant of a strange game, the exit of which does not exist.From the point of view of cinematic genres, more accurately subgenres, Delirium can be attributed to the so-called \"stories about the house with no way out\" or \"stories of houses with ghosts.\" From the films of the first category, the closest is Singapore Sling and See You in Hell, My Darling by Nikos Nikolaidis. From the films of the second category, you can, for comparison, recall The House on Telegraph Hill by Robert Wise and The Others by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar. But unlike the films by Wise and Amenabar, in Podolchak's Delirium the spectator encounters the concept of \"erroneous suspense\" when the director seems to create an atmosphere of anxious anticipation, but these premonitions of something terrible are being destroyed by the characters' inadequate reaction on them.\nSuspense, performed by Podolchak, is self-destructing. It has no point of view \"from the outside\", there is no coordinate of \"normality\", relating to which the viewer is able to oppose herself/himself to screen suspense. The viewer becomes this obscurity. Thus Podolchak provokes a feeling of acute claustrophobia - there is no way out from Podolchak's \"home-world\". The spectator, like the characters, does not know is there anything beyond the boundaries of the place where she/he is at the moment. Since \"this moment\" has the ability to loop, then the flight \"from here\" becomes simply impossible.\n\n\n== Award and Nominations ==\nAward\n\n2013 - First Prize.

        "wiki": "Baku Olympic Stadium (Azerbaijani: Bak\u0131 Olimpiya Stadionu), is a 68,700-seat stadium, designed and constructed to meet the international standards for stadiums set by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It is the largest stadium in Azerbaijan.\nConstruction of the 225,000-square-meter stadium on a 650,000-square-meter site was completed in February 2015. The six-storey, 65.7 meter structure near Boyukshor Lake, Baku, Azerbaijan, opened on 6 March 2015. The main tenant of the stadium is Azerbaijan's national football team, who moved from their previous home at the Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium. In June 2015 the stadium served as the main venue for the European Games, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, and the athletic games. The venue is intended to host the quarterfinals and three of the group games for UEFA Euro 2020. A green area is being developed around the stadium, which is accessible via public transport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The foundation ceremony ===\nThe foundation of the Baku Olympic Stadium was laid on 6 June 2011 in a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of Azerbaijani football.\nThe ceremony was attended by the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and his spouse Mehriban Aliyeva, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, UEFA president Michel Platini, prominent members of the global football community, heads of various federations, football veterans and other guests. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev was informed about the future plans for the construction of the stadium. Speaking at the ceremony, Blatter said:\n\n\"This is really beautiful, grand building, and more than 60 thousand football fans coming to the stadium will be able to enjoy football.\"Aliyev then placed a symbolic metal capsule inside a football. His son Heydar, scoring a goal in a symbolic gate, dropped the ball into the foundation. Presidents Aliyev with Blatter and Platini, operated a switch starting the concrete pour, and signed a football, which was preserved in memory of the ceremony.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nDespite the groundbreaking ceremony taking place in 2011, the construction of the stadium started only in November 2012 with the excavation and backfilling of the stadium area.\nThe stadium was completed on February 28, 2015, and the opening took place on 6 March 2015. President Aliyev participated in the opening ceremony.\nThe total layout of the stadium is 617,000m\u00b2 and has a capacity for 68,000 people. It is six stories tall.\n\nBaku was ready to host the first European Games in 2015. The Olympic Stadium Project was seen as the most important and prestigious project undertaken by Azerbaijan for the games. Main stadium layout area is 87,000m\u00b2, total confined space 215,000 m\u00b2, Maximum Height from ground 60m\u00b2.\nThe project was funded by the SOCAR. A Turkish company Tekfen Construction and Installation Co.,Inc, were given a design & build contract.Along with the stadium, there were built a number of hotels, a parking venue (3,617 car places), and green space (81,574 square meters).Stadium contains VVIP, VIP - CIP Suites total 127 each with 720 spectators capacity, total interior special area of 25,200m\u00b2 and total car parking capacity for 3,078 cars. 1,800 seating capacity warm up area, MEP Building, information centre and two external buildings are other building of the Project.\n\n\n== Events ==\nThe stadium hosted athletics and ceremonies during 2015 European Games.\nThe Stadium hosted all of Qarabag's Champions League group stage matches in the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League.\nThe stadium hosted the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final on 29 May 2019.\n\n\n=== Notable matches ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of football stadiums in Azerbaijan\nList of European stadiums by capacity\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

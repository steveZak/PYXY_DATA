        "wiki": "Casa Batll\u00f3 (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8kaz\u0259 \u03b2\u0259\u02c8\u028e\u02d0o]) is a building in the center of Barcelona. It was designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaud\u00ed and has been refurbished several times after that. Gaud\u00ed's assistants Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es i Gras, Josep Canaleta and Joan Rubi\u00f3 also contributed to the renovation project.\nThe local name for the building is Casa dels ossos (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality. It is located on the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia in the Eixample district, and forms part of a row of houses known as the Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia  (or Mansana de la Disc\u00f2rdia, the \"Block of Discord\"), which consists of four buildings by noted Modernista architects of Barcelona.Like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, Casa Batll\u00f3 is only identifiable as Modernisme or Art Nouveau in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, has unusual tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the fa\u00e7ade is decorated with a colorful mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles (trencad\u00eds). The roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of Saint George (patron saint of Catalonia, Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Initial construction (1877) ===\n\nThe building that is now Casa Batll\u00f3  was built in 1877, commissioned by Llu\u00eds Sala S\u00e1nchez. It was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the eclecticism traditional by the end of the 19th century. The building had a basement, a ground floor, four other floors and a garden in the back.\n\n\n=== Batll\u00f3 family ===\n\nThe house was bought by Josep Batll\u00f3 in 1900. The design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the Batll\u00f3 family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location. It is located in the middle of Passeig de Gracia, which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area. It was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves.In 1906 Josep Batll\u00f3 still owned the home. The Batll\u00f3 family was very well known in Barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city. Mr. Josep Batll\u00f3 I Casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city. Mr. Batll\u00f3 married Amalia Godo Belaunzaran, from the family that founded the newspaper La Vanguardia. Josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative. Both Josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit Gaud\u00ed. Josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the Batll\u00f3 family, such as Casa P\u00eda, built by the Josep Vilaseca. He chose the architect who had designed Park G\u00fcell because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan. The family lived on the Noble Floor of Casa Batll\u00f3 until the middle of the 1950s.\n\n\n=== Renovation (1904-1906) ===\n\nIn 1904 Josep Batll\u00f3 hired Gaud\u00ed to design his home; at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house. Gaud\u00ed convinced Josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year. The building was completed and refurbished in 1906. He completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the Batll\u00f3 family. He expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors. In the same year the Barcelona City Council selected the house as a candidate for that year's best building award. The award was given to another architect that year despite Gaud\u00ed's design.\n\n\n=== Refurbishments ===\nJosep Batll\u00f3 died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940 . After the death of the two parents, the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954. In 1954 an insurance company named Seguros Iberia acquired Casa Batll\u00f3 and set up offices there. In 1970, the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house. In 1983, the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior fa\u00e7ade was illuminated in the ceremony of La Merc\u00e8.\n\n\n=== Multiple uses ===\nIn 1993, the current owners of Casa Batll\u00f3 bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building. Two years later, in 1995, Casa Batll\u00f3 began to hire out its facilities for different events. More than 2,500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions. Due to the building's location and the beauty of the facilities being rented, the rooms of Casa Batll\u00f3 were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe local name for the building is Casa dels ossos (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality. The building looks very remarkable \u2014 like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, only identifiable as Modernisme or Art Nouveau in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.\nIt seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the fa\u00e7ade is decorated with a mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles (trencad\u00eds) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of Saint George (patron saint of Catalonia, Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n\n=== Loft ===\n\nThe loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty catenary arches that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal.  Some people believe that the \u201cribcage\u201d design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon's spine that is represented in the roof.\n\n\n=== Noble floor and museum ===\n\nThe noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes. On the noble floor, there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Mr. Batll\u00f3's study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like d\u00e9cor continues throughout the whole noble floor.\nIn 2002, the house opened its doors to the public, and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. The building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaud\u00ed. Casa Batll\u00f3 met with very much unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batll\u00f3, the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well. In 2005, Casa Batll\u00f3 became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n=== Roof ===\n\nThe roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design. Gaud\u00ed represents an animal's spine by using tiles of different colors on one side. The roof is decorated with four chimney stacks, that are designed to prevent backdraughts.\n\n\n=== Exterior fa\u00e7ade ===\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated. The lower ground floor with the main floor and two first-floor galleries are contained in a structure of Montju\u00efc sandstone with undulating lines. The central part, which reaches the last floor, is a multicolored section with protruding balconies. The top of the building is a crown, like a huge gable, which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks. This room is currently empty. The top displays a trim with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations.\n\nRoof tiles\nThe roof's arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales, and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye. Legend has it that it was once possible to see the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia through this window, which was being built simultaneously. The view of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is now blocked from this vantage point by newer buildings. The tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster, with the color grading from green on the right side, where the head begins, to deep blue and violet in the center, to red and pink on the left side of the building.\n\nTower and bulbOne of the highlights of the fa\u00e7ade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions. It is a bulbous, root-like structure that evokes plant life. There is a second bulb-shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower, which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering. The tower is decorated with monograms of Jesus (JHS), Maria (M with the ducal crown) and Joseph (JHP), made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the fa\u00e7ade. These symbols show the deep religiosity of Gaud\u00ed, who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica to choose the theme of the holy family.\nThe bulb was broken when it was delivered, perhaps during transportation. Although the manufacturer committed to re-do the broken parts, Gaud\u00ed liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring.\nCentral section\nThe central part of the fa\u00e7ade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies, reminiscent of Monet's Nymph\u00e9as, with gentle ripples and reflections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic. It is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with 330 rounds of polychrome pottery. The discs were designed by Gaud\u00ed and Jujol between tests during their stay in Majorca, while working on the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma.\nBalconyFinally, above the central part of the fa\u00e7ade is a smaller balcony, also iron, with a different exterior aesthetic, closer to a local type of lily. Two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture.\nMain floorThe fa\u00e7ade of the main floor, made entirely in sandstone, and is supported by two columns. The design is complemented by joinery windows set with multicolored stained glass. In front of the large windows, as if they were pillars that support the complex stone structure, there are six fine columns that seem to simulate the bones of a limb, with an apparent central articulation; in fact, this is a floral decoration. The rounded shapes of the gaps and the lip-like edges carved into the stone surrounding them create a semblance of a fully open mouth, for which the Casa Batll\u00f3 has been nicknamed the \"house of yawns\". The structure repeats on the first floor and in the design of two windows at the ends forming galleries, but on the large central window there are two balconies as described above.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Modernisme buildings in Barcelona\nConfidant from the Batll\u00f3 House\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial websiteCasa Batll\u00f3\nCasa Batll\u00f3 Store\nOfficial Virtual TourUnofficial websitesCasa Batll\u00f3 on GreatBuildings.com\nCasa Batll\u00f3 pictures\nCasa Batll\u00f3 description\nCasa Batllo at Gaudidesigner.com\nCasa Batllo at Tot Passejant (Spanish)",

          "From the minute you see the house, you can tell it was created by Gaudi. It was incredible. I am not usually even interested in extensive architecture, but this place was unreal! Each room had such a great story behind it. The only reason I marked it down a star was because I",

          "We had a free morning and decided to visit since this was super close to the apartment and the outside was so pretty. I am so glad we toured inside - this ended up being my favorite of all the Gaudi spots beating Park Guell and Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. I loved the audio tour and so did",

          "This house tour is not to be missed and worth every penny. We purchased tickets online standing outside approx \u20ac25 per person (with headset). Gaudi's architecture is well ahead of time, how something can be old yet modern at the same time begs belief. You will not be",

          "It was an amazing experience. The exterior of the house was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The inside of the house was different from what you usually see. The audio and visual guide was very explanatory. Definitely a must see!",
          "We visited the Casa Batllo after getting off the hop on, hop bus outside the building. We purchased the ticket at the gate and entered the building straight away and there were no queue at the time we visited. The audio guide was excellent and really helped around the building.",
          "It is a marvelous residential building with many interesting rooms and a beautiful rooftop. Book tickets in advance and walk on the roof to see the unique combination of colors used by Gaudi!",
          "Gaudi\u2019s creative architecture is extraordinary. His use of colorful mosaics is delightful throughout the staircase, and there are unique details everywhere in the building. Worth the price of admission!",
          "The entrance fee is just too expensive and the line to get in was horrendous. My opinion is admire the work of Gaudi on the exterior of that building, which was more enjoyable than be in an always crowded space inside.",
          "One of the architectural works of Gaudi that deserves to be enjoyed in detail, step by step, room by room, floor to floor.",
          "When traveling it is a must to walk by this beautiful building. I don't believe you will be disappointed. Plus there are fun little neighborhoods to explore.",
          "We had an audio/visual guide and paid 25\u20ac per person to get the tickets. Despite having the purchase the title and had an appointment, we still had to cue on the line like those without tickets. What's the point on purchasing the ticket online then? Despite this nonsense, the",
          "We booked tickets in advance online before we traveled. It was a very unexpected and unusual place! The outside is like nothing you have seen before and the tour of the inside is amazing too. A bit too expensive for what you get but a must see in my opinion. You would spend",
          "We liked it. Impressive Gaudi architecture. But even if it is a very spectacular building, we felt it is a bit overpriced. Expensive ticket for a relatively small building",
          "An excellent sight, we spent 1.5 hour to walk all over. The staff didn't help us much but it was ok . It could be less expensive.",
          "Casa Batllo is an architectural treasure, but you probably should pass on paying the exorbitant fee to visit the interior of this house. My wife and I paid the 25 euro each fee, buying tickets online in advance. This saved us 4 euro each to buy online and the price included an",
          "If you come to Barcelona, you must visit Antoni Gaudi's works of which Casa Batllo is one of them. We went during the day and there are already many tourists outside taking pictures of the unique front. I do recommend going back at night as it does look quite different and is",
          "I'm not arquittec but this building continues the style that we've been looking in our trip. Gaud\u00ed were a genius. Maybe, as usual, out of time with his designs, but the same happen with DaVincci, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and other, that their work was recognized after their",
          "Well worth a visit and would certainly recommend buying tickets as it does get busy. A wonderful work of architecture and the audio guide provides insight. An impressive building, inside and out.",
          "Casa Batllo was my favorite of all the Gaudi sites in Barcelona. The whole building is unique and imaginatively created. The colors, the architecture, even the neighborhood are phenomenal.",
          "Audio tour was great. I found this place interesting but not necessarily worth the cost. I think the exterior is more spectacular than the interior. However, if you like Gaudi and find his work interesting, you will probably appreciate it more than I.",
          "Amazing place. The virtual reality tour is great. They dont pack the place so you can enjoy the space. Take your time to view the building.",
          "We visited Cassa Batllo in January and there is no issue with getting tickets and walking right in. The building was amazing and they did a fantastic job with the audio guide. The device also serves as a virtual reality view of what the room looked like when furnished and",
          "To think of this as a mere house is too reductive. This is a true masterpiece and Gaud\u00ec is just a genius. there is note one door, or window, or wall, or brick that has a straigh line to it... just mindblowing.",
          "While the building itself is pretty, the tour is all virtual so the furniture and pieces were not actually there but a virtual simulation shown on a small phone they provide for the tour. The English audio guide also seemed lacking and found myself bored by the explanations in",
          "I really enjoyed this Gaudi tour, and like any of his works, what you see inside is hard to describe except it\u2019s definitely his and every design has a purpose. If you liked his other works you\u2019ll like this. It\u2019s that same style but different, of course. My only gripe is the",
          "We booked via the Julia bus tour-hop on/off. Really good value with the bus ticket plus 2 attractions included for 85 euros. I wasn't really sure if I would enjoy Gaudi's work but it is absolutely amazing. Highly recommended to see such colour, imagination, quality workmanship",
          "We were supposed to be on a tour to Girona and Figueres but terrible rain and winds caused the tour operator to cancel the trip, so instead we went to the Gaudi houses. We are very glad that we had the opportunity to go inside and fully learn about Casa Batlo. Seeing the curves",
          "Just the thought of someone being so avant garde, and having these ideas of aesthetics in the late XIX century and in the early XX century is astonishing. The man was simply a genius. The house itself is so detailed that you really need the Smart guide to appreciate the detalis.",
          "One cannot leave Barcelona without going to Casa Batllo, truly amazing. Gaud\u00ed was a genius and the average person really gets to see and feel his work. A true work of love and art. Go during the day but also go at night. If visiting during the summer and weekend go to a night",
          "What a privilege to be able to visit this place! It's absolutely awesome! Gaudi was undoubtedly a genius and to have one of his masterpieces (now a private residence) available to visit is just remarkable. Barcelona is full of such treasures but this one is just so completely",
          "I had seen the Casa Battlo from the outside multiple times, but visiting (silver ticket) was an addition beyond my expectations. When you are open to multi sensory experience and live architecture this will be well spend time and money.",
          "The queues went forever the day I visited so I lashed out on a Gold ticket, jumped the queue and after visiting the astonishingly beautiful building using the self tour headsets provided I had my photo taken from the top of the building, visited the fabulous Gaudi shop and then,",
          "Casa Batllo is a beautiful building created by Gaudi. The facade is stunning, the interior is even more breathtaking. I was really surprised to see all those fine detail it has in every corner of the house. It is not just a beautiful building, but a very functional and",
          "Absolutely loved this architectural masterpiece by Gaudi. The exterior looks stunning. Inside is even more beautiful. We got the basic tickets. Waiting line wasn\u2019t too bad. Moved very quickly. Be aware there is a lot walking and climbing stairs. And it was very crowded! Rooftop",
          "We did not go inside, but stopped to see it from the outside. It is absolutely incredible to see in-person. It is crazy that you walk up from the Metro and are suddenly standing in front of this exquisite work!",
          "The audio tour is interesting and informative with the AR. A tad expensive but Gaudi fans should go if you have time...",
          "The house is very special and a great place to visit for anyone who is a fan of art nouveau. One thing to keep in mind is that Casa Batllo is definitely overpriced as are most Gaudi experiences. As long as you understand this, the visit will be enjoyable. Our visit took place",
          "My son and I are photographers. There were so many interesting images that presented themselves to our view. What an imagination Gaudi had!",
          "What an amazing historical house! The architectural designs are well before their time. I enjoyed seeing the pictures of the house with its original inhabitants. I recommend buying your tickets ahead of time on-line and purchasing the old fashioned picture at the end. The",
          "We paid for Gold Tickets, but actually were no different special in normal days which is not crowded. I recommend to have picture in last floor in balcony which they offer and pay for it because it's good special for couple, friends and families.",
          "Once again Gaudi turns to nature to create the Batll\u00f2 house. Beautiful organic shape abound everywhere and even the light well is a thing of beauty. The audio guide is what makes this tour special as they use virtual reality so that you can see how each room would be furnished",
          "Excellent tour which is magnified with the use of Augmented Reality cell phone app that they provide. You can see what it was like in Gaudi's time",
          "Incredible building like Gaudi himself. January is good for visit because not crowd. The building and style are very unique. Audio guide is great with depicting furniture and scenes from the times when living in the home. The ticket price is too high like every ticket in",

          "Inside and outside, stunning architecture and design. Seems like there is a hidden surprise in every corner. We came early in the day. Short line and not a lot of people inside. Well worth it.",
          "100% worth seeing, do not miss this. Get your tickets in advance, skip the line and go right in! The audio tour and virtual tour are included in the basic ticket price and it is exceptional. It is interesting, easy to follow and gives a ton of info. I can\u2019t imagine walking",
          "The building is a true masterpiece - outstanding facade and unique interior. The two problems we had during the visit are: 1) The price for tickets is more expensive in person, which is not mentioned online on the page for ticket info. We could totally buy it online but we",
          "This house was just 100m from our hotel and it was a very windy rainy day so perfect for a visit. It was busy with a steady stream of people. To state the obvious the design, style, architecture and the building was very unique and way ahead of its time concerning the use of",
          "This is a very pretty and interesting building - we haven't toured inside, but the outside is lovely.",
          "We paid for our admission and audio guide at the Barcelona tourist info and were happy to get a 5:30 admission which allowed us to see the incredible rooftop in daylight as well as at night. There were beautiful views of Barcelona from up there in all directions. Inside we",
          "It was super interesting! The shapes, colors, all captivating! I would reccomend it to everyone! It was a nice experience.",
          "My one main problem with the attractions of this type in Barcelona are the high costs to go inside. My best advice is just look at it from the outside, you don't need to pay the money to go inside.",
          "This is a must see in Barcelona. Loved it! I actually enjoyed more than Casa Melia. The snow falling was a nice touch.",
          "Great building to look at. Have been in in the past but not on this trip, the entry price is ok for what\u2019s included. It wasn\u2019t busy when we visited so would have been a great time to go in",
          "Perhaps one of the less viewed Gaudi buildings, but well worth braving the crowds to get a close-up look at his genius for planning details on top of details. For instance, the color of the tiles in the central atrium changes from top to bottom to help evenly distribute the",
          "Beautiful house! It was so special to see it in person! 10/10 would recommend! The auditory guide was very informative!",
          "Empty house which you walk around in which they give you a phone you can stand in each room and look at the phone to see what it was like. The phone they give you doesnt work that well it's often showing you the room back to front. Good information given. Lots of little kids",
          "25 euros to enter an EMPTY house with no furnitures... looks like a scam actually... inside the architecture is really not amazing, nothing compared to the facade.... but the facade can be seen from outside for free so don't pay, it doesn't worth it at all.",
          "This was the highlight of my trip. I went to the Casa Batllo not knowing how to pronounce the name of it and a little in awe. I walked away knowing how to pronounce the name and still in awe. The early line access was great - recommend this. First through the doors on a",
          "What a beautiful building placed in the middle of busy shops. It is a must when in barcalona, just to see its beauty",
          "A must do while in Barcelona. Some of the most beautiful architecture in the city! The only downside was the slightly high prices.",
          "A very beautiful house and very interesting balconies in the shape of human scules . We didn't went inside because of the very expensive ticket",
          "We were not prepared for the awesomeness of this masterpiece. We want to go back in 6 years when it is finished. No hassle ticketing and entrance.",
          "There was room to move around in this house. The tour guide noted that during high-season everyone is falling over each other. This day it was snowing inside. The top of the \"casa\" offers a panoramic view of the city.",
          "We went on the night visit and it was truly amazing, extremely worth it. We drank a glass of wine while walking in the museum wearing flashlights on our heads and headphones everything was really interesting and the view from the rooftop was also really nice.",
          "Went here after visiting the Pederas, another Gaud\u00ec house. Wonderful and the audioguide was terrific, really brought the place alive. Don't waste your money on the extra Salas Moderne, not worth it, just another opportunity to take your photo, this time in period clothes. If",
          "Casa Batllo was probably my favorite part of visiting Barcelona. We booked directly through the Casa Batllo website and opted for the \u201cGold\u201d self guided tour for \u20ac35/each. When we arrived just before 10am there was already a bit of a queue going, but with the gold tour you",

          "On my last trip to Barcelona, I saw the exterior of Batllo, checked it off my list, and moved on. I missed out! This time, I took the tour. It's amazing! *Everything* is designed - the walls, the doors, the furniture, the windows. I have to say again - amazing. There is",

          "Loved it. You cannot miss it even when you do some shopping.Incredible architecture everyone have to see.",
          "This was a very well curated attraction. the house itself id without doubt an absolute gem and well worth a visit even if you are on a tight schedule. But the presentation of the house on the audio guide merits special praise. This is interesting, well timed and provides a",
          "Another Gaudi masterpiece. Its beautiful and different. We spent around 30 minutes. If accompanied with kids, it could get a bit boring. The neighborhood is lovely though.",
          "Great experience. Completely worth the time and money. So glad we didn\u2019t miss this or Casa Mila as part of our trip to Barcelona. Highly recommend! Purchasing tickets in advance was very helpful and saved us time and effort!",
          "Great place really worth the visit. It's so interesting to see all the work and imagination that's been out in.",
          "You can really see the genius of architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed in this house. All the details he thought of. All the different designs and even engineering aspects of the house. All in his head! Outstanding! If you appreciate architecture and art, and like modernism, you should",
          "I skipped the line, and was amongst the first viewers of the day. It is, of course the most wonderful building, and in many rooms I was one of just a few visitors. I have even taken a photograph of the front living area with its magnificent Windows without anyone else present.",
          "We bought the Gold ticket online to skip the queue due to our very limited time in Barcelona and it was worth it. You really skip the long queue! The whole tour was mesmerising! The audio worked very well and the sound was perfect. Loved the virtual experience on the audio",

          "Looks stunning and took some great pics outside. Didn\u2019t bother with buying tickets to go in as it\u2019s rather overpriced for what you actually see inside. However great photo opportunity outside with the facade the real star here.",
          "Because of the uncertain political conditions in Barcelona around the time of our visit, we hadn\u2019t purchased tickets to the two Gaudi-designed houses on Passeig de Gracia, and we had already seen long lines forming at Casa Batllo (remodeled by Gaudi 1904-1906) during our walks",
          "Worth going inside for a tour with their very well done audio guide. As someone who enjoys architecture this building was a fun experience and an impressive demonstration.",
          "I wouldn't deny Casa Batllo is a beautiful architecture, but it's certainly overpriced in two aspects: 1. compared with other sightseeings in Barcelona (can you believe tickets for Casa Batllo cost as much as La Sagrada Familia?) 2. compared with the living cost in Barcelona.",
          "Gaudi is a real genius architect who knew how to design buildings ergonomically and thought of sustainability way back in his time, while people in 21st century still need to gain a more awareness of sustainability. Despite all the crowds, you will eventually get to enjoy every",

          "Sadly we did not have enough time to go on the tour, and quite frankly I think it a bit overpriced, we did visit the outside of this Gaudi gem and just looking up at this awesome building was enough for us. We were lucky to arrive in the early AM in low season so there no",
          "I was really amazed! If you love art, Casa Batll\u00f3 is perfect. I was there in April 2019. I haven't bought the ticket before, the line was long, but it took only 30 minutes to buy the ticket.",
          "We purchased 4 tix and I assumed, wrongly, that they would allow us to bypass the long lines. We still, even with tickets in hand, had to wait in a line that stretched around the block. It doesn't make sense to buy the tickets ahead of time as the ticket buying line had no line!",
          "Colorful and lively designs all over the site. Amazed by the detailed artwork everywhere even the door knob.",
          "Very Nice... one of best ghaudi's works of art. You should visit while In Barcelona and make sure to book skip the line ticket",
          "They were, unfortunately, doing construction on the exterior when I visited, so that took away from the experience. However that aside the architecture here is just beautiful. If you have the money to spend, check it out! Some people kinda argued that it was cool, but not worth",
          "It is a beautiful architecture building but not friendly for children under 6. If you have a kid consider not visiting this place. There is no elevator, so no strollers, there is a lot of time to spend per room to really appreciate the architecture. The site is incredible.",
          "One of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona was this 2 hour self guided audio tour of this amazing Gaudi classic , Book ahead as like most of the premier sights this was very busy but we could walk past the large queue and up to the desk with no bother. The house itself is a",

          "It\u2019s quite impossible to do justice to Casa Battlo in a review - just go, marvel at Gaudi\u2019s genius, then go and see some of his other masterpieces. The tour is really well-organised and the audio-guides are excellent. Just remember to book tickets online - you automatically save",
          "I went in the off season, and early in the day so I had only a few people in the rooms with me at a time to take some great photos. It really has to be seen to be believed. Like a giant curving, undulating, underwater themed home, with a cool elevator, a center small interior",
          "Must see place in Barcelona! Bought the tickets on TripAdvisor as they were cheaper then at the ticket office at Casa Batll\u00f3 Really enjoyed the experience! The kids loved it too!",
          "We visited site on my birthday. Truly enjoyed the experience. Architecture inspired!. Very popular destination so lots of people to navigate but still worth a visit",
          "Very interesting architecture. Not something I would want to live in, but very interesting to tour. The ocean theme is prevalent, and the view from the roof is awesome.",
          "We visited this unique building with the special windows structure. It couldn't be fou elsewhere except Barcelona. It's worth paying a visit.",
          "Absolutely loved walking through this house! Stunning and you can\u2019t help but touch the walls and the wood. The snow feature in the middle of the house was so peaceful to watch, I could have stood there all day. The audio guide was also really interesting :D",
          "One more stunning creation by Gaudi, should not be missed at all. Advance online ticket purchase shall help in saving time and better time planning. Best time to visit is during the sundown.",
          "Very interesting to see how Gaudi lived and see things from his lens. 14 different stages. All put together nicely.",

          "Incredible experience the architecture was amazing and walking through the home and being able to see the furniture on the smartphone provided with information on how he lived and what he did in different rooms was amazing I\u2019m glad we got the chance to visit this and see the",
          "It's one of Barcelona's most popular places. It's different from all you know, so it's worth a visit. I don't know what's inside, and if it worth the money to go in, but from outside - it's very impressive.",
          "Really enjoyed over all experience, very well kept property, thanks to an owners who cares about art and making sure coming generations will be able to see it, with innovative and easy to use audio guide. You are experiencing it in your own phase with option to come back and",
          "I have never seen anything else comparable to this! It isn't only that Gaudi envisioned this, but that he was able to have it built according to his vision. The Smart Guide is also amazing--not only a narrative, but video overlays of what the home looked like when it was",
          "What a fantastic place, extremely interesting and informative, audio guide was excellent and interactive ans as for the building itself, it was the eye opener I expected fantastic value for money and one of the best places to visit in barcelona",
          "Wild, Seussian-like house designed by Gaudi in the heart of Barcelona. The craftsmanship and ingenuity is beautiful and inspiring. I recommend doing the 'early' admission (8:30) if you want some good pics without crowds. I would have liked to go back for the night moonlight",
          "This was amazing to see what a very clever man to design this house. The detail for everything is pure brilliance well worth a visit.",
          "You have to book well in advance because going there directly without ticket can be a real nightmare. it is a magical place that you have to visit in Barcelona. Gaudi was a genius!",
          "We went in first group in the morning (which started a little late) and still spent 2 hours walking the halls in this beautiful house. We became fans of Gaudi while on the trip.",
          "It is like walking into a fantasy. The place is magical enough from the outside. But walking into it is a different matter. Started from the main entrance you are already greeted by the most stunning curves and waves. My favorite is definitely the living room. One must really",
          "Very beautiful and strange at the same time. It really looks like something you would see in Disneyland. At night it lit up with lights to add to the ambiance. Cool stopz",
          "This house, Casa Mill\u00e1 & (later on) la Sagrada Familia are the best examples of the use of natural light by Gaud\u00ed ... astonishing !!!",
          "It seems our time in Barcelona became all about Gaudi, with this amazing place as the highlight! The color & light, design & grace of the very unique place seems such a stark contrast to the austere & simple life of the designer. This beautiful place truly is awe inspiring.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Gaudi was a genius! We used our Barcelona card. Traveling in December is great! There were no lines and we never had to wait for tables at restaurants.",
          "A very interesting place to visit and a visit to this town is incomplete without a tour inside. The Hop on/off bus entitles you to a discount if you have that and the gold pass though expensive is the way to see this place if you can afford it. The Gold pass lets you in on an",
          "This place belongs to god. It is totally a paradise!! One of the most famous architecture from Gaudi. You can\u2019t imagine how beautiful it is unless you see it. The glass with blue sunshine in inside the building. All the glories and inspiration of this building is something that",
          "We expected it to be amazing but we were BLOWN AWAY. The audio guide was incredible where you receive a mobile phone which \"adds\" furniture, etc into every room with all it's info. SO interesting and SO beautiful. Highly recommend it",
          "Very interesting building made by Gaudi. It's so different from what you usually see. I think anyone should experience it and maybe be inspired. The Virtual Guide was also really nice too :)",
          "Another must see in Barcelona we didn't go in as we were short on time however standing outside we were able to get some great photos",
          "This place gave us an extraordinery experience. Definitely worth to visit!! Very happy to start the day with such an experience :)",
          "Was a spontaneous stop on a short visit - so glad we took the time! Such imagination and creativity - unconstrained by convention.",
          "We had a lovely time at this place. My family and I truly enjoyed the architecture and the guided tour of the facility that was provided by a local guide.",
          "This place is astonishing. Even from outside it\u2019s unreal, but step inside and it\u2019s like no house you have ever seen. Never having seen Gaudi\u2019s work before, only pictures, we were surprised at how beautiful and well crafted everything is. The audio tour is very useful. The",
          "Again, it's more than just looking different. The electronic guide is brilliant but it will blow your mind at how all this worked way back when. It's not cheap, but you will not forget your visit.",
          "I liked this place from the first moment I bought the tickets. I've got an email from one of the managers with descriptions, plans, even with the list of the best restaurants around Casa Battlo. We visited this building at very rainy day but it was so romantic to look throw",
          "I liked it a lot, although the admission ticket is not cheap, yet it deserved every penny, gaudi is something",
          "We enjoyed to strol around Passeig de Gracia and have a look at Gaudis two campus Casas Batllo and Mila. Excellent spot to make nice pictures.",
          "A very unique and amazing experience. Worth your time and money. Everything inside is astonishing and the audio guide helps to understand the background details.",
          "Very interesting - informative and imaginative virtual tour around unbelievable house Gaudi's creation. Tour is worth money spent. You can take as much time as you want and explore Casa Batllo in your own pace.",
          "The Casa Batllo does not disappoint!! Right in the heart of Barcelona, doing this walking tour gives you a great perspective of the works of Gaudi!! from the views of the home from the street, to the views from the home of the street, and everything in between, you can feel this",
          "Got online tockets which helped to skip the line (in the end of November the line wasn't very huge but we saved definitely 30 minutes or more). The was audioguide included. And it's absolutely worth. You get lots of interesting information which helps to.understand this building",
          "Everyone should go visit it inside!! It' s huge and leaves you breathless! Just perfection - colours, forms and a great souvenir store, at the end of the tour!! A true Barcelona representative!!",
          "Amazing and unique architectural design which is one of the must see places in Madrid. It is walking distance to Placa de Catalunya and must see La Rambla!",
          "Well worth the price of admission, great views and photo opps. What a brilliant mind Gaudi had. He was truly a visionary.",
          "Riveting, mind-expanding, beautiful. Go at your own pace with the audio tour and be amazed by the modernist genius of Gaudi.",
          "An interesting house with nice design inside and outside. It takes around 2-3 hours to see the whole house. You get given headphones and a smartphone so that at certain spots of the house you get a VR experience showing what the house used to look like - it\u2019s very clever and",
          "Don't get me wrong- the building itself is beautiful. But it's just as amazing if you only look at the exterior of the building. We went last Wednesday with an early access ticket (8:30am entry) which is supposed to allow entry to the building 30 mins before the opening time",
          "We visited in November and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The colour and design are simply stunning. Worthy of visiting.",
          "One of the most wondrous piece of architecture I've ever visited. The tour was cleverly designed and gave increment value to the experience. The day was very rainy and we couldn't go to the roof, but the water drops behind the windows and the sound of the rain at the attic",
          "This is the quintessential Gaudi visit, so if you are coming to learn more and see the work of Gaudi in Barcelona, you must start here! Easy to find, easy to tour, flows pretty fast, and each room has the master's touch on it. Each work of his is different, so it's not \"seen one",
          "Amazing, of the most beautiful things I've seen in Barcelona, also with a good location near many shops for shopping",
          "This is a beautiful home and it is really unusual. I guarantee that you will not see another quite like it. The truly great part about Gaudi is everything is similar, but it is definitely a one off experience with each building. The tile work with all the curves is really",
          "Casa Batllo is another great specimen of Gaudi's outstanding architecture. A very unique building indeed.... you won't come across buildings like these very often. In first look, it doesn't look real rather a building from a comic / cartoon book. It's amazing that Gaudi",
          "Very lovely house, the entry ticket was a bit expensive but the virtual reality tour was pretty interesting, definitely a nice touch. Really great to see Gaudi's work, I would say for sure one of Gaudi's best houses in Barcelona. Not necesarily a must visit though if you are not",
          "This is one of Gaudi finest moments. What an incredibly beautiful place. The craftsmanship is beyond what words can say. The audio tour is definitely worth the money. The upkeep and renovations are solely funded by ticket sales. The audio tour was incredible as your device",
          "Its a must see building but I didnt go inside because you can do something else for that 25 euros. However you should visit both day and night so you can see it in daylight and with lights on",
          "It worth the visit and the money. Through the audio guide actually you can see how the house was before as it has got camera which is incredible. It is a bit expensive but generally Barcelona's sightseeings are expensive.",
          "You can tell so much thought and love went into this work of art. So much color and detail in the design. The audio tour really added to the experience and gave some depth to the story. I only wish I would have had time to take the night tour",
          "We loved Casa Batllo. The only issue with it is the crowds, so if you can plan your visit for the quietest time available during your trip, do it. The curving lines, creativity everywhere, unique design and decor are emblematic of an era. It's like walking into a Mucha poster,",
          "For the amount of money this cost, I really don't recommend going. I didn't study art or architecture... but I also really loved everything else Gaudi-focused in the city. But this fell flat for me and I regretted the money I spent 5 mins after entering. It may have been more",
          "This was a nice, concise audio tour of the Casa Batllo. The audio descriptions included just enough detail for my tastes, without droning on too long. We went early in the morning (10:30 am) before the crowds got too big, which was a plus. We passed by the site later in the",
          "Great visit. The best of all of the Gaudi houses to visit. Early Access was the best. Less crowds and more chances to take pictures. The audio and visual tour was great and informative.",
          "This was a really good tour, with a cool virtual reality hand-held device. The building is fairly large, and you get to see a lot of levels, plus the attic and roof. Plan for 1.5 hours, or more if it's crowded. We did the basic blue tour, which was fine in my opinion. It was not",
          "Casa Battlo is undoubtfully one of Gaudi's most interesting and beatiful works of art. With this said, the 25 euro paid for the entry still feel like a rip off when comparing to other museums entry fees, especially since the exterior is way more impressive and the house itself",
          "...architecturally speaking a real gem and the colors and the balconies and and and. Go early as it will be too crowded otherwise.",
          "Another place typical of Gaudi's work with a wonderful interior, The 3D tour was very interesting but again, even with a designated entry time the place was very full, although not so much that it reduced the enjoyment although this was January; possibly in high season it would",
          "This was the first Gaudi attraction my wife and I visited in Barcelona and it started the trip off well for us! The colours and shapes were all great, and we really enjoyed it. It was especially interesting at night with the way they had everything lit. Highly recommend it!",
          "Very nice Informative expensive though but when you visit you appreciate Gaudi\u2019s genius I don\u2019t believe there is a better expression of nature in a man made structure You should see it",
          "Definitely the best of the Gaudi houses strewn across Barcelona. The house evokes the feeling of being in an aquarium or under water as you go through the floors of the house. The best views are during the evening so you can time it such that you enter around 5PM and leave",
          "We'd loved this house architecture was incredible so different. Features you see no where else Gaudi had such unique ideas",
          "We visited in November with our teens and we were all captivated by the artistry. The audio tour was informative and fun. Highly recommend.",
          "My son and I had a great time at the Casa Batllo. We loved the architecture and the self-paced tour with the audio. I'd recommend going during the day so you can see everything lit with natural sunlight!",
          "Did the early morning tour of Gaudi\u2019s creation the Casa Batlo. It was amazingly beautiful and the early tour allowed us in the building an hour before it is open to the public. So worth it! There were only a few of us, maybe 20, so it was fantastic! The interactive audio visual",
          "I simply adore this building and I visit it everytime I come to Barcelona. Its so original and I never get bored of just looking up at it.",
          "Amazing design. We were too late to see the inside but the exterior is wonderful. Fun, friendly design rather than the typical urban design",
          "what a beautiful structure. both exterior as well as the interior is stunning. A must visit while in Barvelona. the audio guide enhances the experience.",
          "Lots to see. Several different levels including roof top. Audio guides are key for this visit. Make sure to purchase your entry online as it is significantly higher at the box office and there are lines. Make sure to go next door to Casa Amatller for warm melted chocolate with",
          "Once again a must see, beautiful, amazing colour and detailing. Walked straight in no queue. All the Gaudi buildings do have an entrance fee, in my opinion this one is worth it!",
          "This one is very hard to describe.... even when you see pictures on phamplets or pics on the website.. it just doesn't make any justice... completely beautiful...",
          "Another place full of history, architecture, art... I definitely turned into a big kid, this was one of my favourite places. Beautifully made, every detail is genius.",
          "We visited a bunch of Gaudi houses in Barcelona and this was by far our favorite. It was fun to visit in the evening. The interactive guide was fun and the audio guide gave us a good background of the house. The inside was super unique and interesting. Overall, really glad",
          "Do not miss this beautiful home! Every square foot is a wonder. So fun to imagine living there. I loved it so much I would love to go back some day.",
          "A unique architectural experience for young and old. Maintained immaculately but not a museum, a living environment. Great trip",
          "Visited here as our last stop on a three day break and it is well worth the effort. You can purchase three levels of entry, blue being the cheapest (and cheaper online) The only thing you gain by upgrading is a visit to one extra room, and a photo in vintage clothes, neither",
          "A very busy place but worth the visit. The rooms, stairways and roof area are something to see. We were on a tour and got in quickly. If you can buy tickets in advance, do so.",
          "This is a renovation that Gaudi did for a wealthy family. It is rumored to be in the design to resemble ST George's story of slaying the dragon . It's a unique place and worth the visit.the area around this home, is very rich , like 5th Ave in NYC. You will enjoy this",
          "Very simply, wow... this building shows the genius that Gaudi was. The carpentry, engineering and unique design were amazing to see.",
          "The outside, the inside and the terrace are just beautiful. The virtual reality that helps you see how certain rooms would have looked with the original furniture is really clever. I was blown away by every bit of the place - though I think our guide, Cristina Belenguer - made",
          "Weird and wonderful house with architectural details galore. We saw it only from the outside, but there was plenty to see.",
          "I booked the tickets online and paid a premium to enter the Casa at 8.30am to beat the crowd. When you enter the Casa you are handed SmartGuides that are a audio guide with a video feature that was very informative and well executed. The Casa is magical and well worth a visit.",
          "Over the course of three hours, our guide, Jelena (a practicing architect, writer, and professor of urban history at Barcelona Architecture Center), showed us an early Gaudi building (Casa Calvet, Carrer de Casp 48, 1898-1900), then took us to Gaudi's later buildings. From the",
          "This is a must see in Barcelona. The architecture is amazing, ecclectic and fun.The combination of tiles used is really a work of art. The furnitures are amazing. The rooftop is so much fun.I highly recommend this than Casa Mila.",
          "This building is typical of Gaudi\u2019s designs. The tour was with headphones and you meandered through the house at will. The sights are amazing because every where you looked you saw another special sight. This building is both beautiful inside and out. The lines can get long",
          "I was in Barcelona in 2008 but didn't go in; this time (June 2019) I did get a ticket and went into the house. It was amazing. Loved it and enjoyed the tech that went with the tour. Well worth it!",
          "When you visit, you understand how genius Gaudi was and how much in front of his time! A must see in Barcelona!",
          "Casa Batllo takes less than an hour to tour, and there is a line that forms daily outside. It\u2019s lovely when lit at night, but is also pretty during the day. Nearby a lot of shops at Passeig de Gracia if you need to do more than one thing in this area.",
          "I loved Casa Batll\u00f2 with its colours, shapes and furniture. The price is a bit expensive in my opinion but surely it worth it",
          "I didn't have time to go inside this one, but watched it from the outside. It was under restoration when I visited, but it still looked nice. I will try to visit this again on my next trip to Barcelona. Hopefully the restoration is done by then.",
          "Is a great experience and good place to see Gaudi artistic side and impressive mind views of architecture and style. I found it a bit empty as there are no furniture inside and this might have improved the quality of the house.",
          "Very interesting and amusing architecture. Unique and eye opening. Thrilled and stunned by the master piece of A. Gaudi!",
          "If you love Gaudi this is a great example of his creative genius. If you had to choose one of his sights to see I would put the Basilica Familia first but this is certainly a close second.",
          "We were really impressed with this building it is definitely worth a visit. We bought an advanced ticket as we were unsure how busy it would be, being a Saturday but we found it not too crowded for entry or to look around. The staff were very helpful and there is a large shop",
          "We had a short time in Barcelona and saw Gaudi on the map but it was different Gaudi at different location. We only see the external building and not going inside. There was a massive queue as I hadn't booked any ticket for this. The building itself was very attractive to look",
          "Overwhelmed by Gaudi's vision and execution. A feast of color and architectural genius. One more reason why Spain(and Barcelona)should be on any world travelers list. I've been to Italy twice, and although it's my heritage, and would love to go back, so happy I picked Spain this",
          "Casa Battl\u00f3 is one of Antoni Gaudi's masterpieces and it was a \"must see\" for my husband and I.  While tickets range in price from \u20ac25 to \u20ac35 (and more for different \"experiences\"), we chose the \u20ac25 \"blue\" ticket as the best value for us. To avoid paying the extra \u20ac4 fee",
          "The locals thought Gaudi was crazy when he designed this building. It definitely is unique, both inside and out. It's interesting to see but I would recommend getting tickets online in advance. Go early in the day before the lines get too long and the rooms get too crowded.",
          "Very unique. I think the tour is a bit overpriced, but the home is really a work of art. Lots of stairs. Go early or it gets too crowded.",
          "Imagine taking a basically box apartment and transforming it into the Casa Batll\u00f3! Gaudi was a genius. It is like touring an organically grown house, or something from the Hobbit Shire, or just something out of this world. The feel of the handrails, chairs, knobs are so",
          "This is a beautiful piece of architecture by Gaudi. It is well worth the 17EU to get in! I was at first just happy to see it from the outside but it was great to go in. I recommend buying tickets for anything like this in advanced as they are cheaper online.",
          "It was the best tour for me. I was able to enjoy sightseeing because it is friendly for Deaf American to follow the tour easily. Highly recommended for Deaf travelers!",
          "My wife and I first saw the house in the morning as were walking along Paseo de Gracia. But when we saw it at night, it looked liked a different building. The lights highlighted the curves of the house, it was more beautiful at night with the lighting from within the house.",
          "One of the most amazing pieces of architecture I've ever seen. The queue was long but was going quickly. Price was acceptable, considering the amazing building. Will return!",
          "You will really like the entire tour with audio guide , and if you understand something about architecture you will enjoy it to the core, Gaudi is brilliant and especially artistic in the entire construction In this tour they will offer a photo in retro theme and there is",
          "This was one of Gaudi\u2019s amazing home he built and it is stunning. As recommended in Trip Advisor we went in the afternoon when the lines were reasonable. The amazing architecture is like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen. It was steep so we didn\u2019t go to the top but definitely worth",
          "One of the hallmark structures by Barcelona's most celebrated architect, the Casa Batllo is certainly beautiful to see but being an urban residence, it was not built to accommodate the hordes of tourists that now stalk its halls. The Casa does do timed tickets as a way to",
          "There are no words to express the magnificence of this fantastic work of art. It is a awe inspiring piece of architecture. You can not describe with words the absolute beauty and majestuosity of this place. He was a GENIUS!!!!",
          "I loved this tour. You really got to see a glimpse in the mind of Gaud\u00ed. His thought process was so amazing and inspiring. He was really a genius. This apartment is beautiful and colorful. You get an iPhone type guide and it shows what the room looks like with furniture.",
          "We paid extra for the early entry. This did mean when we were on the roof there were not many people and we had time to enjoy the magic of the building. I especially liked the light wells. The tile colours moving like the sea. The comentary was easy to understand and gave alot",
          "Very special audio/AR guide. The positional video on the device gave a different, funny and fuller experience of the houses original purpose and decoration.",
          "I loved this quirky house six years ago and last week I was eager to show it to my friend. I was amazed to find the tour was even better thanks to the amazing technology of the headsets. Now as you walk into the rooms you point the screens to the walls and they become full with",
          "We enjoyed the time spent in this building. The ticket is quite pricey but it is worth. The AR app is fascinating and unique it shows how the house looked like in the time of family Batll\u00f3. The shapes, the colors are amazing. We spent here about 2 hours.",
          "Casa Battle is amazing from the outside and even more amazing inside. We had a private tour so we had all our questions answered and toured all the rooms, including the roof. Great pix. A definite Gaudi experience.",
          "We did the 9:15 tour and I would definitely recommend going as early as possible. The house was fascinating and the audio set made touring much more enjoyable. When we left, about an hour later it was much more crowded.",
          "if you have any interest in Architecture as an art form, this tour is for you, the deep thought and attention to detail by Gaudi are astounding. Amazing quality of craftsmanship, materials and construction for somethig built so long ago.",
          "Excellent tour and only takes an hour or so. Close to Sagrada Familia also. Interesting house that every architecture student should visit!",
          "We were passing around when we spotted this beautiful building. We found that we can go inside and check it out, however, I found the admission a bit expensive. On top of that, I didn`t want the hassle with young kids waiting in the queue. It looks really amazing outside and it",
          "Just incredible, from the architecture of the rooms inside to the spectacular roof sculptures. The electronic tour is great.",
          "A wonderful Gaudi building inside and out. It is amazing to think that this was someone's home. We had timed tickets for a 9.30 entry and although we arrived about 10mins beforehand we were allowed to enter straight away with no waiting in line. We were given the audio guide",
          "Really worth visiting Casa Batlo\u2019. All the family appreciated it. Adults, young boys and my teenager daughter. Very well organized with individual audio. You cannot miss it if you are in Barcelona.",
          "I have been to quite a few Gaudi buildings including a couple close to this one so I had to pop in this time I was I Barcelona. The building is filled with all the usual Gaudi design features and it really is a work of art The ticket price includes an audio guide which features",
          "We love this place. We have lived in Barcelona for 4 years and we love comming here for the architecture and view from the roof.",
          "The exterior is lovely. The interior was interesting. Though this was more like a one time thing for us.",
          "This was really terrific. The audio tour is plenty good, and self paced. You cannot get a true sense of this place without a tour. Outside view is just not going to cut it.",
          "We toured many Gaudi locations while in Madrid, but the Gaudi Casa Batllo was by far our favorite. We loved the guide & tour.",
          "My wife and I visited Casa Batllo and were not disappointed. My wife studied interior design and was amazed on the architecture of the home",
          "I absolutely adore Casa Batllo. This house was built in 1877 but was renovated between 1906 - 1906. The designer, of course, was Gaudi and this is now one of the UNESCO World Heritages. When I first saw the building, its exterior facade had completely drawn my 100% attention.",
          "We have bought gold ticket (skip the line,audio guide and one picture included).Casa Battlo is unbelievable building and it is must when you are in Barcelona.We really enjoyed it despite it was crowded.We have entrance at 10.30 so maybe it is better to buy for earlier time.",
          "Fantastic tour especially for fans of Gaudi. This tour helps to understand more about the man and his life/artistic influences. The virtual camera was also very useful. We were able to walk up and get tickets to enter straight away without prebooking but then again we were not",
          "The artist Gaudi used all of his techniques in this house/tourist attraction. Tiny staircases with many stairs and many floors. There is a tiny elevator but you must ask for it. Gift shope highly overpriced but full of beautiful things.",
          "Visited in 2017 and 2018 - am fascinated with the unusual architecture, captivated by the colours and not so hot with all that climbing up & down! The view from the roof is a bit limited from the front facing - but otherwise, it's a good view and interesting roof structure.",
          "This is what dreams are made of. Especially if you like elements of the sea and ocean. Feels like living in an big aquarium. Surprising to note that this is privately owned. The conservation work is beautiful and meticulous. Audio tour includes a highly enjoyable interpretive",
          "Wonderful home exhibiting the genius of Gaudi. The video tour they give you makes it a fabulous experience. Well woththe time and money. We saw this before Sagrada Familia and it enhanced our understanding and appreciation of Gaudi.",
          "We didn\u2019t actually go inside the building, but it\u2019s worth a walk past if nothing else to see Gaudi\u2019s quirky architecture!",
          "Casa Batll\u00f3 was one of my favorite memories of Barcelona. I saw pics and wanted to go here before I arrived. I was so excited that it was within close walking distance to my hotel. I was able to view it several times both in the daytime and lit up at night. I even went to say",
          "We decided to take a Gaudi tour in Barcelona. I did not know anything about Gaudi and was absolutely blown away by his creativity, designs and genius of his architecture. I became an immediate fan. Casa Batllo was the first stop on our tour and we had an early access ticket.",
          "An amazing building which is a must see! purchase tickets online before you go as they dont sell at the door.",
          "We didn't plan on this tour but decided to do it after doing Sagrada Familia. We booked the VIP tour as the queues to get in were so long. I suggest you buy your access online, in advance as the wait can get frustrating. The smart guide was good, offering alternate views of",
          "this was well worth every penny! the early access enable the house to be viewed with very few people enabling some fantastic photos and a more enjoyable experience. at times there was only my husband and myself in the room! beautiful building, a true work of art. the audio guide",
          "I give this a 4 only because it is so expensive and I do realize they say it\u2019s to pay for the restoration and upkeep. But 29 euros for the basic ticket is a lot even with the best audio tour which shows you what the rooms would have looked like furnished. The place is amazing",
          "The Casa Batllo tour wasn\u2019t on my list until after Park Guell. So happy I booked this tour! I recommend the Gold option, as for a few euros extra you get to skip the line and walk right in. Easily my favorite tour (besides La Sagrada) and I was able to get tickets the night",
          "You didnt see Art until you see Gaudi\u2019s work! One of the most amazing places and architecture you must add to your list!!",
          "As with all Gaudi architecture, a joy to view and see his amazing innovative talent. Beautiful. It was worth paying a little extra to view the rooms before there are too many people.",
          "We visited all available Gaudi buildings and places with each more spectacular than the one before or next...YES, as impossible as what you will see.",
          "Really great to know the architecture of Gaud\u00ed. Just the right amount of details with the audio guide. You get on top some augmented reality which is more a Gadget but well, they want to be cool. Definitely worth visiting",
          "I am constantly amazed by Gaudi's works, and his vision of the natural world, and how his work was guided by nature. This house is a lovely work of art and definitely a must visit. Buy tickets in advance!",
          "Talk about a crazy house! Yes, but if you take the tour and really get into the design work that went into this place, I think you'll have a good appreciation for the amount of work and talent that went into making this.",
          "Architectural masterpiece. It is highly recommended for people who are interested of architecture, art, innovation, creativity to enter the building and not settle for outside viewing. The audio tutorial is fascinating. One of the must-see places in Barcelona.",
          "The interior of Casa Battlo is fascinating. The way in which Gaud\u00ed uses colour, light and shape are very impressive. The front facade is very eye catching and unusual. The rooftop is distinctive but not as large as Casa Mila. It\u2019s not cheap but it is worth a visit, although we",
          "Not what was expected when signed up for tour, however amazed surprised at the vision of Gaudi and his architecture, beautiful and functional.",
          "This house is a magnificent example of Gaudi\u2019s extraordinary architecture and design but it\u2019s so packed with visitors, it\u2019s hard to see everything hidden in the detail. The gift shop is on the expensive side and you can find better prices at other Gaudi sites.",
          "nice stuff and a real nice place especially for kids the exterior its amazing but inside its not such a big deal to see and the ticket its a little expensive for one person only 30 euros....but in the end was fine and nice to discover other culture and to see the history of",
          "Less hectic than the Sagrada Familia, this is the perfect example of Gaudis vision. A wonderful view of the city awaits you once you get to the roof terrace.",
          "Excellent visit. The hills and stairs rd s were challenging given our age, ut worth it. Gaudi was an imaginative and divers talent.",
          "This was a highlight for me! I felt that being in Casa Batlo gave me a true inside view into Gaudi's sensibility as an architect and artist. I could go back numerous times and absorb some new piece or perspective.",
          "We booked a tour that included Casa Batllo, Park Guell and La Sagrada. I definitely was concerned when we arrived because the young lady that was checking people in did not have a clue as to what she was doing. I was so happy when she put us into groups and we had Oliver as",
          "I loved it! This house is amazing! I bought the Golden ticket to see the Sal\u00f3 Modernista and I didn't regret it was gorgeous I could have stayed there for hours!",
          "A visit here is a \u2018must\u2019 when visiting Barcelona. Slightly disappointed that the rooms did not have furniture (just the one \u2018private\u2019 room), and it was expensive for the entry price.",
          "Highly recommend this attraction. You\u2019ll discover the amazing design by Gaudi. Buy your tickets early to avoid lining up.",
          "this is one of the most famous houses done by architect Gaudi; the outside mosaic is just stunning; make sure to see also all the other houses and master pieces as the Parque Guell",
          "Casa Batllo is a stunning and beautiful house. Is hard to know how Gaudi could built such an amazing home. Very highly recommended.",
          "We bought the gold pass tickets which gave us fast track entry to Casa Batll\u00f3, entry to the furnished private hall as well as the main house and a small souvenir bottle of water.

          "Excellent layout. Get there early. Compare the Gaud\u00ed addition to the other houses nearby. Very interesting.",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful house to learn, imagine, and immerse yourself in the world and mind of Gaudi. Truly educational and enjoyable with the help of the audio guide of course.",
          "My husband and I had a fabulous experience at Casa Batllo. We purchased advance tickets to Magic Nights, which allows you to tour the house for an hour with a cool augmented reality (smart phone and audio guide) experience. The second hour is a rooftop concert and two",
          "A must see for Barcelona. Very good, clear audio guide and complete coverage of the house from top to bottom. Just so stunning right to the very top - roof!",
          "Other than the Sagrada Familia, this is my favorite of Gaudi's. It shows his genius and real sense of making art functional. And in fact making the functional into art. I loved the louvered windows for ventilation, the door knob molded off of his hands. And my favorite was",
          "It is a building, typical of Gaudi's architecture, with connotations of water, sea and oceans. The overall visit does not take more than an hour. It is a privately held attraction, maybe it is for this that is it so expensive. I think a ticket of 15 Euro would be more than",
          "This was a wonderful experience even before we got to the casa. So much information is sent via email to make your visit enjoyable and a success. The information and augmented reality of the tour is incredible. We had general admission tickets for first time slot and it wasn't",
          "This building looks amazing from the outside. All of the architecture by Gaudi in Barcelona looked amazing. I wish we would\u2019ve had more time in Barcelona to see the inside.",
          "Explore every corner of Casa Batlio with the simulated audio guide. Loved how beautiful is this works of art by Gaudi where he really released all his imagination and creativity. A must visit when in Barcelona.",
          "The audio guide providing simulated furnished zones was helpful. Found that the interior needed refurbishment badly. They were doing restoration works in the dining hall, and this was closed off. Please take your time to admire and appreciate every corner of the Casa. I",
          "I\u2019m not really into art much. But this house was neat and entertaining even for me. Really imaginative. Cool colors and lighting. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "To fully understand the genius of Gaudi's designs, you need to visit Casa Batllo. The admission with audio guide is steep, but well worth it. They have clearly redefined the audio guide concept by adding virtual reality that helps you visualize the building's features. And the",
          "Exhausted, I made sure I got there. Sorry couldn\u2019t go back to see it at night must be splendid. Day time viewing just as magical. I did not go inside, I don\u2019t like crowds of people.",
          "We had the pleasure of visiting Casa Batllo in September 2019. During the tour you are guided by an interesting audio/ visual guide that provided background information on Gaudi as well as the building. The entire design of the building is made to seem like you are under",
          "Yet another creation of Goudi in creating a Casa truly befitting the might and powerful. The exquisite inside work shows how much details is looked into in designing and construction of this building",
          "it was a fantastic and unforgettable experience. I love the beautiful decorations and considerate designs in every detail. you can leave your words in a notebook~",
          "The building was intriguing. And a must if you are a Gaudi fan. Definitely unlike any building you have ever seen. If you are in Barcelona, you should visit at least one of the famous Gaudi Casa\u2019s, and I chose this. I coincided my visit with the magic night concert at the",
          "Wow. What a beautiful building. Typical Gaudi. Quite pricey to visit inside. Lovely just to look at.",
          "Visited several Gaudi sites on the trip, and this was favorite one: fabulous example of his work and influence on the architecture at large. Audio guide with augmented reality was also pretty cool and I would recommend it.",
          "Just see it! The wait was long and exhausting and we never made it inside but we hear its amazing. From the outside, it looks great!",
          "Gaudi was a genius, and this is one of the houses he renovated in Barcelona. Take the tour, and you will evidence of his genius in the light, color, design and details of this phenomenal structure. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona.",
          "We chose the option to pay a bit extra and gain entry early at 8.30 before the 9am opening time and we were very glad we did. We then had the opportunity to explore this beautiful building and take photos without having to compete with the crowds who come later on. They also",
          "Casa Batllo is worth visiting. I was so amazed by the audio guide, it is very engaging and informative. It was actually the first time that I enjoyed audio guide. The Casa really showed how gifted Gaudi is. We even upgraded our ticket to Gold because we cant get enough of it.",
          "The house is amazing and the 3D guide tour is fine. You pay to rent the equipment...I had the VIP pass and the Lady at the entrance didn't even check my ticket and asked me to wait outside, so I waited 10 minutes and tried again as I saw people inside, she said it wasn't open",
          "One of the many beautiful buildings by Gaudi represented throughout Barcelona. We visited at night and the lighting really highlights the building.",
          "We walked up from the metro on the way to our hotel and tripped over Casa Batilio. Fabulous building and so much detail to feast your eyes on.",
          "I did the early-bird tour of Casa Batll\u00f3, allowing me to see this amazing property, including the mosaic-laden dragon rooftop, before the crowds hit. If you are a Gaudi fan, you will enjoy this site. The tour lets you see all of the good stuff, including the back patio and the",
          "I wasn't planning to buy the ticket to go inside the house since it is a bit expensive, but I decided that I would on a whim, and I was so glad I did. It was easily the highlight of my trip as I was guided through the interior with he audio guide, which allowed me to learn about",
          "Get there early in the day - like 7am - if you want to bet the lines. But the best outside view is at night. When this place is lit up it's breath taking!!",
          "Having never come across much of Gaudi\u2019s work, I can say I\u2019m a convert; what a fantastically vivid way he had of expressing himself through art. A little pricy but slightly cheaper tickets on the internet than on the door.",
          "Amazing piece of architecture, very interesting, great interactive smart guide. Well worth a visit. Great items in the shop too, very easy to spend quite a bit of money! Easy entrance with mobile tickets booked in advance.",
          "The quality of the design and craftsmanship is exquisite. You'd expect nothing less from Gaudi, absolute genius!",
          "Loved touring one of Gaudi's houses that is not the Sagrada Familia. A different detour - but nonetheless still fun, captivating, and artsy.",
          "My fourth time in Barcelona and I\u2019ve only just done this. I loved it. The Gaudi architecture is fabulous. I found the handheld guide really easy to use. I also managed to buy a ticket online just an hour before I wanted to visit which made the entrance process quick and easy.",
          "Don't miss this architectural monument by Gaudi! There is nothing else like it! From one of the greatest world architects!",
          "Great place to visit. Definitely worth avoiding the queue and booking in advance which is very simple to do. We chose to have the smart guide with augmented reality visuals so you can see the crazy inner thoughts of how Gaudi imagined this place to be. The whole tour takes about",
          "Love the tranquility... Was amazed with the variety on display .. Love to go back and take a slow walk ...",
          "Really surprised this was rated so highly. Would not recommend waiting in The long line or spending 25 euros to enter. Come by and take a picture of the neat outside exterior and keep on going about the rest of your day. Not sure why the admission is so steep here. I was",
          "It's hard to describe the sensory experience of Gaudi's painstaking work. The photos once he's before visiting do not do it justice. It is a whole body experience. Worth the trip to Barcelona for this alone.",
          "The long was too long when we got there but the outside of the building is amazing. This building is amazing architecture. Another thumbs up for Gaudi",
          "I highly recommend the early bird ticket. Get to see Casa Battlo without all the queues. Just you and maybe 15 or so others who have bothered to get up early. Head straight to the roof to get the sunrise photos without anyone spoiling your shot. The complimentary audio guide is",
          "We fitted our visit to Casa Batllo in on our last morning in Barcelona. It was an after thought. We were so pleased we did as it was an absolute delight to be inside this exquisite Gaudi designed building. The audio guide was excellent. We got there just after nine in the",
          "I chose this one among all the casa that Gaudi built and the audio guide was so helpful that you can visualize the times when all furnitures are there. Worth seeing!",
          "While it is pricey, we opted for the gold ticket pass and waltzed in without waiting in line. The audio tour that allows you to simulate Gaudis vision was very cool! We also got to have access to a special room and took a photo feeling like we were travelling back in time to",
          "This place will amaze you and confuse you! It is nothing like you have ever seen before! People wonder whether Gaudi was a genius or crazy! I think he was both! The results are incredible! He doesn't think outside the box for he has no box! I think he was a crazy genius and he",
          "We had a 9am entry ticket and waited only about 10 minutes to enter this incredible house. I do recommend an early entry, as the light is excellent and there are fewer people. During those 10 minutes, we admired the outside and watched the helpful video that was emailed in",
          "We are interior design enthusiasts so this was number one on our list and let me tell you it did not disappoint! Definitely go and be ready to be amazed not only by the beauty of Gaudi\u2019s style but particularly by the genius behind everything he made!",
          "Absolutely fascinating! Even if you don\u2019t purchase tickets ahead the line moves fast at this time of year. It takes at lest an hour and a half to see everything. The gift shop is full of Gaudi merchandise but good quality.",
          "A wonderful place to visit. Having the audio guide was a must. When you listened and looked, everything became logical, e.g. the difference in the width of the windows, the ventilation system.",
          "I booked the Gold package. I arrived earlier than my time slot, and was allowed to go in straight away. The headphones did not work very well. The vintage portrait was nice, but I did not have my ticket checked. The modernist Hall was not worth paying extra for. The",
          "We were on the Hop on Hop of bus and we were told to look out for this building on our tour. Lucky for us the bus stopped at this location so we could get off and have a look at the design and take photo's along with the rest of the visitors to this area. The design work on the",
          "We bought the gold ticket to bypass the lines and was able to enter right at our time of 10:30a. Well run self-guided tour with clear postings of audio guide stops. Gaudi's attention to detail was amazing (window knobs designed to match a user's hand, venting systems, etc.).",
          "There's no doubt about it, Casa Battlo is worth a visit. The building is just as amazing as the hype and photos suggest. We arrived about 10 minutes before our booked-months-in-advance timed ticket indicated, waited in a long line and were through the entrance doors almost",
          "I loved this and thought the augmented reality guide was fantastic. It was the first time I had visited any Gaudi property and it was so good. I would highly recommend this and thought it showed Barcelona off well from the top.",
          "If you can ignore & cope with the masses of tourists throughout your visit, really a must do attraction while in Barcelona. Highly recommend the gold pass access, worth just for the queue jump, but also quite peacefully journey into the saloon, and fun vintage photo souvenir,",
          "This is clearly a popular place and I assumed that since there was a timed entry, perhaps it would have been more reasonable number of people at any given time. That was not the case at all. The site itself is quite amazing, but it was just not very fun given the crowd size.",
          "Self guided tour of this beautiful attraction. Informative and well done narrative. Purchasing tickets prior to arrival was perfect.",
          "Timed tickets are great but don't be fooled the place is always busy and the signs inside the building aren't that easy to follow. It is almost impossible to get close to the roof to capture its edge with all the selfie takers. Really? You honestly need 20 different selfie",
          "We liked very much the unusual architecture and the solutions. I studied architecture in college and always wanted to see Gaudi's work up close. This building was very representative - liked it much!",
          "I like the VR and audio guide very much. we can spend the time as long as we like, to take photo, on each floor and back yard, on the roof too. Gaudi's design is ever lasting !",
          "This house is amazing the genius Gaudi had when he build it, He was way ahead of his time putting ideas in this house we still use today, vents in doors and walls using windows for excellent lighting, you feel like its a house of the future. Be sure to get skip the line tickets",
          "We loved Casa Batilo, having visited two years ago on our own, and recently with a guide from\u201dWalks.\u201d Beautifully executed, and loaded with creativity.",
          "This house is where the magic is made:) wonderful based house, all regards goes to Gaudi! I loved it, the colors, the whole architecture of it .... loved it",
          "Along with Casa Mila, Casa Batllo is a Gaudi masterpiece in the l'Eixample neighborhood. The tour includes the rooftop, attic and apartments and it's well worth the price. The VR and audio guides are great too. If you want to see a couple of additional rooms and get your picture",
          "Definitley worth visiting this, fascinating to imagine living here when it was a home and an absolute triumph in design and execution.",
          "Another magical spot in Barcelona is definitely worth a stop to see the outside of this building. My friend and I paid to do the inside tour which was fine but if you\u2019re not really interested in Gaudi or his works then you could probably pass on going indoors and just get your",
          "A really peculiar house. There are many theories of what Gaudi was thinking when he made it but he never said anything about it. You should see it at night!",
          "Fantastic not to be missed Casa Batllo. The outside is amazing and with the audio guide for the inside it's a real treat. Why would you miss it? A great experience for Gaudi lovers of which I am one. He is brilliant and is the reason I came to Barcelona. Not to be missed are La",
          "Goudi wanted a house to replicate the sea....how would you ever do that? He did. Go inside. It's amazing.",
          "No question Gaudi was a genius and when you visit this house designed by him you understand why. Every little detail is something he thought of. Well worth the time and money when you visit Barcelona. Note: well worth to order tickets online. Saves times in line and ensure your",
          "We visited at 2 o clock on a Monday in October and didn't have to queue at all. The admission price is steep, but it includes a very good audio visual guide and there is a huge amount to see. I probably don't need to say that it's beautiful inside and out, and the design work is",
          "Awesome place to see, very beautiful and inviting. No signs to \u2018 do not touch\u2019 book online as cheaper, still queue but you can choose time. Also see Other Gaudi places in Barcelona easily.",
          "The architecture of the building, the indescribably beautiful rooftop is a must see in Barcelona. Highly recommend the audio guide which is the best I have ever used (it knows where you are in the building). If you stay in some hotels, you get a free admission (Le Meridien is",
          "Very interesting architecture, must do in Barcelona. I didn't buy tickets in advance and the queue wasn't too long either but could have saved a few euros with online ticket. Very picturesque building, beautiful design by Gaudi that made me fall in love with his works.",
          "It does cost a few Euro's to get in but well worth the entry fee. It is obvious that Gaudi was way ahead of his time, the way he used the local woods and free formed tile mosaics, etc. He does everything except straight square walls like back home. What a fantastic place to",
          "Crazy and a genius is what we discovered about Gaudi!!! Nothing like his work anywhere in the world. A must see tour!!!!",
          "Loved the audio/visual guide. Super cool. We walked straight in with the 'gold' ticket access. Wasn't too busy in late September either.",
          "This is an incredible work of architecture. The smart guide is very well done. It has a virtual reality feature which allows you to experience the house in its original glory. Great value for money.",
          "I feel torn on how to rate the experience. The Casa Batllo is a \u201cmust see\u201d for fans of Gaudi\u2019s architecture, BUT the experience is almost ruined by the crowds of people who are in the house at the same time. As one example, imagine a narrow, winding staircase, choked with",
          "Me and my husband when in the morning as they open and also join the rooftop night party, we are very thankful to see both the day and night of Casa Batllo, the atmosphere is very different and the rooftop performances is very good for the night party and they also included two",
          "Casa Battlo is a beautiful house built for the Battlo family by Gaud\u00ed. It is based on the legend of St George who slayed a Dragon to save a Princess. The outside of the house resembles bones representing the people slayed by the dragon, and the dragons back with scales(small",
          "We thought about booking ahead as it\u2019s cheaper to book online but we happened to be passing early one morning and there was no queue - around 9.30 - so paid and went in. It\u2019s beautiful, unique and we were glad we did it when we did. Few tourists taking repeat selfies in front of",
          "Most people say the opposite -- that casa Mila is the better of the tell, but I disagree. I loved all the colors in this one and we had access to almost every floor of the house. The guided VR tour was awesome because you could more easily see Gaudi's inspiration from nature.",
          "Excellent value for money. Audio guide device shows virtual reality of each room you visit and the audio is informative and interesting. Pay the ticket price and go and see this marvellous house.",
          "In the middle of town. Shop till you drop. And then you stumble across this beauty. The architecture ALL around Barcelona is absolutely amazing. Everywhere your look you feel the need to pick up a camera. Already making arrangements to fly back in a few months.",
          "This private home designed by Gaudi to mimic the sea is stunning. The audio guide was helpful, and showed how the rooms looked when they were furnished. I have no way of knowing if there is a good time of day to visit. We went at noon, and alas, like everything, everywhere,",
          "Very cool! Got admission included as part of Barcelona Pass. While Sagrada is a big masterpiece, Battlo is a very cool way to get up close and personal to Gaudi's unique style. Recommended to go about 15 mins before they open. That way you can be one of the first in and have the",
          "We went on a Wed, skipped the line and leisurely walked through this amazing house like we lived there. No crowds great pics. So worth it.",
          "This house is another example of Gaudi's exceptional talent. The way he used tiles and natural light made him an extraordinary architect/artist.",
          "I was told by a Barcelona citizen this is a must see. I would agree. Buy your ticket online to save some money and get the audio guide. Without it you won\u2019t get to learn the amazing history. It\u2019s so pretty inside and the view of the roof at night was amazing. Definitely",
          "This is really nice, on the corner of the street, which is quite easy to find, but parking is as always in Barcelona a problem. Although private apartments, you can go inside the front entrance for free and there is a tour of the first floor, attic and terrace. You can hire",
          "This is my absolute favourite thing we did in Barcelona. We visited all the main Gaud\u00ed houses and the church, but this blew us away. So so cool. A must see!",
          "Amazing how someone of that era could imagine something as thought out for convience and design etc. etc.",
          "No waiting in line and a much better experience due to a smaller group. As we were leaving, we saw that there were hoards of people filing through. A very memorable experience and a very informative audio guide. What an exquisite work of art.",
          "A very fun house ...architecture is brilliant....My wife and I truly enjoyed the one hour visit thru this home....you will too",
          "Great attraction must item in you schedule.we have visited in 06/Oct @ afternoon Relatively fast queue lines Nice to have the audio guide to understand more about gaudi",
          "Casa Batllo was a very ok visit. The line was short (you can buy tickets when you get there instead of ahead of time), and it wasn't terribly crowded. You get a headset tour with an old IPhone that shows a 3D rendering of the house (augmented reality). Honestly though it was",
          "Nice introduction to the history of Gaudi & a must see to appreciate. The pics are great but much better in person. Beware, once inside the tour begins with stairs & goes up several flights. I suggest buying tickets prior to arrival. Blue ticket holder line moved relatively",
          "Built or better said rebuilt by the famous Catalan architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed for the Batll\u00f3 family at the beginning of the 20th century, Must see.",
          "Gaudi was a very talented architect. It was amazing to see it in person and to hear the story why he did certain design element in the house was interesting. I would recommend seeing it.",
          "We got there at dusk and went inside to explore. It is very interesting. When we left it was dark and lite up like in the photo and was beautiful!",
          "This is a definite \"don't miss\" on your trip to Barcelona. Make sure to buy your ticket ahead of time.",
          "Compared to other main attractions in the heart of Barcelona this was the most crowded place and the most expensive as well. Also equipment for audio guided tour wasn't good and rooms without furniture could be visited.",
          "Casa Batllo is a Gaudi masterpiece. His inspiration is drawn from marine life, the hues of the ocean and even from the Catalonian patron saint St.George. From the lower levels with the walls etched with a fish scale design to the different hues of the ocean that can be viewed at",
          "It was enjoyable, looking at the various rooms, and seeing how Gaudi transformed what we think of as normal habitation into something more playful and interesting, yet still very functional, in some cases more so. The timed entrance seemed to be handled well, so the crowds were",
          "The house is lovely, definitely something worth seeing if you have time. I felt this tour offered what I expected and was well organized even on a crowded day.",
          "This building showcases just how brilliant Gaudi was in every aspect of design and building. The audio interface was very good, I loved the hand held device that showed what the rooms would have looked like furnished in the style of the times.",
          "This is a house Gaudy designed for a wealthy family. Must visit. Shows the brilliance of Gaudy. The movement and colors in his design are spectacular. Get the private room ticket. The decor is interesting and gives you time to digest the scene.",
          "Casa Batilo is something to see for sure! Outside is amazing architecture BUT just wait until you walk inside! I was speechless in AWE of this humble magnificent place. Gaudi was a talented creator.",
          "another architectural marvel of barcelona. Strange, twisted, but hugely attractive. Highly recommended",
          "I did an early entry and while a little expensive, it made the experience very personal. The building is a delight, the audio tour a nice touch and quite informative. A must do Gaudi experience.",
          "Loved it top to bottom. Love architecture and the audioguide was very helpful. Rooftop views where fantastic.",
          "Worth a visit like most of the Antoni Gaudi's building around Barcelona. Purchase the ticket in advance.",
          "We did early access and it was DEFINITELY worth it. There were people on the tour but you were able to enjoy your surroundings, not feel rushed, and get great photos without a ton of people in them.",
          "I enjoyed seeing Casa Battlo but from all the photos I have seen, expected more. It is again very crowded and everyone is always taking photos which becomes annoying. Interesting place to visit overall.",
          "Great looking building. Should cut down the trees in front of the building as it blocks your view and takes away from the building",
          "This is my favorite Gaudi work. His use of color and light is amazing. He was so far ahead of his time. His use of the shapes in nature in his designs make everywhere you go in this Casa feel like the most soothing flow of energy. I just wish I could have seen it without so many",
          "Wonderful audio with visuals to accompany. Would have been nice to have been given quick basic instructions with the audio. Didn\u2019t realize there was a visual on the audio device until the second room. The gold admission allowed for priority entrance, but then you are",
          "The place itself did a fantastic job; my rating is because I enjoyed other things in Barcelona more. We bought blue tickets, it was worth saving my euros and waiting in line for about 15-20 minutes. We went at 1115. The app is excellent, paints a great picture. Very",
          "Quite intriguing venue, well worth a visit. Quite busy, so you can't always get a clear shot for your photos. Quite a lot of steps to climb. But even to someone not much into architecture, quite worthwhile.",
          "This is one of the most interesting properties I have ever visited. It\u2019s a MUST visit if you are in Barcelona. Buying fast-track tickets on-line was a good decision; making entry quick and easy. It was very crowded and therefore difficult to try and capture photos without other",
          "Casa Batilo is one of the most interesting houses that i ever visit! The architecture and the colours used inside and outside are outstanding! I visit the house with my wife and my 6 years old son who was impressed by everything it was inside ! Gaudi rules! Must see the house",
          "The Casa Batllo is the most original and dream like house designed and built by Antonio Gaudi - 1904 to 1906. We were a family of 6 - grandparents (us), our son, our 12 year old granddaughter, our son's sister in law and her 9 year old son - three generations. We bought tickets",
          "Really enjoyed visiting here and the audio guide was ideal. Loved it and seeing the outside at night is lovely.",

          "We had not pre-booked and fortunately did not have to wait long to buy our tickets.There are three categories blue,silver and gold.As we were not pushed for time we opted for blue which was 26 E each as a concession for seniors.The Audio Guide-included-was easy to use and the",
          "Although it is crowded it is well worth it to go see this wonderful home. The augmented reality adds to it all to give you the feeling as to how these rooms looked when it was a home. Go! You won\u2019t regret it!!",
          "The outside is really something to see and then when you go for the inside tour and the roof top, well lets just say you have to see it yourself as the architecture is so unique.",
          "Would I go again - Yes as there was some refurbishment areas that I couldn't view. If you do not have a great deal of time then I would definitely purchase the fast track pass as you wont need to wait. You are given an audio guide which is excellent, very clear sound, great",
          "Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s most well known private residence Casa Batllo is an incredible piece of artistic architecture and should be visited by everyone visiting Barcelona. Photos cannot do it justice. Ensure that you grab the audio guide (available in most languages) on your way in.",
          "Can see how his house inspired so many people. An enjoyable visit. Need someone on stairway to remind visitors not to walk down the middle of the stairwell impeding others. People can be rude and careless effecting others making their way up. Needs control.",
          "The tour was well organized and gave plenty of time to look though the house. The only negative comment is that there was construction on one of the areas and the alternative way to look through the area was not week explained.",
          "I recommend this tour. The house of the sea by Gaudi. The audio guide is great. Last 1.5 hours. Augmented reality is used on certain objects Very interesting.",

          "Casa Battlo was a living, functioning home, and its details are staggering. You can really appreciate Gaudi's obsessive attention to everything right here. Do not miss it.",
          "One of the many architectures by Gaudi. Looks great from the outside, but did not happen to go in as there was a very long queue. heard on the mix reviews inside",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed touring Casa Batllo. I would recommend the audio guide as it brings this Gaudi house alive. Very worth seeing as a way to get a fuller picture of Gaudi the architect.",
          "The tour was worthwhile to explore the unique early designs of Gaudi. Lots of beautiful inspiration to admire.",
          "The exterior is fabulous, Gaudi is a great artist, but I think 25 \u20ac (the cheapest ticket, if u buy online) is too much for an empty \u201cmuseum\u201d. I liked one room, the stair house and the roof; besides that, not even the informations from audio-visual tour didnt impress me. It\u2019s",

          "We pre purchased tickets for the tour and the evening concert on the roof top. The tour is neat with the interactive phones showing you what the rooms would have looked like in the past. We were supposed to see a Beatles cover band but one of their members was ill. A Tom",
          "even in the off-season, this is a sight to behold; and many, many people come to visit; definitely consider getting the VIP entry (Gold line) that can be obtained online, as you can pick your time and go directly in without waiting. The audio/visual guide is well worth the",

At the time I went they were renovating  parts of the building, best to book on line if you can for tickets, as long queues,  inside is so amazing, especially the stairwell.

I think I would have liked to see it, it looks like a furnished living area from the little slice of window you can peek in.\n\nPricey, but excellent.",

          "I would give it 5 stars if fewer visitors were in the building. I booked for first tour time, 9am, but tour groups were admitted in advance and so there was little time to slowly take in the buildings wonderful features without feeling as though you were getting in another visitor's way.",
          "Was a bit hesitant because of the price (\u20ac22 for students) but as an architecture student, I felt I owed it to my education to go. It was definitely worth it! Beautiful building, the audio guide was informative and just all around a great curated experience. Highly recommended!",
          "Interesting and unusual house. It makes  impression like visiting fairy tail, or someone's dream. What also I can admit is smart guide with function of additional reality. That makes visit interesting not only for adults but also for kids.",
          "We went on the night visit and it was truly amazing, extremely worth it. We drank a glass of wine while walking in the museum wearing flashlights on our heads and headphones everything was really interesting and the view from the rooftop was also really nice",
          "Another extraordinary example of Gaudi architecture. as the guide books say, extremely expensive. If you walk up a couple of blocks you can see the same extraordinary Gaudi work in Casa Mila",
          "Great example of Gaudi architecture. The guided tour that is provided with the ticket is amazing. Keep in mind, it is better to bring your own headphones.",

          "Great and astonishing bulding. Loved the design of all the rooms. Great tool - tablet to see through it and see the past how the rooms looked alike. Recommend to book tickets online not to wait long rows to enter.",
          "It's a very pretty house with stunning architecture. We didn't go inside, as there was a huge crowd and the tickets were quite expensive. It's not the price that annoys me, but the big crowds that are too busy to take lots of selfies and no one actually just sitting there for a moment to simply enjoy the view.",
          "A must visit. Great to see and understand how Gaudi conceive the world and translate it to architecture.",

          "Very beautiful art in this house. An unforgettable experience. Every visitor to this city should see it.",
          "A must! Its a house without any corners! All inspired by nature... The feeling when you leave the house is amazing... it busy though \nespecially when they have the concerts on the roof in June. I went with my 5 year old and he loved it. The \u2026",
          "That case when the site from outside looks more impressive than inside. Have no idea why the entrance fee is so high. Good news for all of you - since summer 2019 all the renovation works are over and facade is visible and shining as never :)",
          "Amazing place and work of genius! Worth the money to visit. Brought blue tickets",
          "Amazing work by Gaud\u00ed. The guide is interactive you can see animations of every room. \nLong lines but it\u2019s better to buy tickets in advance, You can spend as much time as you like absorbing the whole place. Fantastic from top to bottom.",
          "Worth every single Euro cent. I don't want to say anymore as it will sound like I'm overblowing it when in reality I'd still be underselling it. Just go!",
          "Beautiful building. The tour was great with handsets giving commentary plus also visually showing you how it used to look. Very clever. Well worth a visit.",
          "An absolute Marvel to learn more about how Gaudi had economical and functional reasons for his designs. There was so much more to it vs what the eye sees. A must visit!!! Amazing genius!",
          "Gaudi's work is unreal, and well displayed in this outstanding architectural masterpiece.\n\nTickets are quite expensive - try and book them online for a slightly reduced price, and save yourself some queueing time on the way...",
          "Don't waste high entry ticket to go inside for you will be very very disappointed to visit an empty small house with overcrowded people all around.   Totally not worth to line up.   Just take the best picture outside the building for free.",
          "A great way to experience Gaudi's amazing architectural work with a self-guided audio tour. We thoroughly enjoyed it!",
          "Beautiful Gaud\u00ed's Art Nouveau creation well worth exploring for the couple of hours. During our second visit we took the guided Theatrical tour for kids and adults, available in several languages - in our case Russian. That was an amazing \u2026",
          "Its incredibly awesome that's what I call amazing architecture.",
          "It's a beautiful site outside, however, I was disappointed by what was inside. The interior was not visually impressive, but  I think the most disappointing thing for me was the audio guide, which did not have substantial information. The \u2026",
          "The place is so crowed that it's almost impossible to appreciate the art and the history behind it. It's recommended to buy tickets and guides weeks or months before your visit, so you may have a change to see it. It's located in a busy area, there are public transportation lines available, also touristic lines as well.",
          "My favourite of all Gaudi\u2019s work. Amazing colours and it\u2019s worthwhile to pay for the experience inside. Visit both during the day and night for a different perspective",
          "Real touristic place. Nice to see outside but dont go in.",
          "You can really connect with Dali\u2019s sense of design and philosophy which stays true to every detail of the house. The augmented reality is a nice touch but psychedelics would be a better shout in order to bring this to life.",
          "Worth to visit, we had gold ticket and had a vintage photo, it was also a good souvenir to remember \ud83d\ude0a",
          "An amazing place. Really must visit it if you are in Barcelona. I loved the cool and updated technology they use. A big big must see",

          "Beautiful Gaudi building in the middle of the city. It provides very good overview for the Gaudi's architecture and the people working here are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended to visit. It is one of the must visit places in \u2026",
          "Beautiful work of art and architecture. Motion and structure all done without the aid of computers calculators, pure genius.",
          "The architecture is splendid. However the furniture is mostly dispersed amongst different museums, so you will only see empty rooms. Thus, I am not sure if it is worth the price.",
          "The building is certainly an architectural Gaudi masterpiece. It\u2019s very sad to see that it\u2019s used in a very business oriented manner. The smart guide was very disappointing. Very overrated. I expected much more, much better technology, much more content, especially given the price that was payed for it.",
          "Very beautiful house. Impressive well conserved. Issue with line at entrance... Despite reservation no guarantee to enter on due time and long line. Direct sales get in before r\u00e9servation !",
          "Wonderful places and they make shows inside, if you have time in Barcelona try to attend one show",
          "Amazing visit. Visit this place during daylight helps to see how incredible Gaudi's imagination is incredible. Pay attention on the smartaudio guide that shows the old house style.",
          "Book online for a cheaper price, come early before the entrance is open, you\u2019ll enjoy it way much better with less queue and less people. Audio guide is helpful and available in various languages.",
          "I\u2019ve done this tour twice in the past 3 years and love it! Definitely recommend it. The Gold or Premium experience isn\u2019t that great but a friendly tip buy your tickets online!",
          "Though the place looks cool from outside, I felt the ticket price is exaggerated. Mostly ppl seemed to be taking pictures right outside.",
          "A necessary stop when traveling and exploring. Very unique and beautiful.",
          "People know that this is not just a building, it's a piece of art. It is something unique that you definitely need to visit at least once in your lifetime. Incredible architectural design and the whole decor is something to talk about. \u2026",
          "Definitely worthwhile to visit, even if you only look at the outside of the building. There are many other interesting buildings in the area, so I recommend you wander around and look at the architecture.",
          "I guess there's not much to say about the building that you don't know. The building is a masterpiece very well preserved, you can see decoration and furniture, design by Gaudi. \n1. Buy the tickets online, they are cheaper and you make less \u2026",
          "Amazing place Been waiting a long time to visit and so worth the wait!",
          "The pictures taken inside were our best souvenir from barcelona. The setup is pretty cool!",
          "Very cool building and beside two others which are amazing.  It's so impressive what people were able to build and have it last all these years",
          "Best place. You should definitely visit this!!",
          "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.. got no words for it. Absolutely amazing",
          "Simply beautiful. One of my favorite places in Barcelona. Totally worth the tour to learn more about modernism and see the magic inside the house.",
          "Beautiful, amazing and wonderful to see. Gaudi was something else and ahead of his time. Definitely worth the time as it's right by a train stop.",
          "Very nice and interesting architecture. Definitely worth visiting from the outside. Not much from the inside and waste of money to purchase the ticket for the inside.",
          "It's a nice place to visit, but I would suggest to get the blue pass, since you will see almost the same thing as gold and silver except one room which is okay.",
          "Lovely place to visit. A must see if you like architecture and visit Barcelona, Catalonia.",
          "Great example of Modernism: my favourite expression of Gaud\u00ec",
          "It's amazing and very well preserved... It's a jewel in the middle of the city",
          "Truly one of Gaudi's most exquisite pieces. Gaud\u00ed designed this house for a successful businessman looking to set himself apart among the Catalonian well-to-do families. Gaud\u00ed delivered with this house with a fantastic range of movement in \u2026",
          "The beauty of this building does not to be described. At this place you can start to feel, to experience, to understand Gaudi. The AR supported audio guide is guite useful, only few times cannot be followed. The store is varied. The ticket price is little bit expensive , but worth it.",
          "Nice although for that price I would expect more. Room with furniture- just one is additionally paid",
          "Go in for the tour it\u2019s amazing. Worth every cent. Be prepared to be challenged in your traditional thinking of Architecture",
          "One of the most popular place to visit in Barcelona. And actually I like this place the best in Barcelona.",
          "Wow! A must visit if you are in Barcelona. Gaudi was a genius. Audio guide comes with a smart phone that gives you virtual insight of how the house looked when it was first built. Entrance fee is not cheap but its worth it.",
          "Beautiful building. Really fascinating tour. But very expensive.",
          "Whimsical and pretty on the outside. A bit of a disappointment though to be honest, isn't quite worth the hype. The inside is cramped and quite plain.",
          "Waste of ~\u20ac22 roughly per person . They charge too much, I spent about 10minutes inside only! Maybe I am not easily impressed?\n\nArchitecture is decent and unique ofcourse being designed by Gaudi, not much to see inside as you'll most likely \u2026",
          "The One and only casa bailo Barcelona. Historical beauty must stop gaudi masterpiece",
          "If you go to barcelona you cannot skip this masterpiece. The visit in this house is amazing, it s like to stay in gaudi's mind. It s amazing.\nThe ticket could be expensive for someone but it is worth it, totally! \nThe maintenance of the \u2026",
          "Incre\u00edble architecture! You\u2019ll definitely enjoy the building.",
          "You stand outside, and all ready you're thinking, \"wow, stunning, this is going to be an interesting experience.\". And interesting it was.  Gaudi has created something truly unique, mixing nature and life in his well known and partially \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful building with a lot of art. The audio guide helps a lot to understand Gaudi\u2019s ideas. Great experience!",
          "Stunning views and works of art. Well worth a visit",
          "Must see. Beautiful place.  Looks great when lit up at night too.",
          "Staff was not friendly & security angrily stares at everyone, but a decent cologne collection. Normally I would not spend money with people like these, BUT they have a good selection of Kilian and Clive Christian. They do not have Bond #9. They had one cologne that I was looking for...",
          "Incredible architecture and a must visit to see the building from the outside at least if you find yourself in Barcelona! I mean it's a UNESCO world heritage site!",
          "One of Gaudi\u2019s must see pieces of art (it really is!) in Barcelona. Purchase tickets in advance to avoid lines and waiting. A tour of the house is about an hour long depending on how quickly you view things.",
          "Such a great monument to visit!",
          "INCREDIBLE!!!!! We were truly blown away by how amazing every single part of the house was - what a true masterpiece!",
          "Amazing. Gaudi was & is inspiring, artistic and 100 years ahead of his time on ergonomic and environmental design.",
          "Very nice place were you can understand deeply Gaudi\u2019s ideas. Easy to reach but quite difficult to explore if you don\u2019t like/can\u2019t do many steps. Very pricey for what you get, but probably a must see in Barcelona, with an amazing view from the top.",
          "Has to be seen from the inside. Nice history and a different architectural experience",
          "If I could give this place 13 stars instead of 5 I would. Better than everything else I've seen in Barcelona, out this on the \"do this ahead of everything else if you've only got 2 hours in Barcelona\" list",
          "Fantastical, curving dragon-roofed apartment block, now a museum, created by architect Antoni Gaudi.\n\nGet the tickets online and save yourself \u20ac5. We got the gold ticket so we can pass the line but it\u2019s not necessary since the line moves \u2026",
          "Stuning architecure. What is interesting -  also surrounding buildings are absolutely incredible. Pearl of architecure.",
          "Such a great building. The audio guide really helps to understand the magic the Gaudi had by designing this beautiful building.100% recommended if you like art, design, and architecture.",
          "You can see the gift shop from the street, and there's a little unit that spins - very cool. Honestly though, so worth the walk over (ofc we got a taxi, so what do I know)",
          "Very nice and historic place go visit. Must see in Barcelona.",
          "Very interesting building, with some fun architectural history & background in the audio guide.  You're given a camera with your audio guide (like a cell phone), which you can point to view what the house would have looked like in its \u2026",
          "Interesting setup. It's a building designed by a famous architect. Found it a bit overrated.",
          "It was ok, looked much better in pictures, atleast now I can chalk it off my list that we have seen it in person. Nothing special. Might be more appealing for people with an architectural eye. I thought the building next to it looked better.",
          "Very unique external design. Suppose inside will be equally amazing but there is a charge. Probably suite an architectural student.",
          "The promotional images are just lies. The images are telling you that you'll get a colourful and exciting experience. And what you really get? A series of grayish, neglegted rooms, reparations on the wall with insulating tape, a lot of \u2026",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this building and hearing a bit about its history. I think that lines to get inside are almost always going to be long but well worth the short wait. Also, there is so much to see around Casa Batll\u00f3 and so many \u2026",
          "Fantastic experience with AR tech. Must visit in Barcelona, to experience the genious Gaudi!",
          "100% worth it! Stepping in you feeling like you're in an underwater Dr Suess book. Every little element from the fish-like tiles to the unique door handles are beautiful and fun. An audio tour tells you interesting things about Gaudi and \u2026",
          "So interesting, must see. The audio guide is working great.",
          "Not worth the visit inside (Overpriced).\nMeant to be appreciated from the streets.",
          "Beautiful, I love Gaudi! But when I was there, there was a big renovation going one, so that the actual beauty was covered by plastic. \nBut they are planning a balcony around the building, so one everybody can get closer to the magician piece of art.",
          "Amazing Gaudi designed building. The balconies look like masks, the top looks like a dragon, the lines in the columns and structure are non-uniform and just amazing. If you are lucky you can see a free night light show that shows what the \u2026",
          "Unique building by Gaudi. Very interesting and is worth your time and money. Highly recommended.",
          "Another amazing piece of art by Antoni Gaud\u00ed. Casa Battl\u00f3 is a house designed by Gaud\u00ed in the heart of Barcelona. The window railings are skull shaped and the pillars are supposed to look like bones. I would recommend to go here in the night as there is an event known as Moon Nights everyday at 20:30.",
          "The palace is obviously great and is one of the best creation of Gaud\u00ec. Anyway 29 euros is really too much for that kind of visit.",
          "Beautiful Hotel.  I loved the Christmas Decorations at night. Very Festive.",
          "Perfect architecture and pleasant view with great colors. We can spend thirty minutes around here.  And surrounded by busy streets and crowded roads and many food centers are near by.",
          "Absolute must see attractions.  No detail was left out. I am in love!",
          "Oh mine, so much good things to say about this place. But I will focus on the logistics:\n1. Line is not as crazy as other Gaudi attractions. I went at 4pm on a Tuesday and was able to get tickets in 5 minutes and went in immediately. There \u2026",
          "This place will make all visitors speechless. \nSo much thought has been put into building this place.\nThe line up moves fast, so unless it is SUPER busy, don\u2019t bother with Gold Ticket.\nI spend about an hour in this place but you will never \u2026",
          "I do not recommend this visit for anyone. The tickets are overpriced.I strongly recommend to visit \u201cLa Pedrera\u201d instead.",
          "Really pretty from the outside... Unfortunately we changed our mind and didnt go in because of the price and too many people waiting the line and inside...",
          "Very cool building. Did not wait in line to go inside but super easy to see from the street and take it in.",
          "Amazing! Every little detail thoroughly thought, every shard of tile carefully placed, every color in its rightful spot, shapes perfectly combined leading to an overall effect of fluidity and grandeur. Aesthetics combined with utility. \nWorth the time and money.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit and the outside shows a beautiful, artistic application of a strange but interesting mind.  The only thing that keeps me from 5 stars here is that all of Barcelona seems to run in one rule --you can climb \u2026",
          "Stunning, charming and just mind blowing! This piece of architecture is truly out of a dream, the best combination of practicality and design. Gaud\u00ed's best for sure! Don't miss it if you visit Barcelona.",
          "This is whole another world. Modern art, architecture and atmosphere. I liked every floor of this house with no straight lines. Antonio Gaudi was a genius who created this magical building. Go ahead and visit this museum and don't forget about open terrace with colourful mosaics and beautiful scene",
          "The house is relatively small but one of the most exotic and beautiful buildings ever made by Gaudi. Although there are a lot of floors, the tour takes place only in a few of them, those with the most iconic and important architectural \u2026",
          "As you are walking through the city there are these hidden gems nearly tucked into the city buildings. You just need to keep an eye out. Its a plesent suprise then you suddenly stumble across Gaudis work. You could really appreciate the \u2026",
          "Really special place. The ticket is very worth it. If you are traveling to Barcelona you have to visit.",
          "Vas\u2019s Batll\u00f3 is an amazing building, and actually my favorite if the Gaudi buildings. He has created these really beautiful spaces with light color and curves. Awesome.",
          "One of the most beautiful places I ever went to",
          "Casa Batllo is a dream, the creation of a beautiful mind. It is an incredible place where you can spend hours discovering wonders at every step, admiring every curve of the fluid walls, every piece of glass playing with the light. I think \u2026",
          "Beautiful from the outside but really worth visiting the inside as well!",
          "Casa Batll\u00f3 is much more expensive compared to other Gaudi attractions in the area. Personally, I thought it was worth it just due to how gorgeous it is and also the super cool digital tour. I highly recommend ordering the tickets online, \u2026",
          "The building is beautiful, inside and out. Absolutely gorgeous!\n\nThe audio guide was good too, but it ran out of battery midway through. It was very difficult to find a member of staff to help. I eventually had to go back downstairs and \u2026",
          "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PLACE. they also have ipod that works like a mirror the past and shows how exactly it was the house in the past",
          "Very interesting spot to visit for architecture lovers. The price for an adult is \u20ac29 which I think is a bit overpriced for what is a very quick tour inside but if you love beautiful buildings then this should definitely be on your list.",
          "Absolutely loved best to plan tickets online in advance got to miss the really long ques",
          "Beautiful house. A must see attraction in Barcelona. I would definitely recommended the guided your (not with the audio guide) so you can get a full explanation of the inside, the story and the background. Would recommend this to any traveller in the area!",
          "Must visit. I liked the forms and the play of colors.",
          "Well setup. Good audio guide. Many stairs. Interesting building",
          "The building itself is beautiful and amazing. I came here 7+ years ago and it was definitely something to awe at. These days, an audio tour + screen is included with your ridiculously overpriced ticket (29 Euro), which depicts what the \u2026",
          "Casa Batll\u00f3 or locally known as Casa dels ossos (House of Bones) because of its skeletal properties. This is a pretty iconic building in Barcelona Spain and there\u2019s no lack of flare in its design. Falling into the category of Modernisme or \u2026",
          "Of all Gaudi's works I saw in Barcelona this one is my favourite - both for its architectural and artistic quality and in terms of presentation.",
          "Cool house to visit tho pricy. The architect is a master piece.",
          "If you go early enough in the morning (9am) you can still purchase tickets to this amazing building and the audio visual guide is fabulous -do put this in your itinerary. There is also the opportunity to see the way Gaudi designed the air \u2026",
          "Wonderful.\nTry visit early in the morning.\nIt gets VERY busy later in the day.",
          "Go take at least a picture of Gaudi's Casa Balto. Once in a lifetime architecture.",
          "Fantastic place with this evening lights ! But we hadn\u2019t enough time to come in - there was a queue",

          "Nice place. Highly recommend to see it",
          "Great place to visit! A very interesting building!",
          "Amazing architecture. The video guide was quite good to see how it's been looking in the past, accompanied with good explanation. Pretty amazing.",
          "Only visit if you are interested in his artistic expressions or in architecture.",
          "Really beautiful. If you buy gold ticket you will get free photos too. Super cute",
          "Nice to see. Not far from the scenic bus stop routes. Good to see and stop off instead of passing by. Note not many eateries in the area.",
          "The best place in Barcelona. One can't help but marvel at this piece of Gaudi's work. Every little detail inside the house is an experience.",
          "Might be sufficient to view from the outside but if you would like to learn more about Gaudi and his architecture background then do visit!",
          "Extraordinary building. We stayed in an hotel facing it and we had the most amazing view",
          "A bit pricy (25\u20ac admitance fee), but worth it. Always busy and crowded though. Take a tour with a visual guide. Augmented reality really does a thing to all of history.",
          "Completely overpriced. Rip off!",
          "A must visit if you love Gaudi",
          "The AR virtual guide is a very good idea.",

          "Very impressive architecture from gaudi. It's pretty busy all the time so be prepared to rub shoulders with all the other tourists. Make sure you keep a close eye on your valuables in and amongst the crowds outside the building too",
          "Tickets are expensive but we were able to see a lot from the outside. It is beautiful and if you have the time and the money go in, if not, no big lost",
          "Have to visit and see once with your own eyes",
          "It really feels like a trip into the deep ocean! Go early in the morning to avoid crowds.",
          "The things, interactivity is worth 5 stars, but I thought it's expensive",
          "One of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona was this 2 hour self guided audio tour of thia amazing Gaudi classic , Book ahead as like most of the premier sights this was very busy but we could walk past the large queue and up to the desk \u2026",
          "Very nice experient. One of the best in Barcelona.",
          "Outside is stunning must go inside next time!",
          "Must visit for architectures. An amazing example of buildings construction. It was designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaud\u00ed and has been \u2026",

          "It is a master piece of a modernism Palace, Antoni Gaudi most famous House in Barcelona",
          "Near the end you'll find a possibility of taking photo in a balcony. It seems pretty, but you don't know the price until they give you copy printed out (by that point you kinda feel like to pay since they already printed it out) in next \u2026",
          "So colorful and mesmerizing, another masterpiece by Gaudi that you must add to your bucket-list.  We went inside with our private guide and it was amazing, but it's still worth seeing from the outside even if you don't go in.",
          "Well made exposition. Well explained audio guide. I feel I payed a bit too much for the whole experience. I recommend it though!",

          "Beautiful place. The entrance was a bit exaggerated. \nFriendly staff",
          "Beautiful, fantastical, ethereal- Gaudi at his best!! Welcome to his  magical underwater world like no other - as you spiral and swirl through staircases, corridors, rooms and roof terraces, you will feel like a fairy flying fish - in and out of water",

          "If you\u2019re just going to do one of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s buildings besides La Sagrada Familia, this is the one. It was very interesting to see. We paid extra for the tour of the special room, which I would not do again\u2014not worth that.",

          "Casa Batllo is another great specimen of Gaudi's outstanding architecture. A very unique building indeed.... you won't come across buildings like these very often. In first look, it doesn't look real rather a building from a comic / cartoon \u2026",
          "Really loved it. Place like this is dream holiday destinations for me.",
          "Beautiful and fascinating house turned museum that is a testament to the creativity of Gaudi. There is a mandatory audio tour, which is very helpful. Children will also find it engaging. #protip: buy your tickets in advance!!! Lines are \u2026",

          "Ohh beautiful work by Antoni Gaudi, seems  Gaudi's works are the only major attractions in Barcelona. Batllo is a four storey structure owned by private couple the entry fee for normal blue card costs 29 euros and by online 25 euros which \u2026",

          "No need to give me details of this fantastic place but just a tip, be there early or late like noon or late afternoon (save you some time before closing hour) to avoid tour groups, also, do get gold ticket VIP pass, it's the most worthy VIP \u2026",
          "Amazing work! You know from outside look it's gonna be something special, but the interier is simply stunning and gorgeous. Worthy to visit.",
          "Very impressive building from the outside, but I just don\u2019t get, why should I pay to get a photo from the inside, a.k.a a photo of the people standing outside.",
          "Interesting building designed by Gaud\u00ed. Visiting is possible during day and evenings. However, walking inside is not that jaw dropping. One should prioritize spending time in Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.",
          "There are so many visitors! The whole hall, every room and corridor are full of people. If you want to take a picture of no one around you, you must be patient enough. But even so, I recommend you to take a look!\nCasa Batllo house was one \u2026",
          "Amazing.  A true artist.  As someone who enjoys art history, I somehow missed this brilliant work.  Worth the visit.",
          "Great place. Beautiful architecture",
          "While it\u2019s nice to explore historical landmarks, I just left feeling underwhelmed. With the cheapest entry price of \u20ac25 to see 3 empty floors where some areas were under construction and a large space assigned for a gift shop I can\u2019t \u2026",
          "Amazing building with incredible rooms and beautiful decorations. It might be expensive but it\u2019s worth to get in",
          "Fantastic place. Really good design both inside and outside. Make sure to visit.",
          "We did the Magic Nights at Casa Battlo which was 39\u20ac each and we\u2019re pretty disappointed. Kids everywhere, the one \u201cfree drink\u201d was a pulpy orange juice dominated \u201cmimosa.\u201d We left as soon as the band started because they weren\u2019t very good. \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture combined with art, nature, ergonomics and practical sense",
          "Really good architecture demonstrating Gaudi's best work.",
          "Outstanding and unique example of Antoni Gaud\u00ed's work",
          "Casa Batll\u00f3 is a magnificent building designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed and built-in 1877.",
          "The feel of this building creates a cool atmosphere that can only be understood through experience. Both the outside and inside have very unique aspects from courtyard to the roof. It also has an interactive tour where you can actually see \u2026",
          "Beautiful house, we went at night and it was even more magical.",
          "Specially designed for sunny day. So in rainny day you can skip it",
          "Fabulous place. The interactive guide was a very good thing",
          "Interesting food, fashionably unstructured or revised and tasty . I will recommend.",
          "The architecture of this place is amazing. It is a must visit place for tourists.",
          "Love \u2764\ufe0f it very inspirational.",
          "Most was closed. But over all decent",
          "It's a beautiful place place to visit and see the architectural design",
          "Absolutely amazing.  Would highly recommend. As this is absolutely different from rest of the buildings. So unique and artistic. Loved it.",
          "A must if you're visiting Barcelona. Excellent audio guide. Better if you buy ticket online so you will have the priority",
          "This place is truly an architectural wonder of the modern world. Definitely take the time to do the tour with the tablet if you get a chance to visit.",
          "One of the must to visit tourist attraction while visiting Barcelona.",
          "Visited Casa Batll\u00f3 on an August Summer\u2019s evening and was amazed by the excellent tour provided by the portable guide and the amount of interaction the AR encouraged with the building. Gaudi was a genius in Modernist architecture, and the story behind this building makes it very much worth a visit if in Barcelona.",
          "Wonderfully indicative of Gaudi's limitless idea of architecture as art.",
          "I always wonder were these people had money and time do such beautiful things in their life. Nice to visit. If you want to go in without staying in queue you have to pay \u00a34 more. Why? I have no idea. Maybe because of ADMINISTRATION!!",
          "Great place, great experience.  Love it",
          "I was not too happy with this place and I can go into some detail as to why...\nFirst and foremost it is a little expensive for the experience. It's a very small house, you'll maybe spend 1-2 hours if you take the audio tour. However, there \u2026",
          "Really interesting architecture.  I did the early tour prior to the crowds, and it was well worth it.",
          "Just amazing architecture and design. Something that is worth walking to and seeing in the flesh, whilst in Barcelona. There are also some lovely neighbouring buildings worth a peek",
          "Amazing architecture by Gaudi. The colors and rooms were very interesting.\n\nIf you need there is an elevator in the middle access to all floors.",
          "Fantastic AR tour, would reccomend the Gold Pass \u20ac35 per person (queue jump, access to extra areas, free themed photo shoot, bottle of water). The place itself is stunning, to try to describe it would be impossible, it is beautiful and \u2026",
          "A truly wonderful place to visit and worth every penny, the audio guide is superb and detailed.\nTake your time at this attraction and don't feel the need to be hurried along with the crowd as some people just seem to want to be in and out, \u2026",
          "It was good but don't you think they could of finished the buliding before letting us enter?",
          "Definitely worth it. The design is amazing. And the interactive headsets are great.",
          "Nothing like this anywhere else so it's well worth a visit.",
          "Casa hermosa. Viene con explicaciones gracias a un tel\u00e9fono. Pero es un poco caro \n\nBeautiful casa, you have explanations of every room thank to a mobile they gave you at the entrance. I find the price a little expensive ..",
          "Love the style but it is so busy!\nHowever, it worth being seen. It is so beautiful!",
          "Just so you know \u2014 I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go inside. What that being said, maybe it would be a lot cooler to go in! But if you\u2019re planning on just checking it out from the outside...it\u2019s pretty cool, definitely worth seeing if \u2026",
          "Most wonderful experience of my life .\nThe architecture is beyond beautiful .\nGaudi was a blessing to this earth !!!",
          "The house is amazing, it is like being in a dream. The tour with the audio guide is very interesting and it is  also suited for young children",
          "Small and crowded compared to Casa Mila; it may be worth considering to get the early bird ticket just to avoid the crowds. Otherwise it\u2019s fun to visit",
          "Definitely a must see in Barcelona! A full on exhibition of Gaudi's genius, it almost feels like the building itself is alive with its vibrant colors and carefully thought nature-inspired details.",
          "A beautiful historical building in the middle of Barcelona. I recommend it.",
          "This is work from Gaudi, famous artist and Architect. Casa Batllo is truly a sight to behold and easy to spot once you enter the main road, buying a ticket to go inside is an absolute must, be warned, mornings can get a little crowded, but \u2026",
          "A wonderful masterpiece. So awesome and unforgettable moment.",
          "Beautiful part of Barcelona, must see it",
          "Incredible building! Unfortunately we went while it was undergoing necessary restoration but it didn't really hinder our experience inside. The augmented reality tour was great, first time with something like that. Recommend the visit to the parlor with the original furniture. Definitely worth the visit!",
          "Fantastic place to visit. An amazing building. A bit costly to get in though. Buy ticket online to skip the queue.",
          "The house will be amazing once the restoration will be over, but now, unfortunately everything is gone. They will provide an AR mobile app so that you can experience how the place originally looked like, but still, it's not the same and I \u2026",
          "Quite extraordinary place within a modern district. But not fascinated to enter that place.",
          "Wonderful piece of art from Gaudi. Highly recommended when you are in Barcelona",
          "The building is beautiful from the outside but unless you like Pokemon Go or are some freaky fan of architecture, you will not like it at all. Building is empty inside and there is nothing to see. Unlike Sagrada Familia which was amazing. This was a disappointment. I cannot recommend to see the inside.",
          "To be honest, it was rather disappointing inside especially given the high entrance fee.  Plus you dont get to see the most of rooms which was pretty disappointing.",
          "Very cool place. Awesome really.  Busy at times.",
          "FUN FACT: This house is what inspired the mansion in Casper! \n\nIt looks amazing from the outside but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 100% worth going inside.",
          "We spent a few days in Barcelona and visited a number of all the sights that are there. Casa Battlo is one of Antoni Gaudi's works, the building is fantastic. We only seen it from the outside but the facade facing the street is fascinating. Many visitors and queues if you want to enter the building.",
          "Didn\u2019t have time for the tour but it seems like you save a few euros if you buy online vs at the booth. Sad I missed this tour, but glad I got to see the shell. Epic.",
          "One of the most Gaudi's piece of art",
          "Incredible architecture and the audio tour is so worth it! It uses augmented reality to show you what the house would've looked like years ago along with throwing in some cool Gaudi style tortoises floating around. This place was awesome to \u2026",
          "Lovely place to explore when in Barcelona, quite representative of its Unique Architecture by Gaudi",
          "Very Interesting work of Gaudi. Worth to visit if you are in Barcelona. You can buy your tickets online and there are choices what would you like to have during your visit .",
          "Loved visiting the Casa Battlo. It\u2019s absolutely stunning, and even though it\u2019s expensive, you do get an audio tour included which has partial augmented reality for the house which was nice. I have never quite seen anything like this before, \u2026",
          "Very intriguing place...gold package not worth it unfortunately",
          "Try the early entrance ticket. It is nice not to have many people.",
          "There are no words to describe it and photos are surely not making justice to it. It's a great design and you have to wonder how Gaudis mind worked to design such a beautiful house. The attention to details, the glass work, the shapes and \u2026",
          "Gau\u010f\u00ed best work on house  option.  As the interior has only minor interest  exhibition  the outside facade is a work of a genius.",
          "The building was iconic! A passionate architect!",
          "Amazing place!  Loved it.  The architecture is just breathtaking. The audio was so useful.",
          "Amazing place. Everyone must know Gaud\u00ed. He was a genius without formal education. He was pure intuition. However, the only benefit of buying tickets online is that you save 4 euros but not a queue.",
          "Very nice place, BUT the evening concert ticket isn\u2019t a good deal... music was not bad, but no places to sit and it\u2019s very crowded. Not worth the extra EUR over the regular price.",
          "Honestly, don't do it. The place is amazing from Outside. Inside it is cool, but quite empty. The audio guide is interesting but you only have access to Two of The 5 floor. Naked wire hanging from the top floor, empty rooms... This costs 29 \u2026",
          "Visited 10 years ago. Maintenance has not been maintained. Mildly disappointed and in retrospect would prefer to not have gone back. The other Gaudi properties are very impressive and 5+.",
          "Went and did not take the interactive device, big mistake but never the less it is an impressive place. Just be careful as there is a lot of stairs and mind your step",
          "Good example of Gaud\u00ed's genius",
          "Great audio visual tour and a lovely place to walk around",
          "So pretty, I want to live there =)",
          "Beautiful building.\n\nWe went for the Magic Nights event and the performance was great with a complimentary drink. \n\nHowever, we didn't like how wasteful the place is when it comes to taking group photos - they practically force you onto the \u2026",
          "Got the standard package. Well worth the price. The audio tour is very informative and the augenmented reality makes the experience of walking around immersive. Views of Barcelona at the top were absolutely incredible.",
          "The queues are still long even if you book your tickets with a time slot! Audio-visual guide is worth it as you get to see what it would have looked like. Amazing ideas by Guell.",
          "Famous artist, architect. Was under extensive repairs at our time of visit",
          "This is just gorgeous, the intricate work and the overall finished product is priceless",
          "Great place, awaiting the entrance. To small for tons of visitors. Get an appointment.",
          "Was small but full of inspiration. Paid for the golden tickets but was difficult to locate the hidden room where you can have your pic taken.",
          "A very interesting house, the design throughout is intricate and speaks volumes as to Gaudi as an architect and his futuristic designs. Pricey to get in, with the most expensive being on similar lines to going up the towers of the basilica, \u2026",
          "If you've got the money, it's really worth the visit. The audio-guide is intricate and really explains the history and style of the house. However, if you're traveling on a budget the \u20ac25 price tag (the student reduction is not that much either) is a bit steep, and you might better off passing in front and just seeing the fa\u00e7ade.",
          "Gaudi the genius. What a piece of priceless work. The tour itself  was very informative and interactive (even for kids, who was 4), thanks to augmented reality device. The blue ticket was a touch pricy at EUR25, but the experience was worth it.",
          "Amazing architecture and great digital guided tour",
          "This place stuns! Incredibly beautiful. Totally unique",
          "One of Gaudi beautiful design in barcelona",
          "Gaudi is a master, of his and our time. Breathtaking.\n\nTips- don't buy tickets at the door. Purchase just before you visit online for 4 euros less and walk straight in.",
          "A beautiful landmark in the centre of Barcelona. Unfortunately currently entirely covered over for renovation on its front facing so you actually can't see it. The building next door is also quite nice, a lot of the tourists were just taking pictures of that instead!",
          "Great architectural building. Definitely book in advance to save queuing and make sure you pick up an audio headset. The staff just let us walk through without giving us a headset and we missed quite a lot of information, needs to be more guidance when you walk in.",
          "Nice architecture, great view, lots (I mean LOTS) of tourists. It's better to go here early in the morning, I guess.",
          "If you love Gaudi's work, do visit this house.",
          "One of the beautiful architectures of Antoni Gaudi.",
          "Interesting architecture. A landmark in Barcelona. Crowded and a little too expensive to go to the rooftop.",
          "Casa Batll\u00f3 is a building in the center of Barcelona. It was designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaud\u00ed and has been refurbished several \u2026",
          "Very beautiful house! It is worth the price, great work of Gaudi!",
          "It is a must to visit this masterpiece of Gaudi. It is extremely fabulous and amazing that there are no words to describe this house. The AR experience is something new which I think enable one to have a better engagement with the house in the past.",
          "One of Gaudi's most iconic buildings! I have visited it 3 times over 10 years and still find it fascinating and intriguing. Definitely worth a visit even if you are only vaguely interested in architecture. It gives such insight to Gaudi and his work.",
          "The fountains are beautiful. In the winter, the show stats at",
          "What a wonderful building. I recommend buying a ticket online, normally waiting around an hour in the queue",
          "Tickets are too expensive, 29 euro per person plus 12 euro for photo.  The first floor and roof are only open parts.  It feels like you are paying to climb 5 flights of stairs as all other floors are off limits",
          "If you have time visit from inside would be great i did not have time so just view it from outside all the buildings in this area is as if in competition of each other so very well designed and detailed years ago. Great piece of art.",
          "Inside or out...its beautiful. You have to get there super early to check it out completely via tickets during high season. It's still cool to just see from the regular outside street view though. If you're an architect, you need to check it out further and go inside.",
          "Incredible!! Impressive work and really beautiful",
          "Strange house. Nice place to visit in Barcelona",
          "It made me happy to see this house. I cant tell this for any other house I've ever seen. So unique.",
          "Yes it's a gorgeous building, but not worth the 20 something euros to get inside. I love art and architecture but this was quite didisappointing considering the price and how it looks from the outside. However there are some amazing photo opportunities inside.",
          "Last entry at 7pm. Ignore the misinformation about closing times elsewhere online and in their own promotional material.",
          "So beautiful so worth going to see",
          "The best of the gaudi houses as far as i was concerned. Well worth going in. Queue from early on or book on line beforehand",
          "Beautiful place and definitely worth a visit. Buy tickets online to save a few euros. Keep in mind that a lot of renovation work is going on which can impact your experience (inside and outside). It's a shame that there is almost no furniture.",
          "Everything about Casa Battlo is simply beautiful and an experience to behold. Like the audio guide says, Casa Battlo was built to be touched so be prepared to touch everything from the ceramic wall tiles to the door and window knobs to the beautiful timber balustrades and furniture. A truly breathtaking experience.",
          "It's not possible to give more than 5 stars))\nIf you are a person who loves works of Gaud\u00ed, it is a must visit place for you",
          "Beautifully created house amazing views, unusual approach in design of some parts of the house by Gaudi.",
          "Incredible display of light inside the basilica.  In this, Gaudi was a genius.",
          "Representation of modern art/architecture.  I did not go inside...not really my thing.",
          "It's an amazing place! Unique and one of the \"must see\" places in Barcelona",
          "My review might have been a bit more positive had the house not been undergoing extensive renovation, but the condition of the home left much to be desired in it's current state.\n\nMy husband and I showed up the day of our visit and waited \u2026",
          "One more of the many interesting place to visit.",
          "Lovely place  and the host was very nice and helpful",
          "Antoni Gaudi. If you are in Barcelona you must to see all his works",
          "Didn't really visit the museum but can vouch for the delicious hot chocolate we've had! Pro tip... Get some fruit on the side to dip into the chocolate, and if you're not greedy one cup can do two people easily. It's the richest hot chocolate I've ever had.",
          "Got online tockets which helped to skip the line (in the end of November the line wasn't very huge but we saved definitely 30 minutes or more). The was audioguide included. And it's absolutely worth. You get lots of interesting information \u2026",
          "It\u2019s hard to find the words to describe Casa Batllo, perhaps because it looks like a carnival gone insane. One of architect Antoni Gaudi\u2019s most famous buildings, Casa Batllo is a mish-mash of colors, building materials and what-have-you \u2026",
          "Unfortunately the last time I was there, half of the building was being restored, so I missed a lot of its beauty. I did not get the chance to visit the interior, but judging by the outside, it's a marvel to behold. It's a must visit if you're in Barcelona.",
          "Another amazing example of Gaud\u00ed's work. Technology takes the tour to another level. The audioguide is an Android phone and has the neatest, interactive features.",

          "Another Gaud\u00ed building. Very cool design and if you get there early you can catch it before all the tour groups arrive",
          "Spent a great 1.5 hours here. Highly recommend the gold pass - skip the main queue as well as gain access to a different section near the gift shop.",
          "Beautiful house designed by Gaud\u00ed, you can get audioguides that also show you how the house looked through augmented reality, one of the many places designed by Gaud\u00ed",
          "Famous tourist spot in Barcelona. We paid 29 EUR for entrance tickets which is expensive for single traveller and very dissuasive for a family. You can save 4 EUR by internet booking but you will need to comply with a visit time. Does it \u2026",
          "Amazing building from outside and inside. Gaudin thought about every unimaginable detail and put his creativity on every corner of this extraordinary house.",
          "Another masterpiece by Gaudi, simply amazing!",
          "One of my favorite places in BCN",

          "It's very original building, wouldn't bother to go inside of the ques and amount of people there, but as an architectural project is beautiful",
          "Fantastic place to visit that gives an insight to Gaudi's design style",
          "Lovely unique character. What a treasure to the world and to know Antoni Gaud\u00ed.",
          "For evey architect student, for every design lover, for every open mind and eyes this is place to visit. You'll have audio guide if you want to know/learn most of main informations about the house, otherwise just enjoy the details, colors and go back in time :-)",
          "Awesome house, but chock full in tourist season. Get tickets online.",
          "One if the most beautiful and fascinating homes ever to visit.  The interactive virtual tours that let visitors look into the past was wonderful\n  Don't miss this along with the cathedral.",

          "It's being renovated, so not how it should be",
          "Fantastic example of Gaudi's finest work. The house itself is beautiful, and it's easy to get a good view as it's on the main road just beyond the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. \n\nThere was a queue to get in but the waiting time wasn't very long. \u2026",
          "I honestly didn't go inside. But it is a really good view from outside.",

        "wiki": "Casa Mil\u00e0 (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8kaz\u0259 mi\u02c8la], Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8kasa mi\u02c8la]), popularly known as La Pedrera (pronounced [\u026b\u0259 p\u0259\u02c8\u00f0\u027ee\u027e\u0259]) or \"The stone quarry\", a reference to its unconventional rough-hewn appearance, is a modernist building in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was the last private residence designed by architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed and was built between 1906 and 1912.\nThe building was commissioned in 1906 by Pere Mil\u00e0 and his wife Roser Segimon. At the time, it was controversial because of its undulating stone facade, twisting wrought iron balconies and designed by Josep Maria Jujol. Several structural innovations include a self-supporting stone fa\u00e7ade, and a free-plan floor, underground garage and the spectacular terrace on the roof.\nIn 1984, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since 2013 it has been the headquarters of the Fundaci\u00f3 Catalunya La Pedrera which manages the visit to the building, exhibitions and other cultural and educative activities at Casa Mil\u00e0.\n\n\n== Building history ==\n\n\n=== Architect ===\nAntoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet was born on June 25, 1852 in Catalonia Spain. As a child, Gaud\u00ed's health was poor, suffering from rheumatism. Because of this, he was afforded lengthy periods of time resting at his summer house in Riudoms. Here he spent a large portion of his time outdoors, allowing him to deeply study nature. This would become one of the major influences in his architecture to come.\nGaud\u00ed was a very practical man and a craftsman at his core. In his work he followed impulses and turned creative plans into reality. His openness to embrace new styles combined with a vivid imagination helped mold new styles of architecture and consequently helped push the limits of construction. Today he is regarded as a pioneer of the modern architecture style.In 1870, Gaud\u00ed moved to Barcelona to study architecture. He was an inconsistent student who showed flashes of brilliance. It took him eight years to graduate due to a mix of health complications, military service as well as other activities.After completion of his education he became a prolific architect as well as designing gardens, sculptures and all other decorative arts. Gaud\u00ed's most famous works consisted of several buildings: Parque G\u00fcell; Palacio G\u00fcell; Casa Mila; Casa Vicens. He also is contributed for his work on the Crypt of La Sagrada Familia and the Nativity facade. Gaud\u00ed's work at the time was both admired and criticized for his bold, innovative solutions.Gaud\u00ed's life came to a tragic end when he was run over by a trolleybus. A few weeks later he died in the hospital due to his injuries on June 10, 1926 at the age of 74. A few years after his death, his fame became renowned by critics and the general public alike\n\n\n=== Building owners ===\n\nCasa Mil\u00e0 was built for Roser Segim\u00f3n and her husband Pere Mil\u00e0. Roser Segim\u00f3n was the wealthy widow of Josep Guardiola, an Indiano or Americano, or former colonist returned from South America, had made his fortune with a coffee plantation in Guatemala. Her second husband, Pere Mil\u00e0 was a developer known for his flamboyant lifestyle.\n\n\n=== Construction process ===\n\nIn 1905, Mil\u00e0 and Segim\u00f3n married and on June 9, Roser Segim\u00f3n bought a house with garden which occupied an area of 1,835 square meters, located on Paseo de Gracia, 92. In September, they commissioned Gaud\u00ed for building them a new house with the idea of living in the main floor and renting out the rest of the apartments. On February 2, 1906, the project was presented to the Barcelona City Council and the works began, demolishing the pre-existing building instead of reforming it, as in the case of the Casa Batll\u00f3.The building was completed in December 1910 and the owner asked Gaud\u00ed to make a certificate to inhabit the main floor, which the City Council authorized in October 1911, and the couple moved in. On October 31, 1912, Gaud\u00ed issued the certificate stating that, in accordance with his plans and his direction, the work had been completed and the whole house was ready to be rented.\n\n\n=== Critics and controversies ===\nThe building did not respect any rules of conventional style, for which Gaud\u00ed received much criticism. To begin with, the name \"La Pedrera\" is in fact a nickname assigned by the citizens who disapproved of its unusualness. The unique structure of the building and the relationship between the building's architect and Pere Mil\u00e0 became the object of ridicule for the people of Barcelona and many humorous publications of the time.\n\n\n==== Catholic symbols ====\n\nGaud\u00ed, a Catholic and a devotee of the Virgin Mary, planned for the Casa Mil\u00e0 to be a spiritual symbol. Overt religious elements include an excerpt from the Rosary on the cornice and planned statues of Mary, specifically Our Lady of the Rosary, and two archangels, St. Michael and St. Gabriel.However, the Casa Mil\u00e0 was not built entirely to Gaud\u00ed's specifications. The local government ordered the demolition of elements that exceeded the height standard for the city, and fined the Mil\u00e0s for many infractions of building codes. After Semana Tr\u00e1gica, an outbreak of anticlericalism in the city, Mil\u00e0 prudently decided to forgo the religious statues. Gaud\u00ed contemplated abandoning the project but a priest persuaded him to continue.\n\n\n=== Change of ownership ===\n\nIn 1940, Mil\u00e0 died. Segimon sold the property in 1946 for 18 million pesetas to Josep Ballv\u00e9 i Pellis\u00e9, known for his department stores on Ronda de Sant Antoni, in partnership with the family of P\u00edo Rubert Laporta. The Compa\u00f1\u00eda Inmobiliaria Provenza, SA (CIPSA) was founded to administer the building. Roser Segimon continued to live on the main floor until her death in 1964.\n\nThe new owners divided the first floor facing Carrer de Proven\u00e7a into five apartments instead of the original two. In 1953, they commissioned Francisco Juan Barba Corsini to convert 13 rubbish-filled attic laundry rooms to street-facing apartments, leaving a communal hallway on the side facing the courtyards. Some of these two or three room apartments had a loft and were designed and furnished in a typical early 1950s style using brick, ceramic and wood. Items of furniture, such as the Pedrera chair, were reminiscent of Eero Saarinen's work.The insurance company Northern took over the main floor in 1966. By then, Casa Mil\u00e0 had housed a bingo hall, an academy and the offices of Cementos Molins and Inoxcrom among others. Maintenance costs were high and the owners had allowed the building to become dilapidated, causing stones to loosen in 1971. Josep Anton Comas made some emergency repairs, especially to the paintings in the courtyards, while respecting the original design.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nGaud\u00ed's work was designated a historic and artistic monument on July 24, 1969. Casa Mil\u00e0 was in poor condition in the early 1980s. It had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate, but it has been restored since and many of the original colors revived.In 1984 the building became part of a World Heritage Site encompassing some of Gaud\u00ed's works. The Barcelonan city council tried to rent the main floor as an office for the 1992 Olympic bid. Finally, the day before Christmas 1986, Caixa Catalunya bought La Pedrera for 900 million pesetas. On February 19, 1987, urgently needed work began on the restoration and cleaning of the fa\u00e7ade. The work was done by the architects Joseph Emilio Hern\u00e1ndez-Cross and Rafael Vila. The renovated main floor opened in 1990 as part of the Cultural Olympiad of Barcelona. The floor became an exhibition room with an example of modernism in the Eixample.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe building is 1,323 m2 per floor on a plot of 1,620 m2. Gaud\u00ed made the first sketches in his workshop in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. He designed the house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating ruled geometry and naturalistic elements.\n\nCasa Mil\u00e0 consists of two buildings, which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine stories: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main (or noble) floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Mil\u00e0s (a flat of all 1,323 m2), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical \"8\" because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof.\nOne of the most notable elements of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed out of brick covered with lime, broken marble, or glass have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building.\nThe apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, as well as hydraulic tiles and various ornamental elements.\nThe stairways were intended as service entries, with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaud\u00ed added a prominent interior staircase. Gaud\u00ed wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only elevators on every other floor, so people on different floors would meet one another.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nCasa Mil\u00e0 is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of load-bearing walls. The facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes.\n\n\n=== Constructive and decorative items ===\n\n\n==== Facade ====\nThe facade is composed of large blocks of limestone from the Garraf Massif on the first floor and from the Villefranche quarry for the higher levels. The blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model, then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them.\nViewed from the outside the building has three parts: the main body of the six-storey blocks with winding stone floors, two floors set a block back with a different curve, similar to waves,  a smoother texture and whiter color, and with small holes that look like embrasures, and finally the body of the roof.Gaud\u00ed's original facade had some of its lower-level ironwork removed. In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, and he eliminated the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, wrought ironwork had little importance. The ironwork was lost until a few years later, when Americans donated one of them to the MoMa, where it is on display.\nWith restoration initiatives launched in 1987, the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen. In order to respect the fidelity of the original, material was obtained from the Villefranche quarry, even though by then it was no longer operating.\n\n\n==== Hall and courtyards ====\nThe building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark. Its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building. There are two patios on the side of the Passeig de Gracia and of the street Provence.\n\nPatios\nPatios, structurally, are key as supporting loads of interior facades. The floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of cast iron. In the courtyard, there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but Gaud\u00ed applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams, like the spokes of a bicycle. They form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below, making the function of the central girder a keystone and working in tension and compression simultaneously. This supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered \"the soul of the building\" with a clear resemblance to Gothic crypts. The centerpiece was built in a shipyard by Josep Maria Carandell who copied a steering wheel, interpreting Gaud\u00ed's intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life.\n\nInterior, gates\nAccess is protected by a massive iron gate with a design attributed to Jujol. It was originally used by both people and cars, as access to the garage is in the basement, now an auditorium.\nThe two halls are fully polychrome with oil paintings on the plaster surfaces, with eclectic references to mythology and flowers.\nDuring construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars, the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time. The future neighbor Felix Anthony Meadows, owner of Industrial Linera, requested a change because his Rolls Royce could not access it. Gaud\u00ed agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that Felix, who was establishing sales and factory in Walls of Valles, could go to both places with his car from La Pedrera.For the floors of Casa Mil\u00e0, Gaud\u00ed used a model of floor forms of square timbers with two colors, and the hydraulic pavement hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the Batllo house. The wax was designed in gray by John Bertrand under the supervision of Gaud\u00ed who \"touched up with their own fingers,\" in the words of the manufacturer Josep Bay.\n\n\n==== Loft ====\n\nLike in Casa Batll\u00f3, Gaud\u00ed shows the application of the catenary arch as a support structure for the roof, a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of Matar\u00f3's cooperative known as \"L'Obrera Mataronense.\" In this case, Gaud\u00ed used the Catalan technique of timbrel, imported from Italy in the fourteenth century.\nThe attic, where the laundry rooms were located, was a clear room under a Catalan vault roof supported by 270 parabolic vaults of different heights and spaced by about 80 cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.\nThe builder Bay\u00f3 explained its construction: \"First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. Then Canaleta indicated the opening of each arch and Bay\u00f3 put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering, and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks. Gaud\u00ed wanted to add a longitudinal axis of bricks connecting all vaults at their keystones\".\n\n\n==== Roof and chimneys ====\n\nThe work of Gaud\u00ed on the rooftop of La Pedrera brought his experience at Palau G\u00fcell together with solutions that were clearly more innovative \u2013 this time creating shapes and volumes with more body, more prominence, and less polychromasia.On the rooftop there are six skylights/staircase exits (four of which were covered with broken pottery and some that ended in a double cross typical of Gaud\u00ed), twenty-eight chimneys in several groupings, two half-hidden vents whose function is to renew the air in the building, and four domes that discharged to the facade. The staircases also house the water tanks; some of which are snail-shaped.\nThe stepped roof of La Pedrera, called \"the garden of warriors\" by the poet Pere Gimferrer because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights, has undergone a radical restoration, removing chimneys added in interventions after Gaud\u00ed, television antennas, and other elements that degraded the space. The restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of marble and broken Valencia tiles. One of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces \u2013 it was said that Gaud\u00ed did that the day after the inauguration of the building, taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party. It was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century. The repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from Ulldecona with fragments of tiles. This whole set is more colorful than the facade, although here the creamy tones are dominant.\n\n\n==== Furniture ====\n\nGaud\u00ed, as he had done in Casa Batll\u00f3, designed furniture specifically for the main floor. This was part of the concept artwork itself integral to modernism in which the architect assumed responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade, as well as every detail of the decor, designing furniture and accessories such as lamps, planters, floors or ceilings.\nThis was another point of friction with Segimon, who complained that there was no straight wall to place her Steinway piano. Gaud\u00ed's response was blunt: \"So play the violin.\"  The result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of Gaud\u00ed, as most of the furniture was removed due to climate change and the changes she made to the main floor when Gaud\u00ed died. Some remain in private collections, including a curtain made of oak 4 m. long by 1.96 m. high in the Museum of Catalan Modernism; and a chair and desktop of Mil\u00e0.Gaud\u00ed carved oak doors similar to what he had done for the Casa y Bardes, but these were only included on two floors as when Segimon discovered the price, she decided there would be no more at that quality.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nCasa Mil\u00e0 is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\". It was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar biomorphic appearance:\n\nthe 1921 Einstein Tower in Potsdam, designed by Erich Mendelsohn\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, New York, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright\nChapelle Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, France, designed by Le Corbusier\nthe Hundertwasserhaus and other works by Austrian architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser\nDisney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, by Frank GehryFree exhibitions often are held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the fourth floor and the roof. The other floors are not open to visitors.\n\n\n=== Constructive similarities ===\nGaud\u00ed's La Pedrera was inspired by a mountain, but there is no agreement as to which mountain was the reference model. Joan Berg\u00f3s thought it was the rocks of Fray Guerau in Prades mountains. Joan Matamala thought that the model could have been St. Miquel del Fai, while the sculptor Vicente Vilarubias believed it was inspired by the cliffs Torrent Pareis in Menorca. Other options include the mountains of U\u00e7hisar in Cappadocia, suggested by Juan Goytisolo, or Mola Gallifa, suggested by Louis Permanyer, based on the fact that Gaud\u00ed visited the area in 1885 to escape an outbreak of cholera in Barcelona.Some people say that the interior layout of La Pedrera comes from studies that Gaud\u00ed made of medieval fortresses. This image is reinforced by the seeming appearance of the rooftop chimneys as \"sentinels\" with great helmets. The structure of the iron door in the lobby does not follow any symmetry, straight or repetitive pattern. Rather, it evokes bubbles of soap that are formed between the hands or the structures of a plant cell.\n\n\n== Criticism and controversy ==\n\nThe building's unconventional style made it the subject of much criticism. It was given the nickname \"La Pedrera\", meaning \"the quarry\". Casa Mil\u00e0 appeared in many satirical magazines. Joan Junceda presented it as a traditional \"Easter cake\" by means of cartoons in Patufet. Joaquim Garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine. Homeowners in Passeig de Gracia became angry with Mil\u00e0 and ceased to greet him, arguing that the weird building by Gaud\u00ed would lower the price of land in the area.\n\n\n=== Administrative problems ===\nCasa Mil\u00e0 also caused some administrative problems. In December 1907 the City Hall stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk, not respecting the alignment of facades. Again on August 17, 1908, more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). The Council called for a fine of 100,000 pesetas (approximately 25% of the cost of work) or for the demolition of the attic and roof. The dispute was resolved a year and a half later, December 28, 1909, when the Commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a 'strict compliance' with the bylaws.\n\n\n=== Design competitions ===\nThe owner entered La Pedrera in the annual Barcelona Artistic Buildings Competition sponsored by the Barcelona City Council (Ayuntament). Other entries in the competition included two works by Sagnier (Calle Mallorca 264, and one on Corsica and Av. Diagonal), the Casa Gust\u00e0 by architect Jaume Gust\u00e0, and the Casa P\u00e9rez Samanillo, designed by Joan Josep Herv\u00e0s. Although the most dramatic and clear favorite was Casa Mil\u00e0, the jury opined that even though the facades were complete, \"there's still a lot left to do before it's fully completed, finalized and in a perfect state of appreciation.\" The winner in 1910 was Samanillo Perez, for his building which now houses the headquarters of the [1] Circulo Ecuestre.\n\n\n=== Design disagreements ===\nGaud\u00ed's relations with Segimon deteriorated during the construction and decoration of the house. There were many disagreements between them, one example was the monumental bronze virgin del Rosario, which Gaud\u00ed wanted as the statue on the front of the building in homage to the name of the owner, that the artist Carles Mani i Roig was to sculpt. The statue was not made although the words \"Ave gratia M plena Dominus tecum\" were written at the top of the facade. Continuing disagreements led Gaud\u00ed to take Mil\u00e0 to court over his fees. The lawsuit was won by Gaud\u00ed in 1916, and he gave the 105,000 pesetas he won in the case to charity, stating that \"the principles mattered more than money.\" Mil\u00e0 was having to pay the mortgage.After Gaud\u00ed's death in 1926, Segimon got rid of most of the furniture that Gaud\u00ed had designed and covered over parts of Gaud\u00ed's designs with new decorations in the style of Louis XVI. La Pedrera was acquired in 1986 by Caixa Catalunya and when restoration was done four years later, some of the original decorations re-emerged.When the Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Mil\u00e0s were on vacation. Part of the building was collectivized by the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia; the Mil\u00e0s fled the area with some artwork.\n\n\n== In media and literature ==\nA scene in The Passenger (Italian: Professione: reporter), a film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and starring Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider, was filmed on the roof of the building.\nA scene filmed on the roof in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, directed by Woody Allen.\nMentioned in the book by Eoin Colfer: Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony\nMentioned in the book by Trudi Alexy 'The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot'\nMentioned in the 'Ballrooms and Biscotti' episode (season 4, episode 1) of Gilmore Girls\nSeveral scenes in the movie, Gaudi Afternoon\nA scale model exhibited at the Catalunya en Miniatura park.\nFeatured in the music video for Deep Forest's 'Sweet Lullaby'\nThe home of Edmond Kirsch in Dan Brown's novel Origin, the 5th book featuring Robert Langdon.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Modernisme buildings in Barcelona\nDan Brown: Origin\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRainer Zervst.

          "I liked this better than Casa Batillo but still found it kind of interesting and boring at the same time. You only need to go to one of these (either Batillo or Mila). Seems kind of repetitive and boring to go to both. No line in February.",
          "Casa Mila is beautiful, one of my favourite architecture in Barcelona. It is very worth checking out. The view from the top is gorgeous",
          "Looking at Casa Mil\u00e0 from the outside, it looks like a house shaped by sea waves. On the ground floor, there is a gate that made me wonder how someone made such a gate. In fact, everything there is impressive, because there are so many curves, that I wonder how everything was",
          "All of the pics I've seen are of the outside of the building and the roof. All of which is great. But it was what we saw in the attic that was impressive. I always wondered where Gaudi found inspiration and I learned it here, and more about the architect.",
          "My husband and I were in Barcelona in 2010 and didn't make it here, so when we came back in 2020 we knew we had to go. It definitely did not disappoint. Our 8 year old son also loved it.",
          "Very interesting and beautiful building, one of the most famous architectural construction. Positioned near the center.",
          "It was wonderful to finally get a look inside this famous building. It is a unique look at a different side of Gaudi. The real show stopper is the roof, it is gorgeous! We had the opportunity to visit at night for a light show and then the following day. Gaudi's rooftop",
          "During my time in Barcelona the work of Antoni Gaudi was breathtaking regardless of the scale. This included this unique building with the \u201cwavy\u201d features that was originally built as a private residence. The wrought iron railings and balconies add to the modernist architecture",
          "Once again on of Gaudi's amazing creations. Great architect and amazing as a building. Throughout the pictures it's not that easy to understand how magic is the whole scenery. Just amazing.",
          "This wasn't on our original schedule to visit but having been blow away by Casa Battlo it was a no brainer to squeeze either this or Park Guell in on the small amount of time we had nothing planned (Park guell was ruled out due to distance and time needed there). We walked",
          "It's always interesting to see a lot of people staring the modernists buildings at Passeig de Gr\u00e1cia, anytime. La Casa Mil\u00e1 is the fusion of the unregular shape of the stones with the harmony of the modernist architecture.",
          "The best place to go to learn more about the thoughts and inspirations behind Gaudi's works! More than being just works of art, Gaudi ensured that his works were created in a manner that was purposeful and functional. A truly informative experience and the audioguide is a",
          "This is one of the major 'Gaudi' must sees in Barcelona. How forwarded thinking to be allowed to build such an amazing architectural building back in the day. The rooftop and the chimneys are just amazing",
          "World Heritage site off Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia boulevard this is Gaud\u00ed's secular building in avant-garde style resembling a stone quarry. It is a work of sculpture. All lines of the grey natural stone fa\u00e7ade are curved, with rounded windows and wrought iron balcony railings twining",
          "The highlight of this tour, to me, was the rooftop, where the tour began. It is anything but level! You must watch your step. Some of the \"chimneys\" reminded me of Star Wars Storm Troopers. I found it fascinating. My husband disliked the style of architecture intensely. He",
          "A fun example of Gaudi architecture. We just were walking in the area and did not go in or examine it too closely.",
          "What on earth did the architect have in mind when he built that? It is a uniquely style with all the curvy balconies.",
          "This house build by Antoni Gaudi is a beautiful piece of architecture. Strongly recommend everyone to see this house when you are in Barcelona! it is also very close to Casa Batll\u00f3",
          "This is just across street from the other stunning building, it is just amazing is in the middle of busy avenue.",
          "Of the two Guadi houses near each other we preferred this one, there\u2019s more to see and the smart audio guide works well sensing where you are in the building. The rooms that are furnished and decorated give more of a sense of these buildings as they were originally used and",
          "For anyone who is a little culturally interested, this building by Antoni Gaudi is part of a visit to Barcelona. Already a great sight from the outside. However, it has much more to offer. The view from the roof of the building, as well as the architecture inside the building.",
          "It is a very beautiful house and worth to see, but I just have to say that paying 27 Euros is way too much. We payed less for the Sagrada fam\u00edlia which is a monumental scructure still being built, while Casa Mila is already finished. I really think the price is ridiculous.",
          "Intriguing location with impressive history. Expensive but memorable. The headphones were a nice addition that activated automatically throughout the facility.",
          "Quite an unique design and viewing it closer, it looks quite a piece of art. Designed by Antoni Gaudi was build during the period 1906 till 1916. There is a lot of art work into the structure, the floors are waving, the railing are so different with metal designs. One cannot",
          "We went at night and got to see the light show on the roof. Highly recommend it was very cool! Great views from the roof as well.",
          "This is another must see. A little on the expensive side but another great example of Gaud\u00ed s imagination. Views from the roof are great and the workmanship on the roof and in the loft are stunning.",
          "Loved it and the audio guide was cool. The first place you enter is quite a nice place for photos, you can then go to a few floors. The top floor where all the sculptures are, the 'attic' which is a really cool museum where you learn many fascinating things about Gaudi and see",
          "Another lovely place to visit. So much to see in here. His furniture and doors are amazing. More quirkiness.",
          "Walking into the building, especially going to the roof and the attic, it is difficult to imagine people living in the building - even though there are still several families living in apartments. The wavy architecture and design were amazing, and highlight for me was the attic",
          "I passed by this apartment building back in 1998 (my last trip to Barcelona), but never ventured inside. Seeing the inside was one of the reasons I returned to the city. Was it worth the more than two decade wait? Absolutely! Using the included virtual audio guide was brilliant.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit. Spectacural roof top and chimneys like guards. Very imaginative architecture and yet an apartment house. Definitely a masterpiece of it\u2019s kind.",
          "Lovely and so much quieter than the Fam\u00edlia. Lovely views from the roof and each level stunning in its own way. Well worth a visit",
          "This building is situated near to main fashion shops. The curved shape is tipical to Gaud\u00ed stile with grey surface since no colour have been used to decorate the main building. Lines are clean and immediate.",
          "The tour was such a fun experience. Getting to actually be inside the building and see his work was very worth the time and the money. I love that the building is actually still occupied with residents.",
          "This is a must see for anyone in the building industry. The focus on design and the ability to build is fantastic. well worth the price of admission",
          "This was an excellent choice to see. An amazing example of Gaudi's work start to finish. The apartment and the roof are the most detailed highlights.",
          "A visit to La Pedrera provides an opportunity to see the genius of Gaudi in an every day object - a place where you could live.. not a right-angle to be found.. magic!",
          "It was a long queue so couldn't enter because we needed to visit other places too, instead, we admired the exterior. Beautiful.",
          "I went to La Pedrera today with my fiancee and we were mesmerized by the beautiful architecture all around. All the nature like symbols, walls and sculptures - divine! And the roof was the best part of it. Great spot for contemplation. And you can see the Sagrada Familia as",
          "We have visited the other Gaudi\u2019s building Casa Battlo in our previous visit. Although there are some similarities in style between the two, Casa Mila is much larger project on a totally different scale. We were lucky with the weather as it was very sunny and bright day. This",
          "...if there is such a list, that is. \"Fascinating\" is the word that comes to mind. Skipping the line by buying on-line will save you some Euros - never mind the time saved. Since each Gaudi building is more amazing than the last, just plan to see them all. Casa Mila is no",
          "I could have spent hours sitting on the roof, it did for me what he designed it for, relaxing. I cannot get over how forward thinking he was.",
          "We took our teenage grandson here in the evening during half term He really enjoyed hearing the stories and the music/light show on the roof. It was over priced for what you actually see during the evening visit but was an interesting experience. Beforehand we enjoyed a",
          "My wife booked the night experience tour which included the meal at the cafe on the first floor. The meal was a four course meal which was inclusive of drinks. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal in the Cafe, which in itself was stunning. Then we headed down stairs to start our tour.",
          "Fabulous building, audio cover just enough to be informative without being boring. The building feels as though it is breathing.",
          "Bought the tickets online just the day before very easily and chose a time slot that suited us. No delays getting through and picked up audio guides that auto changed as you moved through the different areas of the building. There is a lift to the roof and you return via stairs",
          "We were able to leave our strollers in the lockers and walk up with the kids . There was also audio guide for adults and even the kids",
          "Is a nice place to visit when you visit Barcelona because is in the city center. I really had a good time there. Easy to get there with tram and metro bus.",
          "We booked the 8am tour of Le Pedrera with the extremely informative and entertaining Arcadi guiding us around this magnificent building. The tour only had 7 of us and as the building was not open to the public yet, some great opportunities for photos. The tour includes access to",
          "I did not personally experience this tour. However, several tourists we met recommended the night tour experience and said it was a must do. Gaudi\u2019s architecture is inspired by nature and a unique experience. Sorry we missed it. Next time!",
          "The admission is a little high at 27\u20ac, but 45% is used for maintenance of the building/museum and the balance is contributed to a fund that takes care of underprivileged people. Like all of Gaud\u00ed works, the outside has a lot going on and the inside is simple. The rooftop was",
          "Our tour guide was phenomenal, knowledgeable on the history and also funny. Great way to see Casa Mila!",
          "Night light show on the terrace was worth seeing. Guide was very good and there was an option of the lift or 7 flights of stairs! Highly recommended",
          "This is a iconic land mark in Barcelona and again we have looked as passed but this time thought we must go in and we were glad we did the whole building tells a story and the views are to die for",
          "The kids loved it here. It\u2019s such a functional building and has a charm all of its own. The view from the rooftops is stunning. Worth a visit.",
          "Well worth a visit if you go to just one Gaud\u00ed house. Take the lift to the roof as you see nothing on the stairs on the way up. If you struggle with heights beware of the relatively low external wall on the roof terrace. The apartment is a good snapshot of life for the well to",
          "One of the fine examples of Gaudi\u2019s work in apartment design. Interesting detail in the courtyard, but the most fascinating element was his use of art to create a rooftop landscape that hid the chimneys, and his amazing use of light to create a feeling of openness. I used the",
          "Did not purchase a ticket to go in but definitely enjoyed walking around the outside! Many public monuments and sights throughout Spain require an entrance fee (which may be indicative of the Spanish economy - 14% unemployment) and often have long lines to get in unless you",
          "I have to say, all of gaudis work is a masterpiece! How could someone at that time in life, make something so spectacular! His stuff still is the most epic architecture to date... everything looks like it could be made in the next 300-500 years!",
          "Casa Mil\u00e0, also known as La Pedrera, was Gaudi's final work before he dedicated himself to Sagrada Familia. It is being classified as one of his most quintessential works ever! What makes Casa Mil\u00e0 special is it pays attention to every detail of Gaudi's genius organic",
          "It's an amazing building as expected, entertaining stories and details. We had the night tour, surely fascinating, but we expected to be able to visit a bit more. On the whole, despite understanding the costs for maintenance, it's a bit pricey.",
          "This one of most beautiful places in the world. Glad I visited this place. I met with my old friend use to work together in state and stay in few area around the cities. Amazing and memorable visit",
          "Really quite disappointed with our visit to la pedrera, we followed the audio guide and were in and out inside an hour. Between tour groups and school groups it was too busy, I felt like I was in someone's way wherever I was. The rooftop view is nice but not great. The audio",
          "It was night when my our flight arrived in Barcelona. We try to find a place that still open, then we find Casa Mila. I have to say the light show on the roof of Casa Mila is awsome!! The design of this building, especially the desigh of roof is the priceless treasure that",
          "We went on the night tour of Casa Mila. It was great but the group was too large, by the time the last person was in the new destination the guide was already into her presentation, We tended to miss a lot. I believe that a bit smaller group would have been better, it was",
          "I learned so much about Gaudi and visited so many sites and could never grow tired of it. Creative genius. The rooftop does seem otherworldly. I suggest spending extra for the open ticket. you can go anytime and skip the very long lineup - totally worth it.",
          "Interesting insight into Gaudi's thinking. The audio tour is atmospheric but also full of information.",
          "Very impressive and really unique. The entrance fees are too high.Nice shop with a lot of things you won't find elsewhere.",
          "The first full day in Barcelona, we opted to take our own walking tour and ended up at Casa Mila. We sprung for the immediate entrance tickets rather than the cheaper timed tickets since we didn't want to have to come back. They have you start on the roof and work your way",
          "The building may not be for all, but it is well worth visiting for the wonderful exhibition at the attic gallery space, which explores and explains Gaudi's design concepts and inspiration under the brick arches.",
          "The roof was tremendous and the thought behind the chimneys and arcs. The arcs framing the Sagrada Familia and Tibidabo were a highlight for photography. We started at the top and descended the building through servants quarters and domestic areas. The story boards conveyed a",
          "this is a master pieces. you must go see it. definitely buy skip the line ticket, its worth it. The roof top is spectacular. you can spend lots of time taking photos.",
          "We didn\u2019t go in here (tickets are available for some sort of interior experience though). So this is just a short review on walking by and stopping to see it. Basically, in a city full of cool and unique buildings, this one manages to stand out and is worth checking out, even if",
          "Casa Mila is a very interesting building, but of all the Gaudi sites in Barcelona, it was the one I felt I could have skipped. It seemed to me like a really nice apartment with some extra flourishes.",
          "Another masterpiece by Gaud\u00ec, not as beautiful as Casa Battlo, but still worth seeing, for it's uniqueness.",
          "No major queue in January ...when we visited..but the house was busy. You start your tour on the very top floor of the attic and rooftop. Lots and lots of stairs but there is a lift...best ask on arrival. Worth the climb though for spectacular views and amazing detail of the",
          "Gaudi was a true genius, the house is impressive on the outside and inside. all you can visit here is impressive, so it is also a must when in Barcelona.",
          "I really recommend to visit Casa la Pedrera, all the Gaudi creations are a life experience more than architectural structures. This stop have to be included in you trip!",
          "This is a must visit in Barcelona. A masterpiece by Gaudi. Highlight is definitely the rooftop. Audio guide was very helpful. Make sure you book tickets online in advance. It\u2019s not as crowded as I expected, maybe because we got in during the earliest time slot.",
          "We loved our stop here. It is crazy how it just settles into the block. Worth a stop and an look! We ate lunch with a view of this beautiful building!",
          "This a beautiful house and the price of the ticket was worth it if you love Gaudi and how his brain worked. The roof of this building is stunning and indescribable. If there is a possibility of going you should make the time.",
          "I finally made it to La Pedrera after countless trips to Barcelona. Why did I wait so long?? This is a must see and the rooftop is indescribable. Don\u2019t hesitate, pay the entrance fee and just go see it! You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "Debated about visiting Casa Mila and/or Casa Batllo\u2019 as tickets are pretty pricey. Ended up choosing Casa Mila because it was designed from \u201cground up\u201d by Gaudi and also includes some furnishings whereas Casa Batllo was a renovation. Audio guide was helpful and available in an",
          "A strange building but a satisfying tour around. The audio commentary was clear and very good quality and the rooftop and furnished room was very good",
          "This is the most amazing building i ever saw. And turns out that is from the last century. It is crowded, but the waiting is worth it. I won't anticipate what you are gonna find in there, just go and visit yourself Don't miss it. It's a must if you are in Barcelona",
          "Unfortunately it was a wet, very windy day and the terrace was closed. But that was okay for we still enjoyed our visit. Gaudi was brilliant and we have seen some other of his designs on this trip. I was amazed how he took natural shapes and incorporated them into his work. The",
          "We unfortunately went on a very rainy night, but it was still beautiful and the light was was nice how it was all done even in he rain",
          "This is lovely from the outside, but the tour is worth it as well if you appreciate architecture. You'll learn a lot about Gaudi and his works. A great view of the city from the roof.",
          "Last time my husband and I were in Barcelona (22 years ago), we saw La Pedrera but could not go in. Finding out that you could now do a self-guided tour was a reason we choose Barcelona again. The roof, with it's chimneys and towers, was mesmerizing! Worth the wait!",
          "My husband and I came here for a self-guided tour and really enjoyed this unique building. We especially like the roof and it\u2019s towers. Gaudi was a genius in his designs and we really like this place.",
          "Lovely building, very expensive to enter and look round. You can see enough without going in and looking round.",
          "Yet another Gaudi marvel. The rooftop chimneys are imposing and incredible. The museum demonstrates Gaudi's love of nature and his vision for his masterpieces such as Sagrada Familia. The building itself is on a street amongst shops, and if it wasn't for the intrivate external",
          "It has been several years since my previous visit. This time with my husband was a new and exciting experience. Both of us really enjoyed the roof, the attic, and the apartment. My husband's favorite was the roof. We were lucky with the weather and few tourists. My favorite was",
          "It was worth while going. The architecture was amazing. The roof top was spectacular. Definitely get tickets ahead of time. The audio is a must.",
          "Beautiful looking building, Shame buildings aren\u2019t as beautiful as this any more. Defo worth a look if the weather is nice",
          "So, I fell out with Google Maps while walking from Parc Guell to the Casa Mila. Google Maps took me to somewhere near by but not the building and not this street. I've put the name of the street as the title so you only need to find the street and you will eventually find the",
          "We bought tickets online for the standard tour which included the audio guide, which was good. The tour starts in the lovely courtyard of the building. It\u2019s amazing how everything is unique in this building- there is no symmetry. The next stop is the level just below the roof.",
          "Beautiful architecture and less busy than Casa Battlo. Slightly expensive but worth it considering an audio guide is included. If you enjoy Gaudi\u2019s style youll enjoy your visit. I personally loved it!",
          "We booked the night experience and were thoroughly disappointed. Our tour guide wasn't engaged at all with what she was saying, most of which is a rehash of what you'll hear and read at every other Gaudi site. Some of the tour feels like a gimmick to mask the fact that most of",
          "Visit and the roof top show is not a bad way to wind up your evening. We weren't disappointed but slightly underwhelmed. Maybe our expectations from the reputation of this place was higher than what it is. Still, worth the visit for the originality.",
          "Casa Mila is bigger than Casa Batlio, but not as good looking from outside. It looks somewhat ordinary except for the lighting and teh crowd. Only exception being the balcony railings - which are of irregular shape.",
          "The audio tour and displays do an amazing job of explaining Gaudi's approach to architecture to the curious novice. It's a must-do before seeing the Sagrada Familia. Splurge on the Premium tickets form the site's website. You are whisked to a separate security check and front",
          "Go at sunset, and watch the sun setting over the ventilation shafts on the rooftop. Then take your time exploring the attic and apartments and get a feel as to how people lived in the 1920s.",
          "We came to this after visiting Familia Sagrada. This amazing building and the excellent audio guide gives you a real insight into the genius of Gaudi, a man way ahead of his times. We did a tour of the Familia Sagrada and the guide spent lots of time talking about bible stories.",
          "When you attend the night experience, you will not see the apartments with the furnitures, you will get a semi-private tour with a guide who will tell you about the building and its history. You will start at the foyer/atrium and head straight to the attic and then the roofdeck",
          "We purchased tickets through Viator for a 10:30 admission on New Years Day as we had an early afternoon train departure so we had about 90 minutes to complete the tour. When we arrived, we found out they did not open until 11:00 am (We were not the only ones sold tickets before",
          "I have become a big enthusiast over Gaudi's works and this place has so much to offer. plan on spending some time studying the roof and it's strange but awesome structures. The attic is very unusual and deserves some reverent investigating. Love this place.",
          "Our first stop off on day one, lovely staff. Good menu outside. We had a small bite 2 teas and the Coca bread, simple and nice",
          "This place is situated in a street full of shops so cannot be missed. Beautiful building to see. Unusual shape and design.",
          "One of the famous works of Gaudi in Barcelona, this beautiful building can be seen on a walk along Passeig de Gracia coming from Placa de Catalyuna.",
          "Casa Mil\u00e0 is a must visit site for anyone living or visiting Barcelona. It is the most unique, gorgeous, practical and grounding apartment building I have ever seen. Casa Mil\u00e0\u2019s attic exhibits Gaud\u00ed\u2019s thought process, his work, vision and how his work is dedicated to nature",
          "The whole tour was mesmerising! Loved the roof solders. The audio was amazing and had a good sound quality. It was run very well. The same as Casa Batlo. when you are there you don't want to leave. I went back and visited previously seen places again. A must to see when in",
          "Genius Antoni Gaud\u00ed built this fascinating building in the center of Barcelona. The audio guide is very well clear and helps to have a deeper experience. It\u2019s worth value to buy the tickets online",
          "Barcelona is full of houses, parks and monuments built by Gaudi and it is impossible to visit every one of them in a few days. La Pedrera ( meaning they Quarry, a name given to it by the inhabitants of the city) was our choice and it proved to be very interesting especially",
          "The name \"Gaudi\" should suffice. Why would anybody need 100 characters to describe. Go inside by day and by night repeat to your heart content.",
          "The audio tour for this is automatically triggered as you walk past certain tour points. While cool, if you get stuck behind a slow group or backtrack or move too quickly, you might hear the same info twice or completely miss something. It\u2019s also hard to tell how close to the",
          "Lovely way to get to know the works of Gaudi! Buy your tickets online so you don\u2019t have to wait in the long line. Takes about an hour or so to do.",
          "Seeing the building from outside is not so inspiring i just bought the entrance as frustrated from Sagrada Familia endless queue. But inside completely different story. Amazing experience lucky I went for sunset.",
          "We purchased our tickets (16.50 Euros per person senior admission) to Casa Mila, also called La Pedrera (built 1905-1910) on our walk there and were able to enter quickly. We found it even more fascinating than Casa Batllo, especially the rooms that were furnished as they would",
          "Superb audioguide which changed programme as you walked passed the different rooms. The visit to the appartements was most interesting.",
          "We were fortunate to visit during low season and the lack of crowds in the early AM allowed for some pretty easy upward gazing and picture taking. A Gaudi masterpiece indeed, but unsure if there is much need to invest the money to go inside. Just my humble opinion.",
          "Another one of gaudis amazing masterpiece. It\u2019s a really nice shape and it\u2019s weirdly fascinating too look at. Walk further away from it then look at it, it\u2019s brilliant.",
          "Easy to find and within easy walking distance from the go this pc and central area. Amazing structure from the outside and worth a visit.",
          "Did the audio tour which started on the roof. It was like an adult playground. So well thought out and original and fun to walk around on. The audio skips to where you are so if you want to do the self guided tour more quickly you can. Then we went to the attic which was huge",
          "When you been in Barcelona of course you have to visit Gaud\u00ed\u2019s buildings so I recommend you to start with casa Mila and of course the night experience!!!! You will love it \ud83d\ude0d",
          "There is a reason why this stunning creation was declared UNESCO World Heritage in 1984. This beautiful building is in Passeig de Gracia near Casa Batllo. Love the design as definitely looked more classier than other Gaudi creations (with the exception of course of the",
          "This was my favourite Gaudi built house. It had the Gaudi treatment, but a little less intense. The histrorical information of Gaudi's work was very interesting as it also gave an insight of how he formed his ideas for shapes.",
          "One of the premier attractions in Barcelona which attracts a lot of visitors so worth booking ahead, worth it for the undulating rooftop views and the unique chimneys , the street view is also photo worthy but in my opinion Casa Battlo is the better of the 2 Gaudi masterpieces",
          "This place is a must see very unusual but fantastic place quirky but planned with great detail. Go up onto the roof great views over Barcelona",
          "Situated along the Passeig de Gracia (very close to Casa Batllo) lies another of Gaudi's amazing architectures. The place right now is used as an office however some of the floors are used as a museum like experience. The housing estate was rented out before as a residence to",
          "An amazing city, La Pedrera was fascinating- so much history and information given. A must if you visit",
          "A stunning creation by the famous city architect Antony Gaudi, it is a must see place in Barcelona. Advance online ticketing shall help to save on time.",
          "Beautiful experience went for the evening dinner and tour with my husband and watched the light show on the roof it\u2019s a must do in Barcelona we loved every moment including the champagne toast at the end it was incredible from beginning to end Gaudi is a genius and this tour was",
          "A beautiful modernist building by the great architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. We did not go inside but we were able to enjoy the spectacular design from the street.",
          "It is odd to be oogling an apartment building, but the displayed genius of Gaudi in Barcelona is one of the main reasons one visits. Quite Crowded,which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it is worth going to, and worth examining the work product of a man totally beyond",
          "This is quintessential Gaudi and very well organized and maintained. It might seem a bit pricey but it is worth it with the level of detail and explanation. The automatic audio tour is excellent and executed so well you wonder why more places can\u2019t provide the same. The building",
          "Don\u2019t skip this place because you have visited Casa Batllo. This place offersa different kind of magic. It is as colourful and wonderful, bringing nature and colour to life in architecture as one has never seen before. Definitely a must see!",
          "Outside of this beautiful building is the highlight. Don\u2019t waste time going inside with rude staff. Just admire from our side. Beautiful at night as well!",
          "Very impressive how Gaud\u00ed used the natural light for interior spaces, the natural airflow within the building and the admirable space functionality",
          "My husband is a general contractor and he was completely in awe of this building. It is beautiful, innovative and a must see and experience.",
          "Casa Mila is a great piece of architecture but if you\u2019ve done casa Battlo i guess its a bit of an overkill.",
          "Beautiful place. Amazing. However, very unfriendly staff from beginning to end. They didn't want us there even though we have the most super amazing Spanish guide (not from Casa Mila).",
          "This is one of the two Gaudi designed homes on display in the great city of Barcelona \u2013 both are within around 15 minutes walk. Allow around an hour to visit and enjoy the views of the city and the building from the terrace on the roof which has many unique Gaudi designed and",
          "La Pedrera was Gaudi's last project before Sagrada Familia. It is very interesting and the self-guided audio tour is included in the admission price and worth taking",
          "Definitely buy ticket in advance and use audioguide. It's crowded on the inside and lots of stairs. It's beautiful but was not my favorite place in Barcelona.",
          "Breathtaking and so, so clever. The guided tour with the radio is brilliant, not cheap but its like nothing else, hard to explain, just go inside and its another world.",
          "What a fantastic building! I am glad we got the audio guide and went to the terrace, where some important work was done as well. Truth be told, it did feel short for the \u20ac25 paid, but it was a fantastic experience, and while I wouldn't do it again, would recommend doing it at",
          "This Gaudi building Case Mila is a must to see. Not only the insite but also the roof deck outside. You will have a mazing look at La Sagrada Familia. The campus Basilica in Barcelona.",
          "Got online tickets and skiped the line which wasn't huge in the end of November. This is another amazing masterpiece of talented architect. Audioguide makes your visit more interesting so it is worth to take it. Here you can take a look in the daily life of one family with good",
          "I only had about 5 hours' stopover in Barcelona so I went from the airport straight there because my friend recommended it to me. It took me about an hour or so to walk leisurely throughout the beautiful complex and take tons of photos. I highly recommend going there. It's",
          "WE LOVE GAUDI! Our tour guide loved him too. Absolutely stunning and fascinating behind the scenes tour of a Barcelona icon.",
          "A stunning and unique house which showcases the work of Gaudi, the rooftop is amazing with views of one of the main roads in Barcelona. You can also see Gaudi\u2019s influences that went into the roof design along with the Sagrada Familia. A must see if you are in Barcelona - around",
          "Great to see, not far from middle of the city - go and check this out as it is very interesting architecture",
          "It is definitely another worth visiting to enjoy the beauty of Gaudi's works. Yet, frankly speaking, i t was not as impressive as Casa Battlo, which I believe is the best of the best, if you are looking for his works.",
          "I purchased the combo ticket for both a self-guided-with-audio daytime admission and a nighttime guided tour and multimedia show of light and sound on the rooftop. The self-guided daytime admission was awesome, and the audio tour was informative. Touring the furnished",
          "It is worth to visit that place. You can go to roof top and enjoy the Barcelona city sightseeing with the elevation view. The marvellous architectural design can make you surprised.",
          "We took the audio tour and it really helped me to understand the reasoning and genius behind this architect. It can be rough for the disabled to deal with the uneven floors and fairly numerous stairs - but I did it and saw the accommodations made for someone in a wheelchair - so",
          "Casa Mila is indeed a unique building, very different from rest of the buildings in Barcelona or elsewhere. Gaudi conceived this design at the start of 20th century and even after more than 100 years, one doesn't come across many such buildings. It's just a 5 minutes walk from",
          "It is 5 min walk from Casa Battlo and you should see it. I didnt go inside but from outside you can also see the stormtrooper helmets on the roof.",
          "Guide was very good. The building is just wow and the light show took my breath away. Fantastic views especially with Christmas lights",
          "Guell is always beautiful. However I'd you are short on time I would recommend casa batlo instead because this is one definitely doesn't feel as spectacular as some of his other buildings.",
          "We were lucky enough to get in a night tour of the Casa Mila - La Pedrera! The rooftop light show was mesmerizing!! Do'nt miss this if you have the opportunity!!",
          "Been there so many times and always impressed like it's the first time. This time I took the evening tour which costs 38eur. Per person. It started at 1900 and the duration was an hour & a half with a \"tour\" guide who was so pleasant & interesting. The way he put it- \"let's",
          "The highlight of the Casa Mila is definitely the roof. I highly recommend the audio guide to contextualize the interior, which is interesting but not so much as the roof.",
          "Casa Mila is on Paseig de Gracia, not far from Casa Battlo. While Casa Battlo felt more 'alive' and artistic to me, Casa Mila had a better introduction into Gaudi's universe and method of building. The audioguide was however terribly uncomfortable (on the neck and ears!) and",
          "My wife booked an entry time and we had the audio guide which was perfect. Absolutely wonderful place to visit, so many interesting things to see. Only problem is that it was crowded and too many people made it difficult to get around, especially the model apartments; even worse",
          "The audio tour is great because it automatically kicks in as you cross certain thresholds. The rooftop is extraordinary, but for someone with a fear of heights, a little daunting as the outer wall is low. Gauidi's work is always fascinating. It was neat to see a recreation of",
          "We didn't regret our visit here, but it definitely was nowhere near as interesting as Gaudi's other works - Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, Parc Guell... We would visit all of those again if back in Barcelona, but would probably not come back to Casa Mila. It still had Gaudi's",
          "I highly recommend taking this tour at night. The guided tour is very informative and the architecture breathtaking. The tour ends with a light show on the roof, which was the icing on the cake, an experience I won\u2019t soon forget.",
          "Nice walk and perfect weather... Spent time enjoying the architecture, walking into different stores and a nice beer, tapas and coffee from time to time.",
          "It is something amazing. I don't want to explain how it was, just to say go there. It was like a journey through time. I recommend this place! :)",
          "#1 spot. Q-Trip: My agenda suggestion is Mil\u00e0 first, Batll\u00f3 second in one morning with Billy Brunch after ... Billy is closer to Mil\u00e0 BUT worth the walk. Q-Trip: Quite a site that needs closer to two hours than one. Batll\u00f3 can be done\u2026",
          "Was well pleased with this tour. Price was good and organized from beginning to end. Highly recommend!",

          "Did the night tour and light show at Casa Mila which is still an apartment building. It was pretty. We liked the other Gaudi buildings better than this one, though really all of his designs are so interesting and different.The light show on the roof was fun. It shows you all of",
          "Gaudi did so many amazing things in Barcelona. We only visited the outside and the shop. No time to visit the inside. Would have loved to see how the design carried to the interior",
          "Gaudi\u2019s masterpiece is truly that. Be sure to start on the roof and work down. The uniqueness of the rooftop is only topped by the scenery. There is a lot of walking and few places to sit. Working your way down into the attic and other floors gives you the sense of how",
          "Took a tour with audio guide which was the perfect way to see the castle. Lovely architecture and fascinating story - yet another feather in anton gaudi\u2019s Magical cap! The attic and roof top were stunning with wonderful views of the city as well - mountains on one side, sea on",
          "We had the self-guided audio tour, which was perfectly executed; we highly recommend that, since there are stories and details we would otherwise have missed. The audio device was synced with our location in the building, so the narration matched whatever we were looking at. The",
          "La Casa Mila is one of the must visited and due to popular visitors, pre purchase on line of your ticket is a must or you may not be able to enter and get a tours. Have good choose to climb and walk so much to see and the views from the rooftop are spectacular.",
          "I purchased my tickets online and was allowed to enter on arrival. We were provided audio guides which were interesting and well executed. The first stop is the first of two courtyards. The next stop is the terrace which is up 8 flights of steps (there is an elevator option).",
          "This building is fascinating to see and visually enjoy. Whether you are a fan of Gaudi or not, it is worth the experience of visiting and viewing his unique design and conceptual ideas. Even the street lights by this building are Gaudi designed. His works are seen in various",
          "So lovely, so interesting!! We really enjoyed our visit. Walking through the apartment took us to another time and sensibility. The finishing touches on the public spaces were photo worthy for sure. Also liked the model and explanation of how La Prefers was built.",
          "This house is what started it all. Gaudi designed and built this house and it was so different that people are still awed by it. The tour starts with a elevator ride to the roof which is amazing. The roof is a sculpture garden that runs around the center atrium of the",
          "One thing is to read about Gaudi. Another is to be touched by his creations. Casa Mila is not a place. It's an EXPERIENCE! You must visit this place.",
          "Casa Mila is located very close to the Passeig de Gracia and Diagonal metro stops. It\u2019s a lovely example of Gaudi architecture and doesn\u2019t take more than an hour (ish) to tour.",
          "Barcelona is full of these strange-looking, but beautiful houses. I didn't enter as I didn't want to spend money on this attraction, but I still enjoyed it from the outside.",
          "As noted in another review by 3citykids on TA, \"...the fencing is ugly (chain link) but some sort of protection from accidental falls is absolutely necessary. Without it, there'd be only a few inches of lip between you and a tumble into the interior courtyards.\" Well, happened",
          "Casa Mila is amazing and i truly recommend this to see! From the great architect Guadi and the old style apartment and furniture,this is a great place to start your Barcelona tours.",
          "This is an experience worthwhile to make time for in your tour through Barcelona. It certainly confirms Gaudi's brilliance!",
          "Every intersection in Barcelona is a plaza, with entrances cut at 45 degrees. And every building is filled with balconies, which we were told is a Spanish innovation. This Gaudi building is an absolute delight.",
          "La Pedrera is one of many building Ga\u00fcdi designed and built in Barcelona. Just like many of his designs, this one is strange by \u201cnormal\u201d architectural standards. Although the outside and roof are very unconventional the inside and the apartment you get to tour, seem very",
          "This building is awesome piece of architecture anywhere. The rooftop smokestacks are eerily real and seem to come to life. Couldn\u2019t stop taking pictures and just loved the views from the top. Don\u2019t miss this and spend the money to go inside",
          "The shapes of the building are so unexpected and beautiful that you should saw it. Outside and inside shape and structures are considered. It helps to imagine how many work/time Gaudi put in this design/project.",
          "I cannot recommend a tour more highly, nor a venue more elegant and sophisticated. I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND the 8AM \"before we open\" tour. Everything about the building is phenomenal: the tour and thr guide (top rate), the rooftop and attic museum, the furnished apartment, the",
          "The exterior is stunning, there is a lovely gift shop on the street level, and the tour provides a great deal of insight into Gaudi's design and elements of construction that would go unnoticed if not brought to one's attention. Fascinating display explaining how Gaudi",
          "Great creative place. We didn't enter the building but saw from outside. Beautiful place and we loved it.",
          "Although this tour of Casa Mila is quite short, it is a very personal, unique experience in a small group once the house is closed to the general public. It is a museum rather than a highly decorative house like Casa Batllo. The rooftop sound and light experience is pretty",
          "Beautiful building, although easy to miss in the busy street. Definitely worth a visit for a picture or two.",
          "I am an architectural designer so Gaudi\u2019s works are very familiar. Everyone can appreciate Sagrada Familia, next I would recommend Parc Guell as a unique escape from the city. While I personally enjoyed Casa Mila La Pedrera, if I weren\u2019t a designer I don\u2019t think the money and",
          "La Pedrera was Antoni Gaudi last creation before dedicating his time to La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Gaudi\u2019s architecture skills were beyond his time. The mosaics are breathtaking and the rooftop experience is not to be missed. It was worth spending a few hours here.",
          "Walking slowly through the rooms and stairwell and roof of this building you can enjoy Gaudi's unique organic shapes. Not to be missed",
          "The guy who gave the tour was great, friendly, interesting and willing to spend time talking to anyone about the building however the actual tour was a little disappointing. You stand in the foyer, then up to the attic, the roof for a light show and then back down to the foyer",
          "This was Gaudi's last major work before devoting himself to the Sagrada Familia and broke new ground in architecture that we take for granted nowadays. The tour included an audio guide (the English version voiced in an easy-on-the-ear Irish accent) and is highly informative but",
          "This is one of the absolute \"must see\" sights in Barcelona. It's a little expensive to visit but definitely worth it. The view from the roof is amazing and the interiors are incredible. I won't spoil it by giving away any of the details - you must see La Pedrera for yourself! By",
          "Get here early, as we did, with a prebooking to avoid the long queues, then you get to enjoy this remarkable building before it gets swamped. It may have been designed over a century ago but its organic shapes and eccentricities still feel as fresh and radical as ever. The",
          "Unusual looking apartment block. Very Gaudi. You can see the outside of it from most of the hop on / off busses",
          "Booked tickets online the day before. Audioguide included in the ticket. The roof was really fun to explore. The sculptures were exceptionally good to look at in the morning sun. You could see the Sagrada Familia from there. Enjoyed the attic where there were various exhibits",
          "My husband and I took advantage of great weather and visited Casa Mil\u00e0 on our first afternoon in Barcelona. I checked the website and saw that there were many tickets available. I purchased our tickets on my phone and received an immediate confirmation email with my tickets",
          "We toured this Gaudi apartment building at the end of a full, fun day of seeing all things Gaudi. The building has these beautiful wavy walls on the outside that make it look alive! Inside we saw the vestibule and small courtyards that bring the natural outside world into the",
          "we were told we couldn't go in because it was residential, but we saw a lot of people admiring the building from the street. If you see Casa Batllo, I don't think you have to be concerned about seeing this building from the inside.",
          "After Casa Batllo we managed to get to Casa Mila. A different, but again a very beautiful building. You can visit inside, however we were on a budget holiday and the plan was for a photo stop only. On top of that the queue was huge, so not risked with tired youngsters.",
          "i wasn't expecting to get as much out of my visit to casa mila as i did - i found both the architecture and collections on display very interesting! but what made this one of my personal highlights from barcelona was the views from the rooftop. you start your tour from the roof",
          "Another example of Gaudi's surreal architecture in the heart of the city, a bit of a trek just to see the one building, my advice is to take an open top tour bus and save your legs for Parc Guell!",
          "Loved this place so much to see and so much history. Its very unusual & you need to take your time going around",
          "We have missed this site on previous Barcelona trips and finally visited today. Wow! What a spectacular piece of engineering and art. The audioguide was wonderful and the room presentations were excellent. A must see in Barcelona.",
          "An easy self guided tour that is another Must!! Book ahead, which we were lucky we did as we saw so many get turned away as they do limit how many are allowed in the building per hour. It is a casual self guided and very informative tour to enjoy.",

          "If you are going to visit one of Gaudi\u2019s houses make sure it\u2019s this one. The exterior is arresting, the Gaudi interior is fabulous, make sure you get the audio tour and the museum of his work in the attic shouldn\u2019t be missed. The iconic undulating roof with signature chimneys is",
          "We really enjoyed our visit at La Pedrera. A truly unique piece of architecture unlike anything you will ever see.",

          "We were SO disappointed in our visit. I had done the tour three or Four years ago and really enjoyed it so I brought my husband there. Waste of time and money. The guide was impossible to understand. She was Asian and had heavily accented English . Not a problem at all, until",
          "Worth a look, especially the roof. All reviews said buy tickets in advance to avoid lines of 30 minutes or more.. I went in October and there was no line.",
          "Was able to visit via a group tour and it was wonderful. Be sure to visit the rooftop for an incredible view.",
          "An interesting experience when in Barcelona. The self-guided tour worked really well. However, find the entre to be a rather expensive. Opportunity to buy many exciting Gaud\u00ed and other souvenirs.",
          "You feel like you are in a city of its own once up on the roof! You want to soak in Gaudi's decorative art with the rooftop views of the city and the perspective you get of the Sagrada -- and in the museum you are offered many opportunities to understand Gaudi and how",
          "Whilst we didn\u2019t actually take a tour inside the building, it was cool even just to see Gaudi\u2019s sandstone architecture from outside.",
          "Although superficially less \u2018fanciful\u2019 and pretty than Casa Batll\u00f3, Mila is still a must-visit simply because this is the largest and last residential building Gaud\u00ed completed. Also because of its many unique innovations of a structurally self-supporting stone fa\u00e7ade, an open",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to La Pedrera. I was thrilled that it was so close to my hotel so I was able to see it multiple times, both day and evening. The audio guided tour was amazing. I took so many pics. Gaudi was so creative and ahead of his time both with aesthetics",
          "Look at the details! Gaudi left us another masterpiece in Barcelona. We were fortunate to have a very knowledgeable guide who helped us understand this amazing building.",
          "La Pedrera was well worth the visit and i would definately recommend it for anyone visiting Barcelona. only downside, skip the line was of no use what so ever! there was 2 lines one that was for people needing to buy their ticket and then one for people who had already bought",
          "Fantastic self guided tour. A must see site in Barcelona. So worth the skip the line fee. The views from the roof are spectacular. The audio guide was very informative.",
          "My self guide head set was faulty, it kept shutting down, there are no signs or options to change the device so I had to put up with an intermittent reception missing out on the tour. Sadly at the end of the tour I asked for a part refund from a manager who\u2019s name I know but",
          "We did a full tour of La Pedrera/Casa Mila, and were very impressed with it. The interior courtyard where our tour started had beautiful detailing on the ceiling. We were taken by elevator to the rooftop, which is incredibly unique, with its \"guardians\" everywhere and amazing",
          "We did not take a tour, but we lingered on the outside and took a lot of photos. This is one of the Modermista Greatest Hits and is incredibly beautiful.",
          "We were going to book tickets but didn\u2019t. Rocked up about 6.00 and a chap was giving out free fast pass and audio tour for the normal admission price. Amazing place, very clever man. An inspiration!",
          "Really enjoyed looking through this cool Gaudi building, it was my personal favourite out of this and Casa Batllo. We bought the premium tickets that allow you to skip the line to the roof and basically go straight up, so we didn't wait in line.",
          "Amazing building from that time... dificult to imagine how a brand thinking 100 years forward. Must be see... excellent point to be visit",

          "A quick look see at Casa Mil\u00e0 this morning, it\u2019s a stunning construction. Why aren\u2019t more buildings put together with this kind of imagination? Make more time and go and see the interior too. I missed out on that.",

          "There are three big pluses to this attraction. First of all, the architecture is fascinating. There are so many interesting details to this place, and those that take the time to look closely and absorb it all will be rewarded. Secondly, the audioguide is really well done. I",
          "The first stop on our \"Gaudi Day\" with a private guide. The outside of this home is bla compared with Casa Batllo, but it is the apartment here at Casa Mila that once can see the beauty of the design and how folks would have lived back in the day. Lots of steps, so be",

He was extremely knowledgeable about the history, architectural design theory, and construction techniques of the building. Being",
          "Another build by Gaudi. We did the tour bus and it took us by this place. You can visit one of the apartments and take pictures. There were people on the roof taking pictures too. It looks very unique.",
          "This is a nice quirky building. Gothic looking from the outside. Great for taking photos. Can get quite busy.",
          "The tour was packed even though it\u2019s expensive. Was impossible to hear the guide, not enough time to even read the signs. Audio Visual on the roof really not worth the money. Better come visit during the day !! Complete rip off.",
          "The Casa Mila is an interesting look at architecture, but also how the upper class lived in an earlier time in Barcelona.",
          "We did not plan to visit this attraction however as we were taking photos outside, one of the sales approached us and gave us a fast pass for the same price as the usual ticket(25 Euro). We also decided to take this because this sales manage to tell us the difference between",
          "Modern and beautiful. We could not believe our eyes! How an architect could be so progressive, so modern at that time? Worth it every cent!",
          "Amazing Gaudi work - absolutely stunning. Take the tour. Be sure to check out the rooftop. Cafe on main floor veer good. Would like to see this a second time.",
          "A classic that should be delightful to watch for Connoisseurs of art and architecture. A splendid harmony of turning stone into waves of symphony that represents the building. Tall and imposing every part of the building is quite impressive in terms of grandeur that is created",
          "Starting at 8.40 pm, we had a very good experience taking a guided tour of Casa Mila OR La Pederera. Walking through the building interiors with unique architecture, and knowing about the history of the building was fascinating. The light show on the roof top was mesmerizing. It",
          "So interesting on how this buildings are created, this is another must see. Plan ahead as the lines are long over the weekend.",
          "We just looked in from the outside as we thought for us 20 euro was a bit much to get in & that was the pensioner price. We loved the outside of the building & saw a little bit of what it was like on the inside. We think it would be worth it to go inside to look.",
          "Amazing place. Try and make time for this particular visit as its gorgeous and imaginative. Beware of pickpockets",
          "This was the best visit of the holiday - such an incredible place with excellent examples of the brilliance of Gaudi. Just loved the whole visit from start to finish. Highly recommend. Do check the normal line round the side before paying a premium straight in rate - the queue",
          "This was very interesting to visit. Not knowing anything about Gaudi, we didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised. The curves make it more engaging, it seems. Liked the rooftop best with the geometric forms but don't really know how to describe.",
          "We visited this building as part of a nice walk in the evening visiting a couple of Gaudi buildings in the general area. More beautiful architecture that is easily viewed at night.",
          "My wife and I visited La Pedrera (the Quarry), Gaudi\u2019s spectacular mansion, also called Casa Mila after the original owner. The Attic was amazing, with its arched and ridged, skeletal walls. The Apartment is very interesting, but is only open during the day. Again, be sure to",
          "This house is known as La Pedrera, in fact, non-English folks know this house by this name only. And yes this is also UNESCO World Heritage. Its Gaudi's after all. Located at Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia Street, the most happening street in Barcelona after La Rambla. First some fun",
          "Gaudi and Barcelona are synonymous. The Gaudi buildings in Barcelona are truly magical. The beautiful curves, use of coloured glass and tiles and timber is inspiring. Casa Mila, as it is also named was probably one of our favourite Gaudi buildings in Barcelona. The roof top is",
          "Got my tickets at the door for 25\u20ac per person with audio-guide. We were there around 10ish and got lucky as there's not much a long line but of course, you can also purchase your tickets prior online. You can take the elevator or walk the stairs up to the beautiful attic which",
          "Don't miss this work of art on the beautiful passeig de gracia blvd. You will see why Gaudi is considered to be a revolutionary architect!",
          "Every detail of this building has been touched but the imagination of A. Gaudi; from the bottom to the top. We had a local guide who explained it's place in time. It was so fascinating from the crazy roof to the construction to the apartment. A must-see of Barcelona.",
          "There are so many great things about this building. Obviouly the roof is amazing with the many beautiful chimneys. The rib-cage like arches that support the attic are equally stunning and other-worldly. The cicular courtyards are cool too. And the exterior is inspiring. I",
          "This building exterior was very cool and part of Gaud\u00ed structures in Barcelona. Not a must see experience if you are just viewing the exterior - wish we would\u2019ve had time to view the interior and roof with a tour as that seems to be where the best part of this is.",
          "Excellent opportunity to experience Gaudi up close. Self guided tours of the ground floor, roof, attic and an apartment provide an up close opportunity to see how this master blended function with organic form. Buy your tickets on line for the earliest time slot as this gets",
          "We passed this beautifully designed building by Gaudy while exploring Barcelona. The entrance fee to visit the interior and the rooftop surprised us as it begins from 25 Euro per person... As a public heritage it\u2019s infuriating and unjust!!",
          "Went in the afternoon, no lines to speak of, audio tour patchy, headset uncomfortable. A quick elevator ride to the roof and your transported to a different world. Spend as much time here as you can, really is the highlight of the visit, the chimney designs are uniquely Gaud\u00ed,",
          "This is one of Gaudi's work. The audio guide is very informational. The self guided tour starts on the roof and what an interesting roof it is. I particularly enjoyed the attic space with the brick arches and the models. It is so cool to see the skeleton framing of Gaudi's",
          "It was a part of our small-group minivan tour. We just looked at this Goudi building from outside and the gude told us a story of this house. Quite interesting...",
          "Lots to see in the house, stunning architecture, we were happy with the amount we got to visit inside and as it's \u20ac25 so you want to feel you're getting value for money. Loved the gift shop, had to resist buying all of the beautiful jewellery, scarves, ornaments for sale in",
          "The outside of La Pedrera is very interesting. We did a night tour and got to see the entry courtyard, which is open to the air above. Our guide was knowledgeable and spoke English. We saw a film that was projected onto the walls, which showed the nature that inspired",
          "This place is really beautiful. Loved the rooftop. Very unique. The audio guide was useful. Try to go early so there won\u2019t be many people around so you can savor the moments and take some pictures.",
          "If you have only limited time in Barcelona to immerse yourself in the grandeur of Gaudi's works, reserve a tour of La Pedrera (online, in advance). The audio guided tour takes you from floor to floor up stairways, through rooms while describing Gaudi and the building's history.",
          "The building is really one of its kind, especially wandering on the roof and looking at the elements like chimneys there is special.",
          "Make reservations online or end up waiting in line. You are taken to the roof to start your tour. We had headphones that were very descriptive. The roof is undelilating making walking a new experience. Descriptions inside Attic really explained how building is put together.",
          "Go early to enjoy this Gaudi masterpiece. The rooftop will take your breath away and it is the first place you visit on your self-guided tour. You can spend as much time as you like on the roof with views all the way to Sagrada Familia. This building really allows you to see",
          "La Pedrera is an amazing place to visit. The audioguided tour is interesting and highlights the most important aspects of the apartment building. I would highly recommend a visit. Try for a time earlier in the day when it is less busy.",
          "Its completely a unique building with steep cliff walls and wavy facades that boasts the skill of Spanish architects. It is said to have been built between 1906 and 1912 and also a UNESCO world heritage. At present it's open for visits and has become a prominent landmark in",
          "Paid up for the night experience and dinner. We loved our dining experience and the show was interesting. The building is truly inspiring and unique. My favorite was the small crowd and additional time in each area.",
          "Great tour starting at the top and winding down stairs through the many layers of the building. Lockers are available making it a far more enjoyable experience than il Battlo. The house is also fully restored and filled with period details. No virtual tour here as everything is",
          "If you enjoy art, Gaudi's art, then it's a place you must see. You will find here examples of Gaudi's nature inspirations. Worth's see it.",
          "Did not go inside this one but if you are heading to Batllo then it\u2019s worth a stop by to see another Gaudi work. Not as cool as Batllo but worth a photo.",
          "What a GREAT place to see, you should definitely go!!! Look at the place that had Star Wars Storm Troopers before they were famous!",
          "Spending time on the rooftop was a thrill. Seeing the models and other materials in the attic offered new insight into his design process and innovation. And then seeing the apartment gave us a view into what it would be like to live in a Gaudi designed space. We are so happy",
          "It was OK, but I was disappointed in that there was not much to see. The roof is the highlight, but too crowded. The attic was OK, but the rooms that you could visit were just OK. I guess my favorite was the ground floor...",
          "I was blown away when my eyes first beheld this Jewel - then I went inside. The architecture & finishing touches were beautiful. Then I used the audio guide to view the rooms back in the day when they were decked with furniture - fascinating!",
          "Wonderful building and really helps you see Gaudi's ability to create usch unique buildings whether they are for an apartment building or for a basilica.",
          "Again expensive like Casa Batlio and less colourful but amazing roof. I\u2019d pay for that alone. Cheaper booking online but we timed in when there fewer people queuing. We witnessed some very rude tourists who were trying to jump the queue at Casa Mila - more than one group and on",
          "This place is huge but you only have access to the ground floor, the attic, one apartment and the roof. The roof was really interesting and was a huge space but the attic was dark and included a lot of reading. The tour through the apartment was interesting but not as fun and",
          "The tour was nice and the guide explained quite well. I've enjoyed the light show as well. But I would've loved it to have the video at the beginning removed ( it was a few minutes ) and the light show at the end to be shorter. It's nice and all but 10-15 minutes duration was a",
          "My husband and I visited this incredible building today. Great views from the terrace and well worth the visit. Buy tickets ahead of time to avoid the lines.",
          "This building was another example of how an extraordinary architect/artist Gaudi was. Every detail was design with perfection.",
          "This is a very impressive building decided to do a tour which starts on the roof. It's a great experience even though I am personally a little afraid of heights the views of the city are amazing also. Could have spent a great deal of time in here the architecture was amazing.",
          "This is a one of a kind place. The concept and the way tjis house was built is simply mind blowing. Gaudi was a genius in understanding that nature in its simplicity already jas all the answers.",
          "Casa Mila's beauty can be clearly appreciated from the outside, but I wasn't awestruck on the inside like I have been with other buildings (including Gaudi's own Sagrada Familia). I would have appreciated it more if the audio guide had been a bit more straightforward. It waxes",
          "Great attraction must item in you schedule.we have visited in 06/Oct @ afternoon Relatively fast queue lines Nice to have the audio guide to understand more about gaudi",
          "Gaudi's La Pedrera is a beautiful building with a very interactive and interesting audio guided tour. There was a very short wait in line as they ensured only a certain number of people entered at once, to prevent it from becoming overcrowded. You start in an open atrium and the",
          "Gaudi was really a genious. The house is stunning, with a marvelous rooftop and chimneys from the fairy tail. Perfect for instagram photos, just a bit crowdy. Inside is also beautiful. A great insight into another era.",
          "This building is popularly know as \"la pedrera\" (the quarrry). Antoni Gaud\u00ed, his architect, built it at the beginning of the 20th century. You can visit the upper terrace and some floors. It is one of the most visited places in Barcelona.",
          "By far one of the tours we loved. Casa Mila is chock full of stories and outstanding architectural features. The home is so impressive and the key details worth every penny of the tour cost. Treat yourself to a wonderful experience and tour this home today !",
          "We did like this visit very much. Great architecture and good audio guide along with crowded but ok space.",
          "The magic city of Barcelona, with its marvelous attractions is a great experience for a tourist. La Pedrera of Gaud\u00ed is a very important place.",
          "You must visit La Pedrera when in Barcelona. Gaudi was an exceptional artist and this is a top house design.",
          "Technology was excellent, the tour prompt was initiated by an electronic prompt in the environment. I appreciated the \"Attic Museum\". The visuals were very informative. The apartment visit was very congested.",
          "I was amazing by this stone work. It was really something to see the balconies all shaped in a dramatic wave. Railing to match.",
          "An architectural marvel, an iconic work of the maverick architect Gaudi. The strange and unique facade, the roof-top attractions, and very functional living quarters- all are very impressive",
          "At firts bluhs, this might seem like just checking out a bullding but Le Pedrera is much, much more. The design is breathtaking and innovative and the tour is worthwhile. I consider this building slightly superior to Gaudi's Casa Botllo because it was bult form the ground up",
          "We really enjoyed our tour of La Pedrera. The rooftop and attic were awesome and informative. The apartment was also very interesting. We found the audio guide to be a little troublesome and felt we missed some audio information because we would keep hearing the same",
          "Amazing architucture. Gaudi was a genious. It is very easy to reach Casa Mila, just take the train to Passeig de Gracia and remember to purchase tickets for the visit in advance.",
          "Visited but this is more of a museum of Gaudi than about the building. The rooftop is cool but not worth the tickets. We visited after doing early access at Casa Bastillo... which was way better. Save your money and visit a different Gaudi site.",
          "Antoni Gaudi's unique creativity with both design and structure is a feast for the eyes. A fantasy world that is worth exploring throughout the city.",
          "So much fun to see the unusual architecture of this building and hear the stories of the tenants. A must see! Take a guide with you who knows the stories.",
          "La pedrera or Casa Mila is a very interesting house, the architecture is amazing. I loved the rooftop!",
          "When in Barcelona you have to see Gaudi architecture and this was one fine example. Lots of stairs to walk up but there is a lift if required.",
          "If you only have time to see one of Gaudi's houses then this is the number 1 choice to see. The lobby area takes your breath away and the roof top just leaves you stunned. The rooms are all unique and something to see",
          "It is a wonderful place specially the roof top which deserves a nice time there. Has a beautiful view of the city and the sculptures are amazing! Also the museum floor is amazing and it gives a real image of the life in the beginning of the 20th century. If you\u2019re into Gaud\u00ed\u2019s",
          "Being one of the most popular sites, you definitely need to make a reservation many days in advance to go inside. Note that if only viewed from outside, there are tall trees in front, so disappointing if you want a picture from a bus driving past. Hint: best to take picture",
          "Good tour with audio guide. Lots of things to see . All the big projects of Gaudi are presented on one floor. I recommend highly!!",
          "It is easy to see how the original owner was disappointed in Gaudi's work on this building...it is as uninspiring and gaunt as Casa Batilo was inspiring and colorful.",
          "Our tour went first to the rooftop, then to the attic museum. We went with a tour group and had a splendid time. Gaudi certainly sparks the imagination!",
          "We were told that the photo was free with the ticket, but only the second photo is free. The first one costs 10 euro!!!! They made it sound like even the first was free when making us pose. So beware. This is a very poor tactic for an institution like this. The roof top is",
          "I have travelled to several countries and seen much better architecture and significance not worth 25Euros at all, should be cheaper. If you are an artist and maybe you wanna explore the building it is fine. Otherwise not really a mandatory visit.",
          "After you marvel at the exterior...take a tour of the inside. Essentially being used as offices and \"grandfathered\" residential housing, this masterpiece Is an awesome look at a phenomenal forward thinking artist, architect and developer who was definitely ahead of his time. The",
          "All are different in their own way; this is still a private residence as well as a tourist destination. You will take an elevator to the roof and you won't believe what you will see; great views of the city also.",
          "La Pedrera is another fine example of Gaudi's obsessive attention to every detail. I particularly loved the chimney-Star Warriors atop the roof, but the plan and the guided tour make this a stand-out.",
          "Again, another piece of Gaudi's of architecture to the world. Looks different and majestic from the outside, but did not enter, only can marvel from the outside",
          "This was the first Gaudi building we visited while in Barcelona and I found it very interesting and beautiful. It really set the stage for the other buildings we would visit later.",
          "Gaudi had a lot of Influence on Barcelona and its citizens. He lived in Barcelona and loved it. You can see his architecture all around Barcelona.",
          "This place is a great example of the luxury apartments that were built by Gaudi early 19th century. The price is best if you book on-line. The self walking tour with headphones was informative and fairly detailed. The tour begins on the roof, then goes to the attic, then a",
          "The rooftop was fascinating and the highlight of our visit. The audio tour synced well with the various points of interest.",
          "Great self guided audio tour of the building - very informative. FYI, you will be taking a number of steps up to the attic .",
          "Excellent showcase for Gaudi's brilliance. So original and enchanting. The roof is amazing with its undulating floor, mosaics, sculptures. The loft is charming. We just turned up and did our own audio tour; the commentary changes as you move around the building. All great.",
          "We had already seen Casa Batllo and were expecting something similar, the only thing of similarity were the wonderful shaped window handles. We spent ages on the roof top and then were wowed by the attic, where it is so spacious you can feel you are in the belly of a whale.",
          "This house is fantastic. From the base floor to the rooftop everywhere has a detail do be observed. Gaudi's creativity goes to a next level in this place from the three guardians in the rooftop to the sealife details on the floor.",
          "Many others have reviewed this architectural wonder, so we'll add a note on customer service. Due to an oversight, we over-booked a day and arrived at 7:55 PM, which was before the last entry and before their 8:30 closing. We were disappointed when we were told they really start",
          "Disclaimer that this review is just for the exterior building and I can't comment on whether \u20ac20-35 is worth it to go in. This 'must see' work of architecture is certainly interesting but in person just seems like a huge organic concrete slab. It is in a busy tourist/shopping",
          "Really enjoyed this. Didn't but tickets ahead and mid afternoon, mid week, could walk straight in. Roof is amazing. The wall height on the roof is low so it is intimidating if you are scared of heights. Looks of space for shade and some amazing views of the city.",
          "This is an experience. $60 for a four course dinner, including wine. Afterwards, a guide took us through the top floor and onto the roof of this famous Gaudi landmark apartment house. Originally a home for one family, this structure is a unique architectural wonder.",
          "I will let the pictures tell the story, but here are some facts: Largest permanent apartment home in Europe when built 1906 to 1912, main floor appartment f ou r the owner was 14,000 square feet. First underground parking garage in Europe for any type of building. Six floors",
          "We went to see this place few weeks ago while we were visiting Barcelona. The place looks pretty interesting tho I found it a bit pricey at 22 euro, I much rather like Casa Batlo tho that too was overpriced in my book. I would say not a must see unless you are a fan of Gaudi's",
          "The best pictures of the building are from outside. The terrace is also unice. Interesting details from the audioguide.",
          "What a wonderful experience. Get the audio guide, it\u2019s well worth it. Pre-book online and skip the queue. Try and go in the morning before it gets to busy or it\u2019ll be too crowded in the apartment itself and you\u2019d hate to feel rushed. You\u2019ll want to go when it\u2019s not raining so",
          "A must-see in Barcelona. That was the first venue we visited in Barcelona. That was a perfect introduction to the city touched by the visionary Gaudi. The roof is spectacular. You won\u2019t regret it.",
          "We entered La Pedrera after being given a history of the building. The tour is self guided with personal players as many of the museums. It starts on the roof top with a view of the city and roof structures. The Attic contains models of the architecture of many of Gaudi's",
          "One of the favorite places visited in Barcelona. The house is just magical, beautiful design, architecture. The terrace is absolutely beautiful. I recommend to buy the tickets online to avoid the lines, and if you get there a little earlier their coffee shop has an amazing",
          "I booked online on the OFFICIAL site ( Don't use the other unofficial sites !!) and did not have to queue in the rain! The first let down was that the rooftop was closed ( no reason given!) Insude then ,you have the attic space ( basically just a museum with nothing much in it",
          "Absolutely amazing place and well worth a visit but didn\u2019t need skip the line ticket as there was no line even at mid morning!",
          "iconic buildings line the most famous avanue of Barcelona...just from the outside one can stand and admire the architecture and try to understand the mind behind these amazing buildings.",
          "This is well worth seeing and appears to be easier to book than Sagrada Familia. We got a good discount as over 65s. We pre-booked which avoided the entrance queue. It is a vast building and the route through the building is fairly well marked. You do get to see an apartment as",
          "A fascinating Gaudi building with a spectacular roof top. The Gaudi exhibition inside gives a wide range of 'influences' on Gaudi's style of architecture.",
          "Casa Mila is one of Gaudi's great creations and is utterly worth a visit to see the fantastic architecture, particularly on the roof, as well as other aspects of life that Gaudi's genius for design touched. We paid a premium price (32 Euro as opposed to 25) to skip the queue",
          "Me and my friend went here on a whim didnt have too much information about Casa Mila beforehand but so glad we went in. There was no queue (as it was December) so we got straight in. We got given headphones and then a voice guided tour of the building. Absolutely beautiful",
          "This amazing building was entirely built according to Gaud\u00ed's plans. Inspirations from nature are seen throughout. Buying the premium tickets online ahead of time is worth it with audioguide included to avoid the long lines for tickets, audioguides, and elevators and to be able",
          "I have been many times to Barcelona but never got around to visit La Pedrera. Very interesting, beautiful and well organized.",
          "I purchased a ticket in advance for Casa Mila - the one I purchased provided audio and also allowed entrance at any time. This was great, because I could skip the line and enter whenever I chose. The rooftop of Casa Mila is outright phenomenal. There were quite a few tourists",
          "Unique architecture Good ambiance in surrounding area with designer and luxury brands We didn\u2019t go inside",
          "La Pedrera is absolutely gorgeous. We are definitely not art lovers. But this place is outstanding. Definitely worth a visit during your stay in Barcelona. 1 tip though, pre order tickets online, this can save you some time in line.",
          "We booked the night light experience without knowing much about it so I will try to give all the details we wanted to know. Arrive on time and wait in front of the main doors at the coroner and the guards will check your tickets and let you in (on your phone is fine) and I would",
          "I highly recommend. We bought tickets on the spot and it was more expansive than buying online. We took the basic tour, we went up to the roof and the attic.",
          "Loved this apartment building designed by Gaudi. The rooftop was interesting with unusual chimney-like protrusions. The museum on the floor below was intriguing as it portrayed how the building was constructed. Enjoyed a glimpse into a 19th century apartment.",
          "We went in early september and getting in was no problem. the audio guided tour helped a lot to truly appreciate this beautiful piece of art. the furniture on display was simple but timeless. the cleverly lit interior through use of the sun was amazing as it criss crossed",
          "La Pedrera is another piece of art that you CANNOT miss if you ever visit Barcelona. It is Gaudi\u2019s artistic mind in action, and what a mind!!",
          "Interesting but not worth the money. The light show went on too long and not that good. Tour guide was very good and tried her best.",
          "I must say it appears as if this building is flowing. The tour brought us to the museum at the very top of the building, which highlights Gaudi's techniques in building this house. Truly can't believe it was built at the beginning of the 20th century and not the 21st. The",
          "The rooftop is still my favorite part, however, I discovered new wonders during a tour of the interior. Must see attraction in Barcelona!",
          "Stopped here to learn more about Gaudi on a Runner Bean tour - such an amazing combination of art and design - no wonder it went over budget!",
          "I consider this building Gaudi's second best design after Sagrada Familia. You will take elevator up to the top floor and walk downstairs. I like their audio guide. Until other audio guide that we have to push a number, this audio guide knows where you are in the build and tells",
          "The tour was informative and the guide gave lots of insight and detail that helped us interpret things when visiting other Gaudi buildings during our stay. Being able to go inside this lovely building was so special in itself but the roof top light show was spectacular and",
          "We really enjoyed the light show on the roof. And out tour guide was really knowledgeable. Small bit of advice, have a seat on the steps when they start the light show!!",
          "This building is truly beautiful. Like the Sagrada Familia you see how nature truly inspired Gaudi and it's visible in his work. I purchased my ticket before hand and did the audio guide which was very informative. There are several Gaudi buildings in Barcelona but If I had to",
          "Obviously an awesome Gaud\u00ed building in Barcelona. I am writing this review to inform the public (and maybe even persuade the management of the building) about the roof/rain situation. If it's raining, even just slightly drizzling, you will not be allowed to go up to the roof.",
          "One of the best representations of Gaud\u00ed architecture. An excellent audio tour. It lasted about an hour and a half. But you go at your own pace. The audio is set up to talk about what ever your standing in front of. The audio was very clear and easy to understand. Highly",
          "we did this on a dull day to pass the time and we were not disappointed, esp. the roof is a must see.",
          "By all means go on to the roof and be sure to go through the arch that frames Sagada Familia in the distance. One of the best photo opportunities in Barcelona. This apartment style building is full of surprises.",
          "The blending of nature and building is so interesting! A video in the attic shows how Gaudi turned to the stomach of a whale and butterflies for inspiration. Worthwhile!",
          "After seeing Casa Batll\u00f3 I was keen to see more of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s work, and this did not disappoint. While plainer from the outside the inside is very impressive and lovely to look at. There are display rooms with furniture to show how the rooms were used. The rooftop has beautiful",
          "Well worth a visit. The staff are friendly and helpful, and you're given as much time as you want to look round the roof, the attic and the apartment. Would recommend the audio guide, and would also recommend pre-booking as it can be very busy.",
          "Impossible to go to Barcelona and skip La Pedrera. It is out of this world. The gaud\u00ed genius at full display.",
          "We\u2019re here 12 years ago and enjoyed it immensely. They have now added a free audio tour and expanded visits of the roof, attic and apartment. Don\u2019t let the 25 euro price keep you away. The views from the roof ant the sculptures are amazing. Also a GREAT view of Gaudis La Sagrada",
          "La Pedrera is a wonder for sure. Purchase tickets ahead of time online. This home embodies nature and Gaudi\u2019s creative talent is seen everywhere you look. The roof is just amazing! Though there are multiple steps up and down, the experience of wandering around viewing the unique",
          "Good to see, good to walk around and marvel at the architecture and imagine how it was all created. Amazing",
          "This is a unique piece of architecture and well worth the visit with a good audio guide.You will never see anything like this again unless you visit another house designed by Gaudi, and unlike the Casa Battlo, this has Gaudi designed furnishings in it which adds a different",
          "Located close to Casa Batll\u00f3 on Passeig de Gracia. Very nice apartment building. Amazing exterior, so many curves and interesting shapes. A must see!",
          "We visited both Mila and Batllo on the same day, which was really interesting. I believe Mila was built right after Batllo, and it's fascinating to see the differences in the coloring used and the basic assumptions Gaudi had when starting each project. As with Batllo, getting",
          "Our tour guide was wonderful (sorry I can\u2019t remember his name!). He was smart and friendly and informed. The group was smaller than 15 people and it was a real luxury to be there before the crowds and their cameras and selfies descended on the building. The group was composed of",
          "We thoroughly loved the Pedrera. The architecture,the painting on the ceilings and walls, and the wonderful moldings around the doors, the molded ceilings. A little weirded out by the \"Guardians\", but they are beautiful. Was fascinated with the supports in the attic. What a",
          "This tour definitely helped me to understand the thinking behind why Gaudi did what he did and how he produced the architecture that he did. The views from the roof were amazing and seeing the artic and the apartment. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Barcelona",

          "Only 3 of the 8 floors in the building are open. 1. The roof which closes on rainy days. 2. The attic which is a continuous loop of archways like a tunnel. 3. The apartment which consists of small rooms with virtually none of Gaudi's architectural quirks in them. We have",

          "What a unique and beautiful building by Antoni Gaudi it truly is an incredible architectural masterpiece. You must visit here and wonder at this amazing building. Not only does it's exterior look amazing but the interior looks just as good. I particularly enjoyed the rooftop",
          "We had planned on visiting Park G\u00fcell but were unable to get in that afternoon. We decided to visit Casa Mika. It was such a beautiful example of Gaudi. The tour was very informative.",
          "This amazing house will not disappoint you ! Such a work of art - and to be built so long ago ! Truly wonderful Great audio too",
          "An architectural marvel - one of a kind. Gaudi succeeded in constructing a building that rivals any of today's great buildings all without the benefit of computer aided design",

          "Such a beautiful work of art that is a building that seems a living thing. All the undulating, delicate surfaces made me feel as though I was embraced. Didn't want to leave the first floor. Then I reached the attic and didn't want to leave it. Everyone talks about the chimneys",

          "We missed Gaudi \u201cstuff\u201d on our last visit to Barcelona and came back this time to make up for that. Visiting the area was so rewarding. We had a personal guide who was extremely knowledgeable about the history of Barcelona and Gaudi so our learning was greatly enhanced by this.",

          "Another unbelievable Gaudi architectural extravaganza! The first recommendation is the you pre purchase \"skip the line audio tickets\" online. Entry is then quick and easy. This building is absolutely amazing and even now, 100 years later, ahead of it's time. The engineering and",

          "I really enjoyed the tour. I'd suggest getting the fast track so that you avoid the queues. I would suggest doing this tour before you go and see the Sagrada Familia as it gives you more of a backstory and makes you understand the brilliance of Gaudi and his work. I loved the",

          "My second favorite creation of Gaudi after Sagrada, this building looks straight out of a Sci-Fi movie. Go early on a sunny day to get the best photographs. The roof is easily the highlight of this building with the magnificent soldier like chimneys and the amazing wave like",
          "It\u2019s really a must in Barcelona! It shows the genius of Gaudi and the way he mixed the nature with architecture. The visit is very well organized but it\u2019s a pity that only a small part of the house is showed. I do recommend the night multimedia spectacle!",

          "Architecture is incredible, can't get over the genius of Gaudi. Especially once you get to the roof, there's a cool view of the Sagrada Familia from Casa Mila. Of the Gaudi places, if you're going to pay for one this is the one to pay for",
          "It is a unique building and worth a visit however at 22 euros is expensive to walk around the roof space and see an apartment furnished in it's original style",
          "It is even better from the inside than from the outside. The rooftop is amazing and has a good view over the city. In the exhibition it is also explained a lot about Gaudis work in general. Interesting!",
          "Beautiful itself yet very fragile work of wrist. Amazed by uniqueness and only to find in Barcelona . even flowers everywhere",
          "One of many Gaud\u00ed masterpieces. Reading the history prior to visit will be helpful. To bad to visit all this tourist attraction is 22 to 25 euros. But if you have the time and the money by all means go for it. In summer time expect long lines.",

          "We went to Casa Mil\u00e0 without booking and there was no problems with queues - entrance was a bit steep at 25 Euros each but does include an annoying audio guide. To get to the rooftop you have to go up a surprising number of stairs but the lift is also available. Once there the",
          "Very disappointed. I thought I would see more of the home. Was in the entrance for awhile-up the stairs to where the servants were (nothing to see) up the stairs again to the laundry area close to roof-then up to roof for a light show that was lame. The sight from the roof top",

          "Of the two Gaudi houses near each other in Barcelona, tour this one. We found it more interesting and a better overview of Gaudi's overall work and life. I'm not an architectural tourist but found this very interesting and informative. A guy way ahead of his time in form and",
          "An absolute must to do when in Barcelona. Great audio tour and videos. Skip the line tix are worth it as this is a crowded time in Barcelona. The house is amazing and the tour gives great insight into Gaudi\u2019s thinking. As his professors once said, \u201cwe are not sure if we are",
          "If you would like to see one of Gaudi's buildings, this is it. Not that many people were here, the rooftop is magnificent, the museum part is also fine. We spent a little more than an hour here.",
          "We did both the day and night tour and both were really good. You get to see more during the day but it is just so special at night so I am glad we did both. You are usually only here once so I think it is worth the money to do both. I love all things Gaudi and could go to",
          "I would said it\u2019s the most worth place to visit in Barcelona. The tour is perfect, very convenient and informative and interesting.",
          "This was my second visit to Casa Mila. The first time I visited during the regular day tour but this review is about the night tour. I recommend this tour because it's a smaller group and you learn different things than you do during the day. You will also have plenty of",
          "The roof and exterior of this amazing apartment block are the crowning glory of his work. Dont miss the distant view of the Sagrada Familia through the arch on the roof. The warriors will amaze you. The loft is very surprising too. Do not miss this experience !",
          "The outside of this building is intriguing but the inside is only mildly interesting. The cost of entry is more than the visit is worth.",
          "This originally was a block of flats designed by Antoni Gaudi and reflected his connection to nature as they were designed to look like caves. People at the time ridiculed the design but now it is an iconic tourist attraction.",
          "This is interesting place. One of the \"must see\" things in Barcelona. The roof is having the most interesting design, so better see it to judge yourself. Otherwise it is like \"one apartment\" museum to see how people live back in time when this was built.",
          "Another Gaudi idea on this architecture! Interior has a nice flow and airy. Lots of lights in the rooms within the apartment. There were separate stairs for the servants.",

          "Casa Mila is a stunning piece of Architecture by Antoni Gaud\u00ed , it has stunning views from the roof of Casa Mila , the handles on the doors and windows are a work of architectural marvel , when standing in the atrium , if you look up you can see the guardians on top of the roof",
          "I visited La Perdera for the second tine. It worth the visit . The facade and roof top are impressive . La Perdera helps to discover the style of Gaudi .",
          "For me this was the best representation of Gaudi and his works. Absolutely stunning. Book online and respect the time and there'll be no waiting. Explore the interior, the rooftop is unbelievable.",
          "Of all the museums we visited in Barcelona, this was my favorite. I felt like Alice in Wonderland going from room to room, up stairs, down stairs. The archetecture miracle of no support beams is awe inspiring .",
          "Only went for the basic ticket for this one so dont know if missed out but enjoyed the views as well as the structure of attics. Explanations on audio about the functions as well as the decor. Read also that the house is owned by a charity foundation so entrance fees support",
          "Everyone knows how great of place it is, but the audio tour was great. It was the best one out of the museums we went to in Barcelona. It was turning on as you walk in in the new area, it had great information. It was definitely worth the money. a must in Barcelona",
          "Although the building was amazing, as I believe all Gaudi's stuff to be, it took 40 minutes to see it all not 90 as told to us. There was an insane number of people there which made it quite difficult to get around if you are of a certain age and mobility. But, as I say, well",
          "well worth the visit if your into Gaudi come to think of it doesn't matter if your not.. this place is something else he was before his time with design style the hop on hop off bus drops you off across the road so easy to find pre book tickets as it gets very busy and they view",
          "Barcelona has so much beauty to offer and you simply find it on the street, sometimes even in the street (special pavement). This is another piece of great architecture. Sharing pictures of a few examples",
          "My husband and I purchased tickets three weeks ahead of time and got a morning entrance time. We did not have a line to wait in, and it was easy to see everything we wanted. The audio comes with the entrance price and is blue toothed as you enter different levels and/or rooms.",
          "This experience was very underwhelming. The lobby is beautiful as is the rooftop with the light show and some Disney-style music, but everything in between was completely boring. The guide spent way too much time in the attic taking about the history of the building",
          "Nice place to stop for have a look outside and inside. We did not enter inside but from outside is really nice spot for a photo. Highly recommended.",
          "We enjoyed the tour and specially going up to the roof top. This building was a highlight of our time in Barcelona.",

          "La Pedrera is one of Gaudi's most known houses to visit, three blocks away from Batlo house, on Pasage de Gracie avenue. It's a pretty good hour and a half of walking within its rooms and dependencies, from its door to the rooftop through a kind of museum where you might see",
          "Great little audio tour that was full of information about the house and Gaudi and what was going on in the world at the time. Rooftop views are impressive. It does get busy so book ahead. Stairs or lift to the top which is on the eighth floor. We walked but it's a long way to",

          "This is a beautiful building and worth seeing. However, be prepared because there are a lot of stairs to the top. It was very crowded and very hot when we visited in August. The roof was fascinating but after the climb it was hard to be out long in the hot sun. The skip the",
          "In a contrary to Casa Batll\u00f3, the inside of the building is more interesting than the more plain looking building of the outside. The different apartments and how they\u2019re shaped in the inside are really interesting.",

          "The UNESCO-listed Casa Mil\u00e0 or \u2018La Pedrera, a masterpiece building designed by Antoni Gaudi is one of one of Barcelona's must-see attractions.

          "Visited Barcelona just to see all possible Gaudi's architecture masterpieces.Casa Mila was one of them.I love Gaudi's attention to detail, how he thinks and incorporates elements of nature in all of his creations.Flowers , earthy colors and play of shadows and light. I was more",
          "I visited two of Gaudi's famous houses on the same day . That was my plan and it worked because two of them were very close. It was great that I previously bought Skip the Line tour ticket. It was timed entrance and I didnt have to wait in line in rain. Also I could see house",
          "I visited La Pedrera early in the morning (9am). I hadn\u2019t booked a ticket and got in straight away. The audio-guide was extremely informative and included in the 25 euros ticket. The roof top was amazing as it is so unusual. There are a lot of photos opportunities once you are",
          "The building is really nice. It is on a really nice street full of expensive designer shops. It costs around \u20ac25 to go up the building. We didn\u2019t have time to do it but hopefully we will next time. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Casa Mila-la Pedrera is an amazing structure by the famous Modernisitc architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. The apartment building is considered a wave of nature set in concrete. Gauidi was inspired by and fascinated with forms from nature, so evident n this lovely building. We did not",
          "Pre-booking the audio tour online was well worth while. No line, and the audio tour was wonderful, synchronizing perfectly with each space as we moved through the building. The tour takes you to the stunning roof (with a great view of Sagrada Familia!), the amazing attic space",

          "We decided to visit either Casa Battlo or La Pedrera and choose this one to visit - we just viewed the Casa Battlo from outside. You are told this building is the most authentic of Gaudi. It is a very interesting self guided tour, you start on the amazing roof terrace and come",

          "Viewed from outside only, didn't feel it was worth the price of admission. Having seen it we can understand why the original owners chose not to live here.",
          "This isn\u2019t a far walk from Casa Batllo or Casa Amatller. This is also bang in the middle of the city. You get an audio guide and you enter the courtyard first. Here you can either queue to get a lift up to the rooftop and work your way down or like me if you felt guilty",
          "La Pedrera is just very interesting for fans of Gaudi\u2019s work. The roof and is quite remarkable if you have a head for heights, and the attic space is a work of genius. Of all the Gaudi work in Barcelona, Casa Mil\u00e0 gives you a very clear sense of his intention to mimic nature in",
          "I highly recommend Casa Mila. It's still reasonably accessible (Sagrada Familia is jammed with tourists) and utterly lovely. A few people still live in the building - if you see somebody with groceries jumping the entry line, they are probably just going home. There is so much",
          "The best way to enjoy this amazing architecture is to see it at night. No crowds just your small group and a docent. We were lucky that the summer rains had stopped and our tour was not cancelled. The docent was very friendly and knowledgeable. He spoke of Gaudi's life, how",
          "I admit I am not a huge fan of Gaudi. Casa Mila, however, is worth the time and money even if you hate Sagrada Familia! This apartment building seems to have grown up from the natural world smack in the middle of the big city, from the lobby tree-columns and flowered murals to",
          "Like all the Gaudi architecture that can be visited around Barcelona, this is beautiful and clever in equal measure. The audio tour is a good length and works well - it's all location activated so that it triggers as you enter each part of the building. As a result you are",
          "This attraction is not expensive and takes about a couple of hours. It was easy to book and the staff were very helpful. The building itself is amazing...The rooms and displays were excellent. There are lifts if you do not fancy the stairs!"

        "wiki": "The Park G\u00fcell (Catalan: Parc G\u00fcell [\u02c8pa\u027e\u0261 \u02c8\u0261we\u028e]; Spanish: Parque G\u00fcell) is a public park system composed of gardens and architectural elements located on Carmel Hill, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of Collserola \u2013 the Parc del Carmel is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in La Salut, a neighborhood in the Gr\u00e0cia district of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, Eusebi G\u00fcell assigned the design of the park to Antoni Gaud\u00ed, a renowned architect and the face of Catalan modernism.\nThe park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site under \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\".\n\n\n== Description ==\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his naturalist phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family (Catalan: Sagrada Familia).\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by symbolism, since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political Catalanism \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the Catalan countries are represented \u2013 and from Catholicism \u2013 the Monumento al Calvario, originally designed to be a chapel. The mythological elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the Temple of Apollo of Delphi.On the other hand, many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex iconography that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to religious exaltation, passing through mythology, history and philosophy. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to Freemasonry, despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and Count G\u00fcell. These references have not been proven in the historiography of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and puzzles.\n\n\n== Origins as a housing development ==\n\nThe park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count Eusebi G\u00fcell, after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English garden city movement; hence the original English name Park (in Catalan the name is \"Parc G\u00fcell\"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called Muntanya Pelada (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called La Salut (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the Gaudi House Museum (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.\n\n\n== Municipal garden ==\n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Church.\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion. One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the Barcelona City History Museum MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of Catalan nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator Josep Maria Jujol.Roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching vaulting under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell so that the inverted catenary arch shapes form perfect compression structures.At the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is \"El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus,\" however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (another one of Antoni Guad\u00ed's famous creations), the Agbar Tower, and the Montju\u00efc area visible at a distance.\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of parrot found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including short-toed eagle. The park also supports a population of hummingbird hawk moths.\n\n\n== Gallery of images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Modernisme buildings in Barcelona\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPark Guell website",

Living in Sant Cugat, I had decided to take a stroll around one of my favourite places for an hour or so. I didn\u2019t want to do the \u201ctourist\u201d section but I certainly wasn\u2019t",
          "Amazing Gaudi park. Due to the situation it was quite empty. so we could really enjoy it. Visit it, it is unique!",
          "We really enjoyed this. In the guide book they tell you to take a bus but for me the Metro is easier as long as you don't mind a long walk. Great park both inside and outside the gates. Very enjoyable. I would probably go back to this place.",
          "It's a must visit while being in Barcelona. There are nine different entrances to the Park depending on how you arrive at the place. I took the bus from Alfonso X and left me right at one of the main entry gates. Very beautiful views and sights from different angles within the",
          "What a wonderful, beautiful, spiritual and relaxing place, exactly what we need in these hard times. It always feels like you are welcome here no matter what.",
          "The park itself is awesome but it doesn't change the fact that it's hard to see anything in the crowd. People are everywhere, taking pictures, touching whatever they can, stepping on your feet... Everything is fabulous but there is no way to enjoy it... It's sad. I can't imagine",
          "Make sure you take a taxi to get to this part of Barcelona - steep hill, hence the great view. Also make sure you purchase tickets as there are lines and waits for those who don't. We really enjoyed this creation of Gaudi and leaning about how and why it was created for Eusebi",
          "The park had some areas under renovation, the day was gray, but even so, Gaud\u00ed's works could color any cloudy day. I believe that when the works are finished, it will be much more pleasant to visit the park, a pity that we did not enjoy 100% of what it has to offer!",
          "I had always thought that Parc Guell was bigger than it actually is. It was great fun exploring and seeing all the sights, but even though it was the off season, it was crowded. The architecture and tile work is spectacular but as crowded as it was when we were there I can't",
          "Experi\u00eancia sempre singular de passear nos jardins deste maravilhoso parque e suas belas obras arquitet\u00f4nicas !! Always unique experience of walking in the gardens of this wonderful park and its beautiful architectural works !!",
          "Saw the free section of the park which is great along with the house but book a ticket in advance as the main area requires a ticket and we were too late",
          "I'll be honest, I didn't love it. I knew that I wouldn't love the style and that's ok. My wife really enjoyed seeing the mosaics and unusual architecture. It was worth a visit and there is certainly nothing else like it.",
          "A must see park in Barcelona. The colours of the mosaics in the park are a visual feast. So beautifully designed and such a pleasure visit. Amazing architecture..a tribute to Gaudi's brilliance. The view towards Sagrada Familia cathedral from the park is panoramic.",
          "The Park is in and of itself a work of Art. Its a must see in Barcelona . Buy your tickets on line before you arrive .They are at a Premium and you may not get in if you wait .Tickets have a timed entrance so leave enough time to get there from your hotel .",
          "Do not miss. But, our visit was crowded and lots of renovations. But, still worth the crowds. I will be back!",
          "Beautiful park and gardens with stunning views, and some amazing architecture. Highly recommend visiting.",
          "The park is massive with lots of pathways which meander through the park. You just need to have the whole day and plenty of stamina to see it properly. The trees and shrubs provide a much need natural park in any city. Throughout the park there are sculptures by Gaud\u00ed that",
          "Amazing park which travels you in another dimension!! I easily could spend a whole day in there. Gaudi once again made his miracle.",
          "Beautiful architecture and a good place to spend a day. If you go on the top of the hill will have a great panoramic view of the city. Great!",
          "The creativity expressed at this park i unlike any we have seen. Look down and look up! You will be amazed at how broken tiles were transformed into a work of art. Be careful not to get lost. We found it difficult to find the entry to the park and as we were leaving, we",
          "It's so nice place. One of the best monuments to visit. I really like It and it's really Nice. Gaud\u00ed is one of the best artists of the world \u2665\ufe0f.",
          "This time we didn't visit the restricted area of the park, a minor part, but, off course the most interesting. There are many beautiful parks in great cities like London, NY, Paris or Madri, but the Parc Guell is a little show room of the fantastic world of Gaudi.",
          "A surrealist landscaped park with architectural elements of viaducts, grottoes, colonnaded hall, winding staircases, semi-closed conversation seats decorated in multicoloured ceramic fragments. A terrace with views of the city and the sea. Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed with a garden,",
          "Overall we enjoyed our visit. The work that Gaudi did is mind blowing and amazing. The park, however, was confusing and once you leave you absolutely cannot get back in without new tickets. There are 2 sections to this park, one you pay for and one that is free. It's not",
          "I love this park. If you can get here early and beat the queues it\u2019s a beautiful place to sit or to wander around. Some amazing architecture and it truly captures everything Gaudi. If you have more than a day in Barca then this place is a must after some of the other things.",
          "This is why I travel . . . to experience this type of history and art/architecture in person. It\u2019s definitely worth a stop.",
          "A lovely place with a marwellous viev over Barcelona. Nice houses, history and colours all over the place. Gardens and historic messages all over. Take a walk up here if you have good condition :) Dont forget to bring a termos of coffee and some sandwiches ( Swedish fika) :-)",
          "This is a little hike to get up, it\u2019s worth the time. On the way you see all his creations, once you are up can see the city very well",
          "Visited on my mums surprise birthday trip as somewhere she had always wanted to go (I had visited previously) was still such an amazing visit and worth paying the entrance fee into as this is the best part of the park in my opinion.",
          "Architecture is just sublime. Lovely place to spend a few hours. All sort of interesting things to look at.",
          "Visited the park as a part of a hop on and hop off his visit - but of a walk from the drop off point but glad we did. Lovely park with amazing sights and sounds - wild parrots too. Some of the areas were closed due to work being Carried out but we still had a great time",
          "We visited here on a Barcelona panoramic tour, and I had no idea this place even existed. What a tremendous find. It's worth taking a guided tour here to learn the fascinating history and to learn about meanings behind the beautiful elements of the park. Plus admission is",
          "Enter before 8:30am to avoid charge. Interesting space given history. Impressive structure, Very visionary. We were there before it opened, realizing we didn\u2019t need our tickets (purchased online).",
          "Great park that you can enter for free. Lovely for a family to explore. Take a picnic. Quite a steep approach (one way is steps and the worse, other is slope ) and then have an elevated view of city, but really well kept and worth the visit. There are additional attractions to",
          "We purchased tickets online, rode the HopOnHopOff bus to the Parc G\u00fcell stop, used google maps to find the way up to the park entrance ( about a 10 minute walk) then started wandering around the beautiful park. It\u2019s free to enter but you must have tickets to visit the Monument",
          "A very nice park to visit , especially if you have children so they can enjoy themselves running, chasing pigeons, feeding little green parrots and just having fun .",
          "We spent an entire morning walking through the park. Make sure you buy tickets in advance to get on the terrace with the pretty benches!",
          "Amazing place to visit and enjoy Gaudi\u2019s work! Definitely buy tickets in advance or go before oficial opening, for free with less people in your shots \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Sadly accessibility is limited due to the number of steps but an amazing place. This man truly had a vision.",
          "Park Guell is a public park designed by Antoni Guadi (the same architect who designed La Sagrada Familia). While most of the park is free to visit, there is a pay-to-visit section (\u20ac10 fee) to aid its restoration. Being located in a steep hill, the park offers fantastic views of",
          "A must see experience when in Barcelona. The park grounds are lovely but you have to pay to enter various parts which was slightly disappointing because parts of these areas were under renovation. Gaud\u00ed s imagination was unbelievable and the workmanship is second to none. Great",
          "It's worth getting to Parc Guell early as it gets busy. It takes about 45 minutes to walk there from the Sagrada famillia or use the hope on off buses. It was easy to pay when you get there. Although you can view some of the park for free it is worth paying the \u20ac10 to get into",
          "The architecture is cool, I mean it's Gaudi. Not much exciting compared to other sites, and the only source of information is from the map you are given at the start. Then you walk around a perimeter of the place.",
          "We missed this last time we were visiting Barcelona so it is a nice place to visit. Quirky! Busy place with other tourists. We took a little bus which runs regularly up and down the steep incline.",
          "I came here a few years ago and it was free. It was a lovely walk to have and there were beautiful parks to wander. Now you have to pay \u20ac10 just to walk around. It's a rip off. I will admit it is beautiful, but think \u20ac10 is too much, a donation of \u20ac2-3 should be enough to wall",
          "Ok I was not impressed think we came up the wrong way very steep lots of steps . Nearly killed me off it was exhausting. Good views",
          "Visited whilst in Barcelona with my daughter for a long weekend, caught hop on hop off bus to nearest stop. Didn't find it was signposted very well from bus stop or even in the parc itself. Fantastic buildings and views but not my favourite in the city",
          "It is a fantastic place. Wander around at your own pace. Soak it all up. I\u2019d advise buying your ticket online to avoid the queues. A great view over the city too.",
          "100% recommend. Don\u2019t let anyone fool you, we easily spent 3 hours here. They even have a food court where you can grab lunch, a beer, coffee, Icecream. Absolutely wonderful Park. Lots of hiking if you explore the free areas So come prepared!",
          "After seeing pictures online and other reviews we expected alot more from this. Main park area was free to visit which we didn't know and only paid the fee to enter the sort of main circle to take a photo of the famous view which was soo busy and covered in scaffolding in that",
          "My review is for the park only. Plenty of plants variety and beautiful surrounding. You have to wear confortable shoe's since you have to walk a lot. If you reach the Mirador terrace you can see all the Barcelona surrounding. Nice place for kids and families.",
          "You could probably spend a whole day there! Plenty of walking paths and breathtaking views over the city! Plus Gaud\u00ed\u2019s work! Will be back when visiting Barcelona again!",
          "Dont pay. It is just a crap encirclement, you cant see anything until you end up paying for each separate entrance up to 50 EUR. Only to find the real charm is above the fenced enclosure in the greenery above. Really adds to Barcelonas tourist trap, tourist thieving image. Why",
          "Our visit was fairly short as it was part of a P&O here excursion but the sun was shining and the park looked lovely even though it was February so the flowers and trees were still not in bloom.Our visit was mainly to see the Gaudi architecture and features which although not",
          "It is a little hard to find and get to if you're walking, it is a beautiful park, interesting, shady, lots of walking there, too. Bring water.",
          "We had a beautiful day in the park. Music, people and the views. Loved every moment. We took lots of pictures, and leisurely took our time to walk through the park. I think there were too many vendors selling stuff, but other than that, it was a really great day and we were",
          "Beautiful park with so many twists and twists that have absolutely amazing view points. A great place to relax or a place to have a nice long hike.",
          "We visited the park in a tour and were amazed by all of the little details and fine craftsmanship. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We were a bit put off by the lines and reading that you need to buy tickets in advance. But then discovered that the majority of the park is free entrance - people are only paying to go inside the Gaudi buildings. We had a lovely afternoon walking the trails and enjoying the",
          "The parc is beautiful but It is very hard to understand where to buy tickets and the staff has been very rude every time we asked a question about the place and the touristic path to follow.",
          "We pre booked skip the line tickets, when we arrived we was told entrance to the park is free, our tickets were so we could get close up to Gaudi\u2019s work, you have to queue up for this at a designated time and you get 30 minutes to look around, not our sort of thing really so we",
          "Paid area is very limited and not worth the money you have to pay and the queue you have to stand waiting",
          "Beautiful mosaic and enjoyable walk. Must go into the restricted area where you pay. It is worth it.",
          "To see Gaudi dream of a residential place, come here. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t translate into his vision. The park surrounding PArc Guell is nice and spacious. Pace guell itself is ok average. For 10 euros, don\u2019t see much just open rooftop square to look at his 2 buildings. The",
          "If you are visiting Barcelona for some days , you have to visit this park . There you can see all the Barcelona from the highest point .... it\u2019s unbelievable emotion and expressions for all your life :))",
          "The majority of this park is free, but you must pay to get in to see the architecture built by Gaudi. The buildings and facades are out totally unique, but I was expecting a bit more for my money. If you buy your ticket in advance you can get the free bus (provided by the park)",
          "Highly recommend a walk through this park and admire the views over Barcelona, it really fills your hart with joy",
          "Walk in the nature, get the top of the mountain and then go down to Parc Guell to see the most colourful building walls you have ever seen, as well as an outstanding view of the place!!!",
          "That\u2019s a beautiful place but 90% of the parc is free and we paid 10\u20ac for the 10 other percent which was too expensive for the prestation",
          "We went on the hop on bus tour and decided to stop and see this. Quite a walk uphill to the park, and then found no tickets available to get in to the main part. Ok to walk round the gardens and see the mosaics on the outer walls. Get tickets in advance.",
          "I walked up to Parc Guell to show friends the amazing sights and views. It is still a must when visiting Barcelona and you can still get free access to most of the parc. Alas the terrace and staircase etc are now restricted and you need a timed ticket to access. Parc Guell is a",
          "It is certainly an interesting place but it felt very busy, even in February and we gave up on the queue to get in the gatekeepers house. Some of the staff were quite rude and it isn\u2019t the easiest place to find your way around, especially outside.",
          "We had a Gaudi day during our city break and visited the Parc mid afternoon on a glorious sunny day, fantastic views and architecture. Thoroughly recommend",
          "Park Guell is one of the key attractions in Barcelona and part of famous Architect Gaudi's work. You can spend 2-3 hours there. Ensure that you know how to get there. We had a long walk from the nearest MRT station. Beware of pick pockets. One key thing to note is that the",
          "We went on a lovely sunny day in Feb so it was very pleasant to walk around. We stopped a local walking her dog and asked if she thought it was worth paying to visit the parts that were not free access. She said if you visit before 8am everything is free so that is worth",
          "Is a nice place to visit when you visit Barcelona. I really had a good time there. Easy to get there with tram and metro bus",
          "Very nice and beautiful park that has everything that a great park should: various landscapes, beautiful routs, trees and flowers, Gaudi buildings!!! Must see",
          "Visited and paid \u20ac10 for entry into the restricted part. Bit pointless as there is nothing more in there that you can see or do from the outside. All buildings are visible from the outside. The only difference is that the restricted part has a cafe. If you visit, take a pic then",
          "Very interesting place and unfortunately since we were on a tour, we only had an hour but I could see spending a couple hours here. The views of the city from the upper terrace were beautiful. Plenty of construction going on so that did detract a little from the beauty. Also it",
          "Make sure you book in advance of visiting otherwise you will not be able to access the main areas. There is a public park which is free of charge but to visit the attractions you have to book and pay. Admission is on a timed basis so book early. Directions on how to get there",
          "Don\u2019t buy tickets for restricted area. Every Gaudi creation is perfectly visible from the free area of the park. Selfie on the famous bench is not worth it.",
          "Absolutely stunning. I overheard one teen say \u201cI\u2019d seen it in pictures but it is so much better in real life.\u201d It really is! Walk up to the top of the park fur fabulous views across the city it the sea.",
          "Most part been renovated. Same amount of visitors allowed so packed. Not enjoyable. However the free section was nice to visit. Wait until renovations are over",
          "We went without doing research and we were tired. Lots of steps and walking - should have saved it until we knew what to look for and were more rested. Beautiful park but we didn\u2019t get inside home etc which we would recommend. So much thought put into all the designing.For",
          "We went here after visiting the other Gaudi buildings, so did not really appreciate the park after being dazzled earlier. If you intend to spend a day visiting Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia, suggest visiting the park in the morning and then walking downhill through the local",
          "It gives a nice view of the city and was interesting but I don\u2019t see what all the fuss is about. The consteucruon also detracts from the experience.",
          "Park Guell was a really nice way to spend a morning in Barcelona. It was an interesting introduction to Gaudi's work as well as a really beautiful park to explore. Right on top of a hill, it also provides excellent views over Barcelona.",
          "We went here on one of the \u201cbeat the line\u201d tours and the site left us asking, \u201cIs that all there is?\u201d On our week in Barcelona we did and saw a lot and this was near the bottom.",
          "Had been recommended a visit to the park around Parc Guell. Got the metro to Lesseps. The sign posts are not very clear so we took a long walk to get there! Basically head out of the station and follow initial signs to parc guell. When you get to the shop 'Subway' take left up",
          "This parque is a great viewpoint in Barcelona to enjoy a morning. We went with a guided tour so we could understand more of its history.",
          "It\u2019s a fab, other worldly place but it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s not a genuinely fancy public park anymore. The throngs of people queuing to get into the various bits that are paid entry does spoil it a bit. The Gaudi museum in his old house was interesting and excellent value and didn\u2019t",
          "A must see area to view Antonio Gaudi designs. 1-2 hours tops. The gingerbread houses are interesting",
          "We enjoyed our guided tour as the guide shared lots of information about Gaud\u00ed and Park G\u00fcell. Using the shuttle from Alfons X was great and convenient since the service comes with the ticket. We tried walking there, too and the shuttle is much nicer. Go early if you can. There",
          "Underwhelming attraction but you might think that you missed something by not going. Quite small and takes less than 30 minutes to see all if the queue to the small house is short. Take a taxi or bus to the park as it is very steep to walk.",
          "This experience was not as impressive as the houses that Gaudi did, and since it is rather removed from the other venues, I did not feel that it was all that impressive compared to his other work. I took a taxi to the park, it is out of the way and not to well identified with",
          "Difficult to see the exhibits through the myriads of excited photographers. I can not imagine what it must be like at other times of year..! Nice park just outside the attraction, free of charge.",
          "We took the advice of a local and didn\u2019t bother paying for the ticket but instead wandered around the free open part of the park and it was fabulous. You could still see the Gaudi works and there was tonnes to explore. Can\u2019t comment on the inside part but it was certainly worth",
          "such an inspiring place, gaudi's work is truly remarkable, not similar to anything i have seen before .",
          "Great park. Not the easiest to get to: best to take taxi if in central Barcelona. There\u2019s a restricted area which you have to pay to get in, which odd worth the admission (suggest book online to avoid ticket queue). A couple of Gaud\u00ed houses at start (\u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d) which",
          "I just wandered the free areas of the park. The gaudi house and museum was included in my ticket to Sagrada familia. The party itself is very can and relaxing. The hike up to the park is pretty steep. There are escalators part of the way, but I didn't see them until I was on my",
          "Absolutely loved visiting Parc G\u00fcell - we visited on a sunny day and had views right down to the coast and beyond! We visited about 10am and it was already very busy (if you want those empty Instagram shots, I\u2019d suggest the earliest ticket!) and definitely buy your tickets in",
          "Worth hopping off the bus to visit especially for people who love design and colour. Go early as by 4.00p.m. we were rushing to see everything as it was getting cold and dark",
          "You can buy your timed tickets online from the ParcGuell website. It currently costs 10E and includes a return trip on a shuttle bus from the local Metro station. So no worries about going on a magical mystery tour!",
          "Rookie mistake, went there in February assuming low season would be quiet enough to just walk in the paid area of the park. Wrong. Ended up only doing the free part as the next available time slot for the paid part was 3 hrs later. Our mistake \ud83d\ude2d. Beautiful park tho! \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Another beautiful creation by Antoni Gaudi, the park is beautiful and we\u2019ll worth the trip out of the city to go see.",
          "If you take the bus to Gaudi's Park Guell, make sure that you know which stop is the correct stop before boarding the bus. We were told by a lady on the bus to get off at a certain bus stop since she said we missed the previous stop; neither were correct. It turns out that the",
          "Even if you don'twant to pag to visit some areas, it's highly suggested to visit the park. You're in the nature, there are beautiful views over the city and very amusing examples of creative architecture. Gaud\u00ec deserves your appreciation here as well",
          "The architecture of Gaud\u00ed is amazing. Great tour with Eva from nhue.com via heading.com. The ergonomics of the furnishings and ecological sensitivity are amazing.",
          "Another one of Gaudi's masterpieces. Beautiful area to walk around and enjoy. Especially enjoyed Gaudi's house.",
          "We traveled here with my daughter in a stroller. Buy tickets ahead of time to avoid the lines. There are many open spaces where kids can safely run around to get them tired and sleepy. Keep in mind that there arent really any elevators here. We used a lightweight umbrella",
          "But it is the best way to go to the park, the bus picks you at the metro station I do recommend it I guess they want more details, but once you are in the park is a self guided tour",
          "A bit bad some parts are under construction, but dont miss it when in Barcelona. :) When i was there there were not unbearably many tourists, so it was comfortable and enjoyable to walk in the park. Dont miss the parts too which are free. :) Let the photos talk.",
          "This is a do not miss place. You really get to know the designer and see his work. All so colorful and how he incorporated nature with his designs. Really a beautiful place to see.",
          "A stunning park in Barcelona. Not really suitable if you are not very fit or physically disabled but well worth a visit. It is an amazing place with lots of quirky places to see. Loved it!",
          "The restricted part of the park, with the exception of the iconic drac ( lizard ) sculpture is not really all that exciting. The best part of the park is the one that is free of charge. The path to the top of the hill is not all that difficult and along the way you have a lot of",
          "Difficult to reach up to the hills but worth it To visit for photo shooting and walking and good views. You need at least 3 hours there",
          "Visited this on a Friday morning. We bought the ticket that included the bus ride to and from the park from alphonse x station. Was glad we did this as it is all uphill. The park was interesting in places but definitely not somewhere we would come again. The mosaics were",
          "Spend an hour and see gaudi magic Such super vision Do not miss shop as better things to buy than you might think",
          "An excellent place to start the day, with views down over the city then the opportunity to walk down through the town to the Gothic Quarter. The park has some fascinating structures. The main problems are: renovations/building (probably at its worst in early February), too",
          "To start off the ticket situation was confusing, make sure you buy tickets online in advance otherwise you will get the private park section and the person at the gate will try to direct you to the ticket office which even they didn\u2019t seem to know where it was. The park overall",
          "Great park for strolling. Has interesting architecture and sightseeing points that overlook the city. Is green, well-maintained, and clean. There\u2019s a section that is pay-to-enter but we stuck to the free areas, which was already huge. There are hills you can climb to get an even",
          "Evidence of Gaud\u00ed architecture can be seen in different parts of Barcelona but it\u2019s well worth a visit here. Combines inspiring architecture with a lovely park which are just perfect together. Most of the park is free but you can pay 10 euros for access to everything. You",
          "The day we went it was very sunny and you get an amazing view of the city. The paths were easy to follow and there was maps around so you knew where you were. You can actually spend hours here because it\u2019s just a nice place to be. We didn\u2019t pay to go to the main bit so can\u2019t",
          "Lovely peaceful park overlooking Barcelona. The architectural aspects are beautiful as are the views over the city.",

          "I really enjoyed Park Guell, but I would recommend trying to avoid weekends. The particularly interesting areas of the park were crammed with people attempting to take photos of themselves.",
          "The park is a nice visit but would not recommend that you pay for the restricted area, its crowded and half of the area is full of scaffolding. You can walk around most of the park free of charge and it is very nice, no need to pay for the building site! I would say that if you",
          "We bought the tickets online and used the bus from Metro st Alfons X going there and walked back (downhill and with a stroller, easy). When buying the ticket you should set a time for the \u201crestricted place\u201d. It was not really useful and the restricted place is similar to where",
          "Parc Guell was designed by Gaudi and his style is in everything you see. Too often we see a building or other structure and do not know of the backstory or the thought that goes into it. We did the guided tour and in January, had a small group with a park that was not",
          "The park is so beautiful! The view over the city is amazing. Even if you see only the free part the park is worth spending few hours in. And if you decide to pay for the rest you will not regret it. It\u2019s amazing! There are no lines in January but we still bought tickets online",
          "Park is a worth a visit but not really the Monumental Zone which you need to buy a ticket for as you can see it from various view points outside the Zone. If you do enter the Zone, buy online as it saves you loads of time and includes a bus ride from the metro station Alonso to",
          "I think it\u2019s important for people to know what they are getting into before committing to Parc Guell, because if you go just because you think it must be great since it\u2019s so popular and (inexplicably) so highly rated here, as we did, well, you don\u2019t know the whole story. We",
          "We visited in January, but it was still very crowded, which I think it could be normal for this kind of place. Anyway, you should buy your tickets online so that you can have you ride from AlfonsX also included, via bus, which drops you off at the entrance. There were a lot of",
          "I visited Parc Guell about 10 years ago and was completely awestruck by it! From the moment I walked up the famous gecko staircase I was blown away! This time I was quite disappointed! The entrance has been changed and you now have to walk miles to the seating plateau. Despite",
          "We recently had a wonderful weekend away and visited this magnificent park. Well worth a visit if you visit Barcelona with great views from the top of the park \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8",
          "Do not use GoogleMaps to get there! We did and it took us to like a back entrance that is a dog park and smells awful. Then, there were like no signs to get us to the ticket office. It literally was such a struggle to find it. However, once we did it was a great visit!",
          "The view is awesome and it really compensates for the time on bus to get there. Street artists play on special secret places and it created a magical vibe on the later summer afternoon.",
          "Such a beautiful park to walk around, amazing views of Barcelona from the top of the hill. It is worth paying the fee to go in to the monument area to get close to the gorgeous tile work, but it is not worth standing in line to go in the gatekeepers' house, there just isn't much",
          "Visited today and it was an interesting visit and for us...free. Tip 1 - if you are anywhere near the city centre, catch Bus No.24 - it leaves Placa de Catalunya ( bus stop is on the north side rather than by the Aerobus stops ie it\u2019s near the larger fountains and Iberhotel).",
          "It's a steep walk although the escalators help, from Metro Lesseps but certainly worth it. The views over Barcelona are panoramic while Gaudi's efforts in transforming this park are fascinating and fun. Wander higher up through winding paths and more of his creations. Do line",
          "Had read that some portions of the Parc are available to wander without a ticket. However, access to the built structures near entry gate and also the \u201ccommon spaces\u201d of this development are encompassed in the paid area. Tickets have an entry time. The Gaudi House (museum) is",
          "Fascinting. Fabulous half day out. A must see. Antonio Gaudi's architecture and buildings are amazing. a must see. We had a wonderful afternoon at Parc Guell. Took millions of photos. Really enjoyable",
          "If you arrive before 8am you can access to restricted area (that you have to pay for) for free! Such beautiful architecture and design, something I will remember the most from Barcelona! Also great for a quick jog/run and a bit of exercise! There were plenty of locals going for",
          "We visited later in the afternoon and stayed until dusk. It was busy, but entry is limited to prevent over crowding. There is much to see. Walking is part of the experience. Relax and take your time to enjoy it.",
          "Must see, must see, must see, Must see, must see, must see, Must see, must see, must see and enjoy it, breathe it, live it. Try to go early in the morning otherwise the queue will be too long.",
          "This is one of my favorite maps. Great textures and color palate. Overall very well made. It plays well too. Just the right amount of vertical play. The objectives put me in the mood like I'm actually diffusing a live situation. I recommend this map.",
          "A very nice place to visit! Nice view of Barcelona! A lot of things to see! Book in advance because it's a very popular place!",
          "Very good few hours spent here, location off the main road could have been signposted a little better, but thats me being picky. Of course the downside is that lots of other tourists are there and it becomes overcrowded even with staggered entrance times",
          "Barcelona is a unique city. And it feels like miro had a lot to do with it. This park, with the columns, the benches, the views. It's not a park, is art. You have to set up appointment but belive me, is absolutelly worth it",
          "We made the error of deciding to walk up to the park. we are reasonably fit but it nearly killed us. I suggest getting the free bus from the venter of town. (I wish we had known) it also means you won't have to Q when you get to the park. Food was a bit expensive but it is run",
          "My husband and I did the skip the line pass which was helpful. We took the hop on hop off bus to get here. The problem was that the bus stop was many blocks away from the actual park entrance. We really enjoyed the unique colorful structures here. Gaudi was a genius in his",
          "The details here are simply impossible to describe. The tiny little stone mosaic inlays are mindboggling, colorful, detailed and captivating. It really is something worth seeing if you are in Barcelona!",

          "I absolutely love Gaudi\u2019s architecture esthetic. It\u2019s unlike any other style I\u2019ve seen. His genius is reflected in this magnificent park built, honoring nature. There was a lot of construction everywhere and yet it was crowded, even in January, even in the paid section. It\u2019s a",

          "It certainly is a very interesting park and I've never seen a park like it before. However, I think it's quite pricey for what it is, but at the same time I do see why they charge so much. We paid \u20ac10 each for the entrance fee + bus combination which we bougjt in advance. The",

          "Free to walk around most of the parc originally it was to be a private housing development but this dream was never realised there are some interesting architectural things to see and fab views across Barcelona.When we were there there were people playing Spanish music and",
          "Some ruins among good walking trails, though somewhat cheapened by the souvenir hawkers. Great fauna and birds, even in January, it must be exquisite in season!",
          "I'm putting that as my title as I didn't know this. When we visited 12 years ago, I don't think there were queues and I don't remember paying for it. Hence my surprise when I finally found the beautiful look out spot and there were timed queues and tickets. We took our photos up",
          "Be careful if you are using google maps to find the park from the metro - we did and although it got us there, it turns out that we climbed steep hills and many, many stairs for no reason - there is a route that has escalators all the way up to the top! Much of the park is free",
          "If you love architecture and Gaudi you have to see this place of course. It is not expensive at all (for those who love arts)",
          "A beautiful park and a great place to enjoy nature and architect. The famous dragon stands on the Central staircase for the Greek theatre and is a beautiful sight to see. Choose to go at the early hours of the morning because the park is illuminated only by natural light. If you",
          "It is really amazing to walk through Parc Guell. You can see the mountains and ocean from up there. We saw the sunset and all the little lights light up in the city when it got dark. Very nice walk with teenagers. The whole family enjoyed it!",
          "We visited Park G\u00fcell Recently, the actual park itself is quite big but the paid access area is quite small and crowded. It certainly isn\u2019t worth paying \u20ac12 For it. The best part of the fee is that there is a free bus from Alfons X metro station. Rather pay to visit G\u00fcell\u2019s",
          "You have to visit this park if you are in Barcelona. This place is very beautiful untouchable and the papagenos are very funny",
          "Easy to find along a very efficient tube train ride. The Park was spacious, attractively laid out and had stunning Gaudi ironwork, ceramics in all colours and ingenious arched nooks and crannies. We couldn't find the place to pay, despite being directed by park staff, wrongly",
          "We took a guided tour of the Parc. Apart from the colorful park this place has great views of the city including Sagrada Familia.",
          "This was my fourth visit to Park Guell as I\u2019d always had a great time, but had never paid to go into the ticketed area so decided to give it a try. Waste of time! You can see and take pictures of the two buildings through the outside gates and trust me: there\u2019s not much else to",
          "This is a hilltop park originally planned to be a luxary housing community in the late 19th century. However only two houses were booked - one which was bought the father of Antoni Goudi - the architect of the housing community. Later on this was converted to a park with steps",

          "The park comes in 3 parts, each of which should be considered separately... 1) The central area. This is a paid admission and includes the structures and sculptures the park is most famous for. You sort of have to pay or you'll miss the point, but the paid portion is only a",
          "Go at sunrise for a beautiful view sun rising over the city. Park can be covered in 1 hour, at minimum.",
          "It's worth visiting but is it worth the E10 entrance fee, me I'm not so sure. Everything is typical over the top Gaudi so you do get a visual feast and the grounds are ok. Despite it being 5th of Jan the queue for the guard house was huge and was way over the 45 minute mark so",
          "We took the metro to Parc Guell but the free side. It was totally worth the visit. Some people might think its far but it is so easy to get to and only a 10 minute walk from the metro (uphill mind you) we went for around 4:30 and watched the sunset. It was amazing! Certainly",
          "Bit disappointed ...Great views of Barcelona but there didn\u2019t seem that much to see here... I got a 8 euro taxi from top of Passeig so I was a bit disappointed by the lack of things to see here...there was a line for something which would have taken 45 minutes so I didn\u2019t",
          "I have been to thepark before when it was free, but I wanted to show it to my daughter. We went there without booking tickets beforehand which was no problem at all, except for the fact that the woman who helped at the ticket machine was very rude. The first free space was at",
          "A very unusual attempt at early 1900's city planning that failed at the time and is now a major attraction. Gaudi was an exceptional architect whose buildings are well worth visiting. Spend at least an hour here. It is built on a hill and can be slippery when wet.",
          "Gaudi architecture is very unique, colorful and close to nature styles. With a majestic entrance lots of greenery and different architecture, this is an interesting place. Pillars depicting the palm trees, washerwoman and typhoons add to the beauty. However, if you think that it",
          "Nice place to visit, only issue is that line to see Gaudi's place are huge and at this time, there is some remodeling, so we could not see everything. But very nice, I was there about 10 years ago, still wonderful Recommend to get tickets ahead.",
          "Nice relaxing stroll in the parc after a hectic New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. Lots of musicians in the parc which make it lovely. It\u2019s a shame the famous Gaudi chair is now a paid for entry only when we first visited a few years ago it was free. The rest of the parc is free.",
          "While Park Guell has an interesting history and some amazing Gaudi work - we felt this place was overhyped and fell slightly short of our elevated expectations, especially the Gaudi house. Consider visiting the free area of the park early in the morning for some good photos. The",
          "A wonderful Gaudi park to visit and explore. Pay the entry fee so that you can go into the building area . We did that in line before we left Australia so easy entry . There is a cafe too if you want food or drink. Walk the free area first then enter the paid section. Wonderful",
          "Yes! It\u2019s a park! You have to walk and there are steps. Don\u2019t listen to other people complaining about this. The views to Barcelona from this park are spectacular. Also, Gaud\u00ed\u2019s design can be appreciated everywhere. Really nice place.",
          "Made a walking tour to Park Guell, to get closer to the people & culture of Spanish people. Located high on the hill side of the city, walk was an effort. Entry ticket not required. One can pleasantly spend around 2 hrs admiring the creation of the park. Nothing curious on the",
          "Nice park but way too many people at some of the view points. Super experience to see all the weird architecture that is Barcelona. Need to be in good shape or have lots of time to make it to the highest point of the park. Easy access from most parts of the city.",
          "Such a pretty place to visit especially when the weather is nice. There is a fee to get in to the inside center part of the place but it is worth it. Lovely views, different buildings and sites to admire and to see. Learn a bit of the history of the area. It's all very",
          "This park is a unique blend of catalan and modern architecture. There is a major area which is free to visit and another portion of the park which is with an entrance ticket. Pity is that the queue for the tickets is huge and are sold out fast. Advance booking is a good option.",
          "Wonderful morning\u2019s walk and sight-seeing. A great introduction to the whimsy and genius of Gaud\u00ed. We were unable to get tickets but still had a great visit looking at the park outside.",
          "Charming place to wander through leafy paths although a bit of a climb. I also enjoyed the live guitar music from local buskers. Lots of tourists but still a nice spot to get away from the urban center and of course to immerse yourself in Gaudis surreal vision.",
          "I was here many years ago and apparently I never completed my draft review so I'm finishing it off now! I loved visiting this park. the best part were the whimsical elements designed by Antonio Gaudi. lovely place to spend a few hours.",
          "We were very excited to visit this masterpiece of Gaudi and booked an English guided tour in advance. Our guide was very uninteresting and didn\u2019t keep the interest of the group. We learned some new information but didn\u2019t enjoy the park as much as we had expected to.",
          "We were rather disappointed by Park Guell, which you have to book in advance (timed entry to the Gaudi area) and is some way from the city centre. Even with timed entry, fairly early in the morning, the place was packed so you could hardly move around the paths and steps, you",
          "We visited here 14 years ago and it has become a lot more commercialised. We used the shuttle bus which went from the Metro station Alfons X, in order to do this you need to have pre-booked your tickets and show the, to the driver. Parc G\u00fcell is very pretty with lovely views",
          "I've wanted to visit Parc Guell since seeing photos of it from my daughter's semester abroad over a decade ago, so it was a defintie bucket list item on this trip. From the Passeig de Gracia Metro statin we took Line 4 to the Anton X stop, and connected to Bus Guell, which",

          "My daughter and I enjoyed a beautiful afternoon in Parc Guell. The design is amazing, the place is beautiful, finding it tucked away in a corner of the busy city was worth all the effort. We found it on our own, and got lost more than once looking for it, but it is a great place",
          "Beautiful park in Barcelona. Definitely a must visit place. Highly recommended to buy the tickets online to visit the paid area of the park. There you can see the skyline of the city and take beautiful pictures. As the park is located on a hill, it is recommended to go by taxi",
          "An amazing place to visit. The architect design is fascinating. Walking around, one can appreciate how nature has been inspiration for designing.",
          "This is another must-go attraction in Barcelona. However, there is an ongoing construction. Please be there early so that you can truly enjoy every corner of the park. From the metro, it takes about 10 minutes to get to the park. The restrooms are clean and the gift shop and the",

          "Nice park to wall around and take pictures. I recommend buying tickets from KLOOK and coming to the park early. That way you are there to enjoy the nice views with hardly any people... then by the time the tour buses arrive you are just about done going around. So it was a",
          "YES! We were fortunate to visit on a beautiful December day in low season. My assumption is the park in high season is crazy packed with tourists. Note that we took a taxi that drops you off below the park. The walk up to it has a bit of an incline. Just follow the signs to",
          "We didn't go into the ticketed part of Park Guell as we didn't appreciate that you need to book in advance, however we strolled through the free part of the park and this was very enjoyable. You can get into the Gaudi museum in the park for \u20ac4 or \u20ac5 and look around the house",
          "I highly suggest taking a taxi to the park. We arrived by metro and it was a serious hike to the park. My fitbit registered 32 flights of stairs! I didn't think the signage was very good inside the park. We had a challenge finding the restrooms. But, the park is stunning",

          "We walked from the Gothic area up the park which took us about an hour. It has a slight uphill elevation most of the way and then becomes very steep for the final part. There are elevators at the end which was great. We did this walk in December and found it easy but would be",
          "We visited the park in the morning on a cloudy day. The paid portion on the park is very small and extremely crowded. Two main houses can be seen and photographed from outside of the fence. Other than houses, there are 2 mosaic staircase walls and the dragon. The dragon was",
          "This place is all I hoped it would be. The magic mix of Guell and Gaudi's partnership comes to life here. make sure to go early so it's not too busy. I took my time, and had to wait a few minutes here and there for the perfect photo shot with no other people in it, but that",
          "We found this an over rated trip. It cost 10 euro each to enter the Parc which gives you access to walk around the main building area where you get to see the two houses ( you can see these from the road) and the famous mosaic lizard along with a carved hillside walkway. This",
          "I visited this place with my wife and childrens. I was not so amazed myself, but my wife liked all the sculptures, plants in the park. Children were also happy to see so many bright colors, however, they are 3 and 5 years old so they got bored and tired very soon.",
          "It is nice but not wow. Nice buildings and a very beautiful panaromic view over Barcelona. A lot of walking up to the park.",
          "Just hit the free areas with the boys. Early morning so it wasn\u2019t crowded but after a couple of hours it was starting to get crazy. Can get plenty of hill climbs in over the course of the mornings. Lots of runners in the morning, if we were closer would love to run it.",
          "A fun, interesting park, largely designed by Gaudi. We enjoyed it, and many of the structures are just beautiful. However, we went during the holidays, and the crowds were overwhelming. The park environs are peaceful, but with the crowds, serenity was often lacking.",
          "Be sure to check out Parc Guell if you visit Barcelona! Going at sunrise is ideal (plus entrance is free before 8am)! A great place for pictures, views of Barcelona, a calm walk, or even just to admire Gaudi\u2019s work.",
          "A beautiful place to walk around, we were lucky in December and had 20 degree heat so saw it at its best. It\u2019s quite a distance from the centre of Barcelona, word of warning it is a big climb to get to the Parc once you are off the metro. As we got off the metro a kind",

          "Nice park to walk in and kill some time, the area that you have to pay to see could be missed in my opinion. Goes without saying but you should be prepared for lots of walking. The toilets are found in both the free and paid for areas. There is a cafe in the paid for area as",
          "A beautiful park indeed, but I do have to say it was smaller than I imagined. Certainly enough room for a hearty walk and/ or picnic. Try to book tix in advance to avoid queue if possible.",
          "It was extremely warm that day, I was in a tshirt, carrying around my heavier jacket, so weather is all over the place. Two things I think need to be shared that people don't often say. One: Park Guell is very large and free and open to the public, there are many entrances so",
          "Visited on the sunny, warm day before Xmas. It was just me and 399 selfie obsessed tourists crammed into the park. It is impossible to enjoy the architecture, soak in the design, or otherwise have a moment of reflection. I\u2019m a photographer and I could not shoot anything without",

          "Gaudier a s more Gaudi. Wouldn\u2019t call it a must see - plus many a pickpocket in and about. If really into Gaudi than a must see.",
          "Had a wonderful few hours here. The houses and structures are stunning, well worth a visit if you have the time",
          "Not sure if it is special arrangement for this time of the year, but we were told to arrive before 8:30am so we could visit the park, including the Gaudi session, for free! The added bonus was the golden sunlight at sunrise, making the park looks even lovelier.",
          "Winter brings a long slow sunrise, go before the Parc 'officially' opens, before 8? The light is sumptuous and the view of the city sublime. Locals walking dogs off leash, a few runners (GREAT running place), no vendors - yet, just a special way to start your day.",
          "So glad we skipped paying to get in. The whole front was covered in scaffolding. You can skip paying and see it from the walk way that goes around the whole thing. The free part of the park is just as gorgeous.",

          "If you are artsy at all, you should visit park Guell. Not only is it interesting to a regular person, but it is inspirational to any professional artist because of its colorful display of tile work and organic lines throught the construction of the park. Beside the highly",
          "I went in around 7am in the morning. The benefits of going so early in the morning were that I did not have to pay for the entrance fee, I could see the beautiful sunrise & also, avoid the crowds. It\u2019ll help you \u201cfeel\u201d the park a lot better if you read or watch documentaries",

          "TIMED ENTRY AVAILABLE AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Note: Most of the park is free to see, but the Gaudi architectural area is what you pay to see. Architect Gaudi designed this park for his primary patron, named Guell. It is located high on a hill overlooking Barcelona. You can",
          "If you like weird architectures and nature, like me, this is a place you can't miss. It also has interesting and beautiful photo spots. I do have to admit that the ticket allows you to go to a very little area of the park, and the rest of it is very big and completely free (and",
          "Another Gaudi's masterpiece. It's really pleasant to walk around the park, architecture, nature and amazing scenery from the top. Really enjoyed it :)",
          "this is a place you must visit while in Barcelona, the Parc Guell is full of history and architecture, it has a great city view and it has nearby coffee shops and souvenir stores if looking for something to buy. In my case I visited with small children and it was nice for them,",
          "I loved walking around -- it felt like if fell out of a fairy tale. We did all the Gaudi things available to us in Barcelona and I wouldn't have skipped any of it. My brother and I walked around for a couple hours. The weather was perfect and we had a great time.",
          "I have heard so much about this place but I have to say I was disappointed. Maybe it was because of the construction... don\u2019t get me wrong it was a nice place to visit but with all of the Gaud\u00ed influences in Barcelona this would not make it to the top of my list.",
          "If you go to Barcelona you must go to this parc cause it's best way to introduce Gaudi's work, and Barcelona is Gaudi's city. We went there on december so it wasn't so crowded but I would recommend online reservation which includes entry to the monumental area of the parc with",
          "Realy unique park, with the wonderful architecture of Gaudi. Wonderful creations of this genius and a relaxing walk too. The only bad thing is that they put an entrance ticket , not only to the house, as it was a few years ago, but also to the park. There is a part that you can",
          "Not too busy. Took the metro and had to walk uphill which was exhausting but worth it. Managed to find a bus which took us straight down to the centre afterwards.",
          "Make sure you buy tickets in advance on line 12 euros includes a bus ride from AlfonsoX station. Tickets there without the bus 10 euros. Beautiful views of Barcelona from above and great 2 hour walk.",
          "It was fantastic to see how Guell perfectly mixed nature and buildings in this Parc. It is far from the rest of the attractions, and, felt small for such a long trip from gothic quarter, but I am glad we did it. Wouldn't go back though.",
          "We did this as part of a tour in Barcelona for the 1 day we were there. Beautiful area with work by Gaudi. I would recommend doing this.",
          "Park Guell offers a ticket included bus transportation from Alfons X metro to the entrance. Both ways! Good choice to do it. The paid area is a mazing to see! Very nice and colorful buildings. I recommand also to take a walk in the free walking area of the park. Beste the",
          "Small cozy park with fascinating Gaudi masterpieces, lots of greens, funny parrots flying everywhere and amazing view on the city. If you use some of city passes or cards (we used Barcelona City Pass) it may be included in the list. If you want to walk more youbcan continue you",
          "My son and I visited and it was an awesome place to see and hear about. Would definitely go back and explore again.",
          "Great view and peaceful walk, not too crowded. Ticket queue was long, so best to get it online (you can buy it online when you reach there too). E-tickets accepted for entry, no need to print it out.",
          "We booked the tickets online to visit the house and the park was an added bonus. The house is small but very interesting. The grounds were lovely, with lots of parrots. We got a taxi to the park which was inexpensive and dropped us 2 minutes from the house. Great day.",
          "Well worth the visit, even in the rain! Bit of a trek to get there, even from the tour bus, but no trip to Barcelona would be complete without it. The view alone makes it worth while!",
          "This place is great. You can also visit here Gaudi's house, where he lived for 20 years. I booked the ticket online, but in December wasn't crowded at all.",
          "Title says it all really! The ticketed area apparently has more to see but the public area had an oppressive feel not helped by the notices posted everywhere warning of the high number of violent robberies. I love Barcelona but this left me cold.",
          "Thanks to a hotel staff we bought our ticket online on the day of our visit. The ticket also included the bus from Alfons X metro . We were glad we booked online as there was quite a long queue . So, we were allowed to wander in the park before reaching the entrance . The staff",

          "We visited the park at the beginning of November on Friday. We bought the tickets online for 11:00 AM one day before and they were already almost sold out. Apparently it was the busiest time as the touristic crowd was just too overwhelming. It was simply impossible to take",
          "I'm quite shocked at the barrage of negative reviews over pricing, queues and construction/maintaince. As a world heritage site, there are expectations for the upkeep and protection of the site. There would also be a massive(!) Tourist problem if admission was free. The queues",

          "UNBELIEVABLE !!! the beauty, the details, the colors, the shapes of the buildings. WOW !!! it was worth the hike to get there. The View of the city below was spectacular. Each building was unique and the vision that Gaudi had was so creative. We spend many hours there and",
          "Mush bigger than I imagined, The way Gaudi has included nature in the construction is really pleasing to the eye, a day in the park is not enough tike to explore all the intricacies of the Park. I started my day with a coffee and sandwich on the little Cafe and set up the plan",

          "Well maintained beauty in middle of the city. Low-key, attractive, and convenient to get to, via several methods",
          "We went to Parc Guell in order to view Gaudi's special architecture but were dissappointed as there was nothing special besides the houses and the lizard/dragon. We went to porch and the view was o.k but still we were wondering how comes the parc is one of Barcelona's top",
          "This is a beautiful park with great views. The first time that I went there I didn't have to pay to get in, so it was kind of chocking that I had to pay this time especially because the section that is included on the ticket is pretty small. Anyways it is just so a beautiful",
          "Designed by Gaudi, with the famous gecko fountain in the middle - this was a magical experience. A pre-Disney concept of color and texture with a view of the city and sea beyond. I have one criticism - it is not fully accessible, with ranks and stairs designed before any",

          "Its a bit overrated really...80% of the park is free...u pay for a small part of the park...so my advice is to skip this part if u have stroller...lots of Un even steps..u going to have to carry the stroller around",
          "I booked tickets online and selected a guided tour. For the guided tour we entered the park through the Carretera del Carmel entrance. As no one else booked the same time slot my husband and I lucked out and got a private tour. The tour lasted an hour and the guide was very",

We didn\u2019t realize that some of the famous Gaudi sites required admission, so keep that in mind. Only downfall- it is not a very accessible park for those with any",
          "Many people obviously enjoy this spot. One gets to see up close some of Gaudi\u2019s creations. with so many things to do in Barcelona, and the time commitment for this location, I would have preferred to skip this site. Lots of walking over terrain that is not for infirm or",
          "I took a bus up to Parc Guell, but hadn't done my homework, as you can't buy a ticket to the fancy areas on the door. There is still quite a lot parc to look at, so I did that. I was quite glad I hadn't bought a ticket, as there was construction (or conservation?) work going on",
          "Major construction going on....just ignore if you are hit by a spurt of water...smells vinegar & sticky...never give in to it...you will be robbed. We ignored the so called bird poop but came home & had to shower to remove all that stickiness & stain. Drastic security measures",
          "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this Gaudi masterpiece. We feel that we got the most out of our visit by doing the official guided tour. Our guide was not only knowledgeable about Gaudi and the history of the park, she was passionate too about imparting this",

          "Parc Guell\u2019s interesting and worth the effort if you\u2019re a fan of Gaudi\u2019s work. If not, skip it and the throngs of tourists taking selfies in the Monument Zone. Be advised that they are currently doing renovations on the central area so he views are somewhat impaired. Beware of",
          "I\u2019m a bit disheartened by the negative reviews of Parc Guell; but I experienced it in early morning and maybe that\u2019s the major difference.

          "Such a beautiful design for a whole town to be built. The fountains are decorated with colorful tiles, the benches are very comfortable to sit in, and the blend of color, nature and practical usage of the land is amazing. Walking in you pass 2 \"gingerbread-like\" houses that",
          "We weren't aware that when you buy tickets you're just sering a small part of the overall park, the rest is free. Two of the places in the paid for area were closed and lots of renovation/restoration work ongoing. Truthfully, not worth the money really which was a shame",
          "Go early, when the crowds are less. Public transportation available although you have to take both the subway and a bus (unless you wish to walk up a steep hill). Children will love this. I am making a book for my youngest granddaughter with some of the amazing details from the",

          "My husband and I walked up to Garcia where The Park is located. It was full for a tour, but walking the park without one is free. Be prepared to walk alot! It's all uphill but so worth the climb.",
          "Last time I was in Barcelona we tried to book ticket for Parc Guell and they had already sold out. This time we were quicker! In October it\u2019s a balance between booking far enough in advance to get tickets but not so far in advance that you can\u2019t check the weather! I was checking",
          "We ventured up the surrounding streets to the top of the parc. It is very steep and not recommended for anyone with trouble walking. Once at tth top, the views across the city are fantastic. See how impressive the Sagrada Familia from the viewpoints. The interesting structures",
          "This is a beautiful park, but crowded even in November. We walked their from El Raval. This was a very interesting walk and very doable. When we arrived, a local helped us find an entrance which was not clearly marked, but I think we may have arrived at one of the less used",
          "The park has a number of Gaudi buildings and art. The park is a tribute to him. It is on a hill so be prepared to walk if you want see everything. Best to book ahead of time.If you taxi over, they drop you off a short walk from the entrance. The Park area is free but if you want",
          "One of the early examples of Gaudi's genius, it also shows the push to develop Barcelona from a port city into something much more grand and European. Get tickets online--I think you can do a package with the Sagrada and save a few euros. Taking a city bus to the park is easy,",
          "After visiting Barcelona and seeing the unconventional architecture, which is prominent in Parc Guell, I fell in love with Antoni Gaudi style. It is so organic. The restricted area of the park is small, but definitely worth a visit - it feels like a fairy-tale. (Unless some",
          "This place is so beautiful. We have lived in Barcelona for 4 years and we love comming here for the view. Gaudis work here is off course also amazing",
          "Quite expansive. We didn't pay extra to go inside but we took a walk around it. Will visit again. Nice place.",
          "I had no idea what Parc Guell was. It just happened to be a stop on a day targeting the Sangrada Familia. In its time it was a failed real estate development by Gaudi and his mentor. But the park is full of interesting surprises in true Gaudi form. It should catch your",
          "Gorgeous building with fluid lines , vibrant colors and beautiful design ! He was definitely ahead of his time .",
          "This and the Segrada Familia are must sees on a Barcelona visit. Make sure you hike up to the top of the hill to see the flock of wild Parakeets in the trees there",
          "The park is huge and is a love place to see unique Gaudi architectures. it has music, harmony and of course Gaudi's signature all over. To catch a view of the city & ented the Gaudi Museum, you will have to pay, Influencers would pay for the view rather than the house.",
          "The main part of the park has all the wonderful whimsical Guadiana sculptures include a few buildings. Its fun for kids as well as for adults. Those with mobility problems might have trouble navigating the stairs and ramps so be forewarned.",
          "So interesting to see this place and be out in the gardens with beautiful views. Be prepared to walk alot and climb lots of stairs. If you like mosaics, dont miss this masterpiece.",
          "Ticket area hard to enjoy. Totally overcrowded by tourists who are not at all interested in details but only taking millions of same pics and selfies. Currently large parts not accessible due to (re)construction works. However, the biggest part of the park is still accessible",
          "Our first visit to Barcelona had to, of course, include working our way through at least the major Gaudi hot spots. Parc Guell was our last. Warning; pre-book online and do it at least a week prior to ensure you can get in at a time to suit you. Parc Guell wasn't my favourite",
          "Make sure you get tickets early in your trip because I missed out thinking I could get them same day. They only allow a certain amount of people at a time, so I understood but nonetheless disappointed. The beauty of the rest of the park grounds though are very alluring and",
          "Got a taxi which can\u2019t drive you to the entrance so steep walk up the last two blocks. People who have difficulty walking may find this place a struggle as still has many steps/hills to climb. Had a wander around for an hour but didn\u2019t think it was worth paying the \u20ac10 for one",
          "A lot of walking and not much to see. Not worth the money for admission. You can see the two main buildings from the street. That's about all there is to see. Long lines waiting to get inside. We hired a guide and did a lot of walking around the park on paths. Also lots of",
          "OK, so it's a lovely park but getting there its not easy. There is a substantial hill to climb. The park is very nicely done, but it's more of a insta park famous rather then famous for any great beauty. The royal park in Seville, much better.",
          "Magical place as if out of the fairytales this park combines the elements of nature with the beauty of Gaudi\u2019s architectural elements. It is truly unique place worth visiting for young and old, even children find it amazing. It is very touristy at the entrance - very crowded,",
          "We visited Parc Guell a couple of times and loved being able to wander around aimlessly viewing Gaudi's work. We did enter the ticketed area and I'd almost venture to say it isn't worth the ticket price at this time as they are currently doing construction. The construction",
          "It was worth while visiting but coming from the metro it was quite a long walk up to it. I felt it was probably not worth the money except that, I think this is important, they really need the money to make it better. In time it will be really worth a visit. I would suggesting",
          "While this is a very busy place, it is worth the time to enjoy the serpentine mosaics, the unusual structural elements mimicking nature (e.g. the supporting structures that could be mistaken for trees from the nature reserves in Australia!), and the unique spires and decorative",
          "it is very small park. Not so special. You pay 10 euros and you have 25 minutest things to see. Those things look great but not worth for the money..",
          "Well worth the visit, easy to get to on the Hop On Hop Off bus. Seriously do not miss the views available from here - there is a fee to enter the buildings but we simply enjoyed the park grounds. Easy to get to on the bus. One busker in the park who was playing drums was so",
          "It doesn't take long to walk around the restricted area of the park but it is very interesting and cool to see. Beware...this is up a hill, so walking there is a bit of a challenge. Also be sure to buy your ticket in advance as they do restrict the number of visitors and will",
          "It\u2019s beautiful but wouldn\u2019t recommend the far out travel for about 30 min clamber to get a photo next to a few spots waiting for others to get out the way ... didn\u2019t visit house as there was a waiting line of about 45 min It could be a worthy adventure if you pack a picnic for",
          "Park Guell is a bit out of the way so be aware. We were able to catch a shuttle bus from the metro to the entrance and back that was included with our tickets. Our tour guide was hard to follow as he had difficulty getting his point across. The tour itself was only 30 minutes",
          "We did an official group tour here and we would really recommend it. There is so much we would have missed just walking around with out it. I suggest getting to the park 45 minutes prior to the tour and walking around all the other parts, there is so much to explore. Barcelona",
          "Another Gaudi designed park and monuments . Crowded during the Halloween week, Pre-booked tickets are essential.",
          "Interesting, nice walk with great view of Barcelona. We did not have tickets because online shoed them sold out for a week. We went anyway and walked up yo admissions booth and were able to get in.",
          "Had a great hike with my family, wear comfortable shoes as it has steep climb and sandy footpaths. Was almost pickpocketed by 3 individuals working as a group. Beware of who walk behind you and always sling your bag forward. Otherwise nice sights at the guell",
          "Parc Guell is a unique experience, an outdoor park whose \"monuments area\" was designed by Gaudi and is full of interesting quirks and highlights. We especially enjoyed the Pathway of Columns, the stairway with the iconic Barcelona dragon, and the views over Barcelona to the sea",
          "Well worth the visit, Gaudi\u2019s park and palace are a great place for a walk in the city. Buy souvenirs at the park gift shop, where the prices and quality are better than the shops around the park.",
          "Husband and I are in our 60s and very agile. Still this was a trek if you were taking a bus or subway and had to hike up the hill. In our mind it was truly not worth the visit. This time of year in October we didn't see any flowers planted.absolutely agree with many of these",
          "We booked a tour that included Park Guell, Casa Batllo and La Sagrada. I definitely was concerned when we arrived because the young lady that was checking people in did not have a clue as to what she was doing. I was so happy when she put us into groups and we had Oliver as",
          "There isn\u2019t too much to see at this park and a big part of the park is under restoration. Is you are tight on time, I would skip this attraction. Definitely not a must see.",
          "again Gaudi....lovely park where you will enjoy walking in the middle of the nature and discover Gaudi sculptures, creations, mixing organic art and nature..stop for a coffee at the \"Font del gat\" ...and make a picture with the famouse \"lagarto\"(dragon)",
          "Neat thing to go see. We pre purchased tickets which made it easy. You do have to be there on time for the time slot you buy.",
          "The park is free and open, but the historical Gaudi section requires tickets. and they sell out on weekends. We did the group guided tour in English - which is 12 euro each on top of the 6 euro Gaudi section fee. Tickets are sold at the Paque du Carmel entrance - so head there",
          "There is no doubt that Parc Guell is located in a beautiful location and has lots of Gaudi influence. It's just that I was not overwhelmed by this attraction as I was with most other Spanish landmarks. If you have the time, I suppose the Park is worth the visit, although",
          "A great place to wander for the afternoon- fabulous views over Barcelona- hot tip- take a picnic there are no cafes- we wander round the free area only",
          "Our visit to Park Guell was nice. We did a guided tour. The mosaics on the benches and other pieces were incredible! Even the drainage for the benches were in mosaic! Such a wonderful spot to visit!",
          "Really nice to get out of the city and stroll. Amazing design and view. Really worth seeing even though it is a little way out.",
          "Parc Guell is definitely worth a visit. Unfortunately they were working on the benches when we visited the park. We have bought tickets online which was much easier.",
          "We walked all through the park, but did not pay to go into any of the Gaudi sites. Plenty of paths to wander along, places to sit and enjoy the sunshine and view, Outside of his works are easy to see, but we didn't feel the need to explore more. A long, but nice walk from El",
          "Beautiful park with Gaudi architechture. The benches were closed when we got there, which was unfortunate. High above Barcelona and some steep climbing. Wear comfortable shoes.",
          "We would have enjoyed more if the crowds were not so heavy and there were not so many pieces covered due to repair. The houses look like gingerbread houses and the detail work it amazing.",
          "Just did a walk around the free part of the park but had excellent views. Did have views of some of the Gaudi buildings.",
          "Hard to imagine, this place when it was built. At the time, it would have been very isolated on top of the Hill up from the city of Barcelona and hard to get to by horse and carriage. Probably why this exclusive \"estate home\" concept failed, too far back in the day from the",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the park very much. We bought the escorted tour tickets in advance and were glad we did because there would have been a long wait if we hadn't. We had an excellent guide.",
          "Gaudi\u2019s wild designs make the park feel surreal and magical. From the inside area full of pillars and mosaic ceiling, to the Hansel-and-Gretel-type buildings, as well as beautiful tile work all over the place, it\u2019s work paying to go and view, even with works going on to preserve",
          "Tickets bought from official website, if you decise to go book 3-4 days in advance. Tickets include the shuttle from Alfons X to the park and back. Currently the park is partly under reconstruction and some areas are not fully accessible. Despite the area itself is nice, the",
          "I had high expectations, bought tickets on the and went by foot all the way from the centre. Yes the nature is beautifull but I have seen beautifull nature. Yes Gaudis work is unique and exceptionall but then one should maybe visit one the houses he build. This place was",
          "The most lovely place. I felt like i was in Summer Wonderland! This place was created to exemplify the talent of the artist while taking advantage of the view and natural environment.",
          "Views and architecture and grounds were amazing. The band's were great entertainment while there. Just added to the excitement.",
          "Parc Guell was initially created as a \"gated community\" for the rich of Barcelona. Gaudi designed some of the architecture, specifically a couple of gatehouses and the main meeting area. If you like Gaudi, it's more of the amazing architecture that he's known for. However,",
          "We visited here last week but were disappointed. On arrival we were disappointed that we had to join a very long queue and the gaudi place was fully booked for another 4 hours. So we decided to walk around the free park which is pleasant with some spectacular vistas of Barcelona",
          "The only thing that impressed us the most was the sunset and the view, we went there at 5pm. If you have visited most places in Barcelona and if you love Gaudi, I guess you could pay a visit here. Otherwise, pretty much just a few things to look at only.",
          "The Guell Park is a quite small park and it won\u2019t take you more than an hour to visit it. Buy your tickets online because the amount of visitors is limited and you don\u2019t want to be disappointed at the entrance. The bus ticket from the metro station to the entrance is included in",
          "Allow at least 4/5 hours to truly enjoy this park. There is so much to see and enjoy and photograph. I could not see the very top part of the park but what I got to see was wonderful. Amazing building feats.",
          "We had to walk a distance up from the touristic bus stop as it locates up on the hill. So for someone that are not convenient on walking, may want to consider taking taxi or other method of transportation to go up. The structures of the buildings are intriguing, and the view",
          "Lovely expensive park that showcase Gaudi artistic vision. Feel like getting lost in a fairy tale among ginger bread house and castle. Ticket is timed and for main area. There is a shuttle bus that connects with the closest Metro station. You can walk but it's a steep hike.",
          "We honestly thought there would be more to see at the park. It was unique and had some good views from the hill that it's on, however MontJuic, which we toured the day before, was much more impressive. If you only have one day in Barcelona I'd say skip the park.",
          "Not very entertaining and is well overrated ,, very crowded and not organised ,, the map on the leaflet guide doesnt match what is really there",
          "It appeared a large portion was closed for renovation. Apart from the view at the TOP, I don\u2019t really see the attraction of this place. Yes, you get to see the famous lizard, some Gaudi-type buildings and structures. But that was about it.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a walk to get too but well worth it. There\u2019s plenty to see for free and you get great views across the city. The main entrance is spectacular and beautiful. Great place to sit and picnic too.",
          "I went on small guided tour and learned so much about the park and it\u2019s history. The park is stunning. The story behind the park is an interesting one. The architecture is fantastic. Worth going to.",
          "A nice parc, a must to visit in Barcelona, but not extraordinar. You have to make reservation \u00een advance to avoid the risk to not fi d tikets.",
          "Came here with a guide. Already prebooked tickets. I would have liked more time to explore it. It was not so crowded when we went so plenty of opportunities for photo. I need to go back again to see more.",
          "The park it\u2019s very large , Most of the park it\u2019s free of charge You Pay to see the Gaud\u00ed buildings , which during my visit were close for restauraci\u00f3n ( not all of them ). The area was packed with tourists ( we got there at 10am). Which made the visit even worst. In my",
          "As long as it\u2019s not raining this place is worth a visit but not suitable for anyone with mobility problems. Wear comfy shoes lots of walking and steep hills but worth it just to see the views",
          "We hired a guide to see Parc Guell who gave us a great insight into Gaudi's life. The architecture is out of this world and definitely out of the ordinary to see something unlike other places I have seen. There were a lot of tourists of which I expected for such an amazing",
          "Park G\u00fcell is worth a trip - especially if you take a guided tour. Marcel was our guide, and albeit highly stressed out due to his tight schedule, he still was very passionate about Gaud\u00ed and the park, so kudos here. Very nice view of the city and the sea.",
          "Recommend booking a tour with a guide to get skip the line access to the park. It is a great place to take pictures.",
          "Last time I came everywhere was open to all and had a great natural feel. Now they charge a lot to visit a building site with a few glimpses of Gaudi, mainly fenced off. Don't bother.",
          "We had booked the tour of Parc Guell and Sagrada Familias with Julia tours. The parc was stunning! Gaudi's mathematical, scientific mind was evident on the under story to all his buildings and the whole parc. Very good tour guide - Josep. Good sense of humour. Definitely",
          "From metro Lesseps it is still a fair walk to get to the park, mostly uphill. We arrived to find the ticket machines weren't working so couldn't get easy access to the museum area - probably best to book online before going. The park itself was OK - some nice views across the",
          "A def must see while in Barcelona. Great photo opportunities that really are original and intriguing. Climb to the top and enjoy the amazing views of the city.",
          "This park is beautiful, to say the least! The paths wind through a peaceful, serene park designed by Gaudi, even when full of people, because only about 400 people are allowed in at any time. The viaducts are fun because they are so different - no two columns are alike. The",
          "It\u2019s absolutely stunning here. This is the second time I\u2019ve visited. Unfortunately slots being restored just now but we can\u2019t let that put us off because the money from our tickets restores and maintains the park. It\u2019s a must see if your visiting the city",
          "Happy just to wander around this gorgeous park and skip all of the crazy busy spots. This park is beautiful, no ticket necessary to enjoy the sights and sounds of all the birds and stunning sea view:)",
          "I read a lot about Gaudi's influence on the city prior to my trip, and this seemed to be one of those must-see places. However, I wasn't that impressed (maybe I was missing something). It's a nice park, with interesting architecture, and an amazing view from the top of it.",
          "We grabbed a taxi (cheap and easy) to Park G\u00fcell, Gaudi\u2019s whimsical wonderland of mosaic benches, gingerbread houses, and dragon staircases with a fanciful lizard. The view of the city and the Balearic Sea are lovely. It helps to buy your timed tickets ahead of time online.",
          "I visit Park G\u00fcell every time I come to Barcelona and I love it! It\u2019s such an interesting looking park with so much to explore. However, you now have to pay to visit the Gaudi designed areas, and these areas are completely cut off from public view (so if you don\u2019t pay, you don\u2019t",
          "Loved the color and creativity of this place. A must see in Barcelona. I suggest you bring water but if you are adventurous you can buy from people selling at the entrances.",
          "Fabulous piece of architecture, a notable expression of the wish for representation and capital-city aspirations of the industrial elites of Barcelona",
          "While it's great that restoration work is underway it does make it difficult to enjoy the park and get any good photos but I guess it has to be done. We did a tour and though there were some interesting things we picked up from our guide I don't really think it was necessary to",
          "Very Seusssical designs (that's what I was reminded of anyway) interesting park that makes you feel like you're out of the city, but nice views of the Mediterranean and all of Barcelona. Lots of construction going on now though, so that obscures things a bit.",
          "Its a beautiful panoramic spot, good for early jogging and a break from the high grey walls. Dont worry about visiting without reservation. Dont even buy ticket to access the columns room, its gonna ruin the experience. Contra, too many silly lost tourists during normal daytime",
          "OK BUT didn\u2019t like the fact that you have to pay ( AGAIN ) to get into the house - that is a rip-off. I have been several times and upto six or so years ago it was free as this is a Public Park. Again book in advance ( about 10 Euros ) book days in advance because I felt sorry",
          "When you hear that Antoni Gaudi was involved in the design of this park you immediately take that bus to Park Guell and expect to be amazed but to be honest, in my opinion, the park is quite underwhelming. The least exciting of Gaudi's \"attractions\" in Barcelona, and even more",
          "Maybe I expected more, more colors, more vegetation. Due to reconstruction and Chinese or whatever invasion the park was hardly enjoyable. See my photo which depicts my moods. However I respect Gaudi\u2019s work, he was very talented, he is a great inspiration for me. Cheers!",
          "Don\u2019t get me wrong this is a cool park, but it isn\u2019t really close to anything else. Was somewhat underwhelmed after walking so far to get there",
          "The park is huge and free to get in. Park G\u00fcell is a public park system composed of gardens and architectonic elements located on Carmel Hill, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Wear good hiking shoes",
          "It reminds me of the studio of the Japanese artist Ghibli in Tokyo. If the tickets are sold out, just buy a tour. Very nice. Plan some time if you want to clime up the hill. The view is very good on the top:)",
          "Another stunning creative achievement by Gaudi. Beautiful, colorful movement in architecture..do not miss this!",
          "Don't miss this creative vision of suburbia! you will see the genius of gaudi and wonderful performers in the park",
          "Worth a visit However a long walk up the hill, Gaudi\u2019s house not to be missed . But try and get a taxi to the gate of the park",
          "It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of Gaudi's most artistic works. Don\u2019t be disappointed when you first look at this. You need to know (or understand Gaudi Architecture), of course, I don\u2019t understand that much and even I was a little disappointed what\u2019s",
          "I just love this park! The place is just amazing and breath taking. Beat the crowds and show up early!",
          "There are a million reviews about this place already. I can\u00b4t add any more. A must see. You can\u00b4t go to Barcelona and not go there.",
          "Surreal and prehistoric and a fairytale all wrapped together. It\u2019s an entirely unique park although it is a little crowded. Spend a couple hours strolling and admiring Gaudi's imagination. Many Instagram-able spots. Take the free (included with your pre-purchased admission",
          "What a special place. Gaudi's vision brought to life. It is magical. Get tickets before you even leave on your trip. They sell out fast. With the limited admission, 400 an hour, it was still very crowded. I don't care, it is worth the visit.",
          "Definitely worth the time and the price. Park had beautiful views with great architecture and artwork throughout. Would definitely recommend this experience.",
          "If you are patient and have an hour or two to burn, this is fine to visit for a modernista inspired park. However, it is very touristy and crowded, and is actually only a small part of the overall Parc. Between posing tourists who ask you to move away so they can pose their girl",
          "Beautiful views of the City on a clear day. We did the tour they offered - which I would highly recommend. I don't thing you'd get nearly as much out of it on your own.",
          "Visiting at sunrise = free entrance before ticket booth is open (at 8am) + less visitors to block views on your selfies! Also, the climb to a side entrance of the park coming from the nearest subway station waa a great morning work out when the sun hasn\u2019t heat it up yet.",
          "A wonderful combination of landscaped gardens and the modern art and architecture of the collaborators who planned and built it, with a vision for this to be a common style of living. If you like the general style of colourful tiles and curved walls, patterned ceilings and an",
          "Parc Guell is a stunning place and lovely to walk around but sadly even on the morning we were visiting I couldn't book tickets for the pay area. I need to be far more organised next time!",
          "Having already visited the parc a number if years ago, the parc itself is just as magical as I remember. Large sections of the parc are now cordoned off to paying customers only, different from when I last visited. Understandable to raise funds, though a shame to limit some from",
          "Was really looking forward to visiting but was disappointed. Too many people and renovations going on which was annoying as when I pre booked the tickets online we were not advised these would be taking place. I would personally give this place a miss and maybe go up to Tibidabo",
          "A beautifully, well designed park. It is stunning. We visited in October, 2019, and many parts were under restoration, but that didn't hinder our visit.",
          "We bought a ticket ahead of time, Its a must to book your ticket in advance make yourself stress free, Going to the Parc Guell kinda challenging its a long way walk, located on Carmel Hill, prepare to have a comfy sneaker with you.. But once you reaches the park G\u00fcell all worth",
          "I was glad we read the reviews online as we knew there are renovations going on so only a small section of the famous mosaics are visible and only if you purchased a ticket which were sold out when we arrived. We chose just to tour around the free section of the park which was",
          "We had had our fill of Gaudi so chose to walk the park admiring the view of Barcelona and the mis of shrubs and flowers.",
          "Beautiful place, with aid of our tour guide we were able to get so much more out of our visit. Interesting history!",
          "Such a cool place to be and to visit! Don\u2019t miss it! There are two parts: one paid and one free! We only had the time to do the paid part which was absolutely amazing! Definitely check it out!",
          "The ticket included Bus Guell, which was well sign posted from the me, and was easy to use with voucher. It took me a while to find the correct entrance for my ticket. I was early, but was allowed straight in, and given a map. There was quite a lot of construction going on,",
          "You must pre-book tickets to this place but even that does not stop it being hugely busy. Big crowds and quite a queue to look around the house but it is well worth it - there are views that are amazing and it is impossible not to love the place. There are some building works in",
          "This place is nice especially if you enjoy architecture and gardens , or if just want to see some nice views and take nice pictures but , get tickets or else you can only enjoy the gardens on the exterior of the park although they are still nice but not as nice as seeing all of",
          "It is such a beautiful place! You can get a lot of great pictures there! But go prepared to walk a lot and take some water with you. What kills the place is the fact that now you have to pay to access one area. Not only pay, you have to schedule in advance. Even though, I think",
          "I'm sure this is a beautiful spot but it is hard to tell through all the people (and I'm didn't visit during peak season so I can't imagine how bad it gets). I went at 10 am and it was overrun with student groups who clearly were not interested in the park. A bunch of areas",
          "We ended the day here yesterday. Beautiful Park, lots of walking may not be for everyone. May be better at other times of the year when there is more in bloom.",
          "We took the tourist bus to get here, it was still a long walk from the stop. However this is obviously one of the key sites for a Barcelona visit. You need to book ahead to get in the restricted area and are given a half hour entry slot, but you can stay as long as you need.",
          "You MUST go to Park Guell early or you will experience crowds. Be sure to catch the metro, then the Park Guell bus. The bus will drop you off with just a short walk to the entrance to the park. Check your online ticket for the bus information. The sunrise is beautiful over",
          "Disappointed! Paid a lot to get tickets, had to walk about half a mile straight uphill just to get there, but once inside much was closed off due to construction or renovation. I felt ripped off, because I got charged full price but could only visit about half that wasn't roped",
          "I loved this and Casa Batllo if you are interested in Gaudi and art I think they are a must do on your trip. The views are amazing and it was worth the money. I liked seeing Gaudi's home and it gave you an insight into his earlier life.",
          "The Park itself is stunning. Expansive areas to explore with amazing views and great scenery. The park was sold out on the day I visited and was under construction, so very little was visible. I highly recommend getting your ticket prior to venturing out.",
          "Booked an 8:30 am tour and it was already crowded due to bus tours. It was fun to see but tough to photograph due to netting on many structures.",
          "The tour was very nice and Alex, our tour guide did a wonderful job explaining the history of the area; but, we were expecting quite a bit more of the work of Guide, nice to visit though, just not what we expected.",
          "Disappointed by my latest visit to Parc Guell due to all of the construction going on. Still a good experience, but would recommend you temper your expectations.",
          "We walked from our hotel about a mile to get to Parc Guell, The walk itself was also very cool, lots of stairs going up the hill. If you look at a map, on the east side of the park is a hilltop with 3 crosses, great views from the top. There were also a few colorful performers",
          "Parc Guell is a phenomal piece of artwork and is a must see while in Barcelona. We visited this site with five children ages 2-11 and a stroller. Anything less will be a breeze! The tricky part is getting there. The city has a dedicated shuttle bus that runs between Parc",
          "A little disappointed with our visit to Parc Guell this time as there was a great deal of refurbishment work that restricted access to parts of the park and the noise and dust did not help either. It would have been useful if when we booked the tickets at the Park we were told",
          "Although the tour company was great and the property very nice to visit, we found the lack of getting into the buildings on the grounds to be somewhat disappointing. The outside areas especially the rock work is something to see. Visit but plan plenty of other things to do in",
          "The view and the art combine to make this stop just a lovely afternoon. It\u2019s a busy spot with tourist but easily walked since people can spread out in this park setting. A gift shop and small caf\u00e9 are on site if needed. Public bathroom as well.",
          "It\u2019s before the Gaudi house and once you walk through the parc and visit the Gaudi parc amd house you cant walk back through. This parc is a disgrace. I was shocked at the number of guards being paid to keep you away after you walk to the Gaudi house where the beautiful grounds",
          "We are glad we went, we enjoyed the walk and the sites, but it wasn't as nice as we thought it would be. The online pix don't show the huge open mud/sand area and all the construction material. The mosaic wavy bench and the views of the houses were cool, but the rest was just",
          "This park was smaller than I thought (and a bit further from a metro stop than I thought). It was really interesting to see all of the different architectural features. We didn't want to wait in line to see the little houses. It's nice that you can walk around at your own pace.",
          "We took a tour and wondered why. This is just a really nice and unique place to spend a couple of hours and relax.",
          "The park was over rated. It was over packed with rude tourist of a certain nationality that I will not mention. Chaos in areas where you would want a photo, and just very frustrating in general. Not worth the time or $ in my opinion",
          "This park by Guidi is interesting to visit but there is a lot of stairs to climb.Once you leave you can't get back in.",
          "Did not expect what we saw before going into the park, the whole philosophy was great, too bad it never worked out. But the whole thing is fascinating, the mosaics, the columns, the slanted hallway, just wonderful to visit.",
          "Visited here with friends on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing really exciting about it as lots of the art is covered in scaffolding. Distraction on the exit stairs resulted in my friend losing her cash. Keep your belongings safe and be very aware of people around you",
          "Getting to Parc Guell is simple - if you have bought your timed ticket on line, get the L4 metro to Alfons X. You can then get on the complimentary Parc Guell bus, which takes you up the steep hill to the entrance to the Parc. You have access to a vast wooded park that is free",
          "This park was created by Gaudi, around his house. It's something original, by Gaudi's inspiration. Worth's to see it but attention better buy tickets online because at the place you might have a lot of time to wait.",
          "Me and my friend was there to just walk around and it's very lovely. There were more places that you needed to pay for before you could go there. We didn't and you could find other places where you get some of the same views. We wanted to go and see the Casa del Guarda and the",

          "Go early in the morning, before the park is full of people. We visited the park around 8.30 and get to see the sunrise. In addition, less people in the park, we can take better picture.",
          "Gaudi's innovations and architectural achievements are a sight to behold. We had an excellent guide who showed us the highlights and explained its origin. A must-see!",
          "If you like Gaudi, go there! But it's better to buy tickets earlyer and to have a guide. We have a smart and funny one, and that was priceless!",

Later it's amazing to walk just in free area. We bought tickets online, which included also transfer. Good option, but no guarantee to get a free place in a bus. Super escape from hot coast!",
          "It was beautiful, the park itself before paying to get into the middle section was absolutely beautiful lots of stairs or up hill walking to get to the view points but stunning once you're at the top. The architecture is amazing",

You can buy a ticket to walk on the inside of the park and to sit on the park benches that appear in many photos. We decided to not buy tickets, but still got to experience much of the beauty!",

If you want smooth experience BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE!!!\nNo bars/cafes in the gardens outside, so literally not too much to do while waiting.",

There are multiple entry points and unless you go in via the main park entrance, its not easy to navigate your way round the park which is huge",

          "Very beautiful park. And the cafe actually serves good food for a quick serve restaurant. Architecture is as amazing as one would expect. I did feel 10 euros was a bit to much for a place I walked through in only 30 minutes. I passed on Gaudis apartment. The wait was nearly an hour",

          "Must-visit in Barcelona. You could easily spend a whole day here, but at least make time to spend a couple of hours. So much great outdoor space to just stroll around while taking in the incredible architecture. The neighborhood on the way down hill is pretty neat as well and plenty of restaurants within walking distance.",

Wheelchair accessible entrance and parking. Restaurants around this place are also nice and not that expensive so everyone can eat.",

          "I loved my jogs to the park and around the paths in the park when I was younger in the 1980's. It was never crowded that I can remember.  I loved Gaudi's touch of art on everything. There were lots of waist high walls and quaint paths where I could compliment my work out with leg stretches. It was a special place that I called my own.",

          "To be very honest I don\u2019t see what all the fuss is about. if you are into art and history then please visit but if you are a traveler and are curious then there may be a possibility for you to spend your time elsewhere.",
          "Fresh air. Nice view.",
          "Unfortunately we didn\u2019t know how popular this was and that tickets needed to be booked in advance. Lesson learnt- Plan ahead. \nIt was quite a walk up as well, so luckily we were still able to walk around some parts and see the fantastic view of Barcelona.",

Waited 2 hours for a park the size of my house I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth paying for it it should be free there\u2019s really 2-3 things to see which you can see from the outside \nDon\u2019t get me wrong everything pretty and cool but not worth waiting 1-2 hours and paying for it",
          "The access to the park is very well organized to avoid overcrowding. There are recommended tour routes that start at the Nature Square and end near the Gaudi museum building. Plan your visit well as the entry to the regulated zone is timed but also visiting the rest of the park is worth it.",
          "Lack of signage to buy tickets, horrible queue and nothing much to see except a few mosiac tiles building. I think the Cathedral of Barcelona is far better choice than this park.",

We went in the afternoon but if I went again I\u2019d like to go first thing in the morning as it was fairly crowded during our visit.  They do have wheelchairs available for rent if needed.",

          "Great place for walks in nature. The Park itself which costs 10 euros is just 2 houses - not worth the money unless you're an art fan. Enjoy!",
          "A special place to visit. We didn\u2019t find anything to eat in the surroundings so go there after you ate! You can easily spend 4 hours in this lovely place. Also the paid area becomes free after 18:15.",
          "Every vantage point to see the houses was roped off. You had to pay to see anything. The park itself was nice though and there were some other things to see. But don't expect a pretty view of the gaudi architecture without having to park with your cash.",
          "Tourist trap. Paid 8 euros to see a building site. The best part is Gaudis house but this is a separate ticket. While under refurbishment not worthy a paid visit. The views can be appreciated from the outside which is free anyway.",
          "Awesome historical and tourism place. I see look like bali temple level here.",
          "Nice Park area. Its \u20ac10 to enter only a small part of the park but you can easily walk around the rest and see the Gaudi buildings (from a distance) without paying",
          "The free part of the park is more beautiful then the one they charge. Also, you buy tickets, pay full price and more then half of the paths are closed. Staff pretty rude commenting tourists around them and thinking they don't understand them. The nature and sculpture are beautiful. \nGreeting from \"expensive\" Croatia!",
          "Beautiful sites. But you need to pay 10\u20ac to get to the popular part as it\u2019s closed off. Also no parking near by so you need to leave your car in central Barcelona and walk.",
          "You can get a nice view of the beautiful city of Barcelona!",
          "This park has a free section, which is a bit of a climb, but quite nice to visit. You can walk around the entire paid section and see parts of it, but to actually get in you must make an online reservation and wait for your time slot. If \u2026",

Park of the park is restricted and you have to pay to go in, but there is still a large portion of the park that you can see free of charge! Picnic benches dotted around and toilets (only in one place as far as I saw)",
          "29 AUG. 2019 Sunny morning v went there and get in park before 07:30 so free of charge to play around here. There are very good sun light when it just come out. You will wonder that how was his thinking to create all playful house. Even so \u2026",
          "Beautiful views and park. The monumental part is surely nice if you reserved your tickets in advance. It was a bit too much street sellers and musician for my taste.",
          "You could spend hours in this artwork. Loved walking through the park and appreciating all the work and effort that has gone into creating such an amazing space. There is soo much to appreciate here you just need to get lost in here. There are food and drink facilities near by. Hard to get lost but people are really helpful and friendly",
          "Decent view of Barcelona from the top of a hill. Free entry to the park itself and easy enough to arrive by either bus or metro.",
          "The must see place in Barselona. You can see there architecture of Antonio Gaudy. Mosaic lizard and more. Do not buy souvenirs at the store at park because they are way over priced. You can find another store just across the street and there it will be much cheaper.",
          "If you can time this right between tour buses, it's not overly crowded. Little smaller then I thought it would be, but very cool place to check out.",
          "Great place but the paying part is always crowdy, need to book before.\nIf you go off the schedules given its free but it's usually night time \nAlso there's works in here right now so not everything is open, check on website before",
          "The park is amazing much more than I expected. Really worth pay to go inside. Is so beautiful.",
          "The park is beautiful and different. As such it is enjoyable and calm. The entry tickets for the special area for 10\u20ac is pricy and at best avoidable. The famous lizard/ reptile is not worth that much. The beautiful building can be seen from the street itself if you take correct road from bud stop.",
          "I visited the park in the last September , Great place  if you come in Barcelona don\u2019t miss it \nNice place to walk around and clear your mind from street noise",
          "It was like going back to those years, clean water, excellent public transportation and the family Church, awsome! Just looking from outside, many people standing on line.",
          "Park is nice. Paid part is hard to get into (only 400 peoples per 30 minutes) and all non-paid view places are intentionally closed. If you want to see everything, buy tickets online and get here at specific time.",
          "Amazing unique park designed by famed Catalan architect Gaudi. Initially designed as a home for a wealthy patron, the park is now open to the public. If you want a beautiful sunset spot, hike to the hill above Park Guell (~ 10 minutes, paved ).",
          "Beautiful park but too crowded... it's a good example of how tourism can put to its limits a place that was never thought to be a mass touristic destination",
          "The paid area is very cool. Spent about 45 minutes admiring all of the work. Great view from up above and beautiful mosaics. A little expensive but it\u2019s a must a see. Gift shops just outside the park are cheaper.",
          "Did not go to the paid area, the free parts kept me busy enough! Great view at the top, that's really what I wanted. Lots of cool musicians playing at the different areas.",
          "Amazing park with stunning views. Good for hikes, walks and picnic. Definitely check out the monuments in the park- small price.",
          "This used to be one of my favourite places in Barcelona and I remember walking around happily and buying jewellery from vendors in the park. Now, it seems you have to pay depending where you stroll, there are barriers and checkpoints and \u2026",
          "Beautiful spot but our tour didn't allow for much wandering about or exploration. Very busy even in this off season, must be manic in the summer!",
          "Beautiful place, worth the visit",
          "Absolutely beautiful, something you can't see anywhere else. Gaudi work is amazing, I definitely recommend this place when in Barcelona.",
          "Wonderful park from the ever genius Gaudy.  Well worth going and spending the morning. One star lost as only some of the escalators leading to the entrance were working and my elderly parents-in-laws struggled quite a bit. Also, charging 10 euros per person to visit some of the most interesting features of the park is a robbery.",
          "Park G\u00fcll is a must-see in Barcelona!\nIt it\u2019s very beautiful with great views, and a lot of colors. Also fantastic architecture.\nGreat please to visit with families and friends.\nMake sure to book tickets in advance, and bring water since \u2026",
          "Beautiful park! Definitely worth to go in the paid part of it. But be sure to get tickets beforehand since it's probably already full for the day.",
          "Amazing to think that someone had such a different idea of construction in the late 1800s. We are lucky to be able to see these unique buildings! This is a definite must see when in Barcelona. Some of the courtyard walls were undergoing \u2026",
          "Great place to walk and have a picnick. Beware of rats although. The entry ticket to monument part of the park is a little overpriced. Better to get in advance",
          "Park G\u00fcell is magical, beautiful and an all-around wonderland of stunning-mosaic-creativity! Get some culture and add some adventure to your life while taking a stroll around Park G\u00fcell. I recommend it to singles, doubles, trios, and so on. \u2026",
          "Would recommend the park area that does not require a ticket to enter. You can see the architecture and view of the city from there. The ticketed area itself - balcony and the smaller museums - was somewhat anticlimactic given the price due.",
          "An interesting park of quirky design! does not offer too much, but the ticket price is not too high so it is not bad to stretch your legs while walking in a completely unusual park",
          "Definitely one of the landmarks you need to visit in Barcelona, easy to get to by Metro. Amazing views of the beautiful Catalonia city",
          "Very pretty. A free game and a paid game that is worth the effort for a correct price (express metro bus included in the ticket price which is very good). A lot of people so plan to buy the ticket online before coming to avoid finding \u2026",
          "Unbelievable place \u2764\ufe0f my heart is still in that place. If you go to Barcelona you must visit Parc G\u00fcell. It's pure magic\u2764\ufe0f",
          "One of my favorite parts in Barcelona. Lots to see and do. Be prepared for lots of walking and uphill climb if you want to get to the top to get an amazing panoramic of the whole city.",
          "We arrived by foot, because that is what google maps recomended, it was too complicated. Very steep roads. The free part of the park is fine, there are some spots where you get a nice view of Barcelona. But the paid part was too expensive. 10 Euros for watching some figures? no thank you.",
          "It's a really neat park with lots of follies.  I dont recommend paying to enter the closed section. You can see much of it from the outside and you won't have to wait in line for hours then wait some more for your designated time.  Also, very out of the way with no easy access point.",
          "If you are a morning person, better go to the park before the sun rise. You can enjoy beautiful views of Barcelona. Plus, it\u2019s not too crowded in the morning. It\u2019s the best place to start your journey in Barcelona.",
          "The view was breathtaking. Can't wait to come again",
          "Just WOW - beautiful Place!",
          "Looks a lovely park just the day we went it was so hot with kids tagging along we didn\u2019t really get a chance to see everything but what we did see it was lovely. Worth a visit. People selling all kinds of things/trinkets etc on the ground \u2026",
          "I went there with my friend to spend some time...nice cozy place...awesome place ....really amazing view of the whole city...very green place...would love to visit again if i go back to Barcelona...peaceful place...also you can get a bus \u2026",
          "A unique artistic expression in the heart of the city. Lots of tourists - thankfully there was a cart in the middle of the park that served beer on this warm day! Beautifully designed and well looked after.",
          "We really liked the free part of the park. It is really beautiful and calm. Recommend. The pictures have been taken in the end of September.",
          "Wonderful location you shouldn\u2019t miss it when you visit Barcelona.\nVery good place for kids.\nSpread history with lots of details.\nMosaic-covered buildings, steps & sculptures in verdant park with Gaudi museum & panoramic views.\nDesigned by Gaud\u00ed",
          "It's great for a nice long walk. It's been touched by Gaudi's extraordinary architectural style so parts of the park are like a fairy tale.",
          "Incredible! Lots of people though and it is under renovation so lot of it is covered. Still absolutely worth it but you have to book weeks in advance to get in.",
          "very Famous visting place and it will be free after 9pm and before 8 am. take the subway is very easy to reach. It will take 20 or25minutes to visit",
          "Pretty much like anything else Gaudi in Barcelona...a building site. It's cool and worth a visit but...",
          "It's an amazing place, it's hard to miss it when visiting Barcelona. It's colourful and unique kind of place, there is nowhere else you can find such place in the world. Beautiful park and beautiful view of Barcelona as well.",
          "Loved the creativity and appearance of the place. Views of the city and coast were great too.",
          "Perfect place to start the day! They have a medium sized cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Great architecture and so much to look at. Sucks it\u2019s under construction, but understandable.",
          "Very crowded and full of junk sellers. Someone also was trying to pickpocket us.\nOn the good side once you go up the hill there\u2019a a nice view.",
          "Interesting and unique place, that all must see in Barcelona.\nI recommend to all. Important advise: buy the tickets online. It's the same price as in the classes, but you skip the lines and schedule your visit ahead.",
          "Somewhat bonkers, somewhat mystical, completely amazing. Well worth a visit. Book ahead so as not to be disappointed.",
          "It\u2019s overpriced to be honest but it\u2019s a beautiful park. Explore all the areas, take the bus because it\u2019s up on the hill. You need to book in advance.",
          "Amazing views of Barcelona. Unique and colorful structures. Bring your most comfortable walking shoes.",
          "Always a good place walk around. Not sure its worthy to pay. The free part is pretty big to visit.\nReally lovely place to visit and spend some time.",
          "A very beautiful historical place. And you can take very beautiful Photos especially Instagram Pictures.",
          "I love the view from this park. It is a great place to take a stroll and enjoy the birds singing.",
          "The place is amazing! Lots and lots of activities for kids! Well worth the visit!",
          "A wonderful place to spend a morning or afternoon.  Scenic, work many photo opportunities.  The Gaudi house is well with seeing for the examples of furniture, the views and the interiors.\n\nWalking around the park is good exercise at there's lots of stairs and inclines.",
          "Very pretty. Most of the park is free but if you want to see the iconic benches or lizard that is 10 euros. Only buy tickets through their site.",
          "Beautiful place with amazing views of the city. A real master piece by Gaudi, a most visit without any doubt.",
          "Tribute to Gaudi's brilliance. Stunning view towards Sagrada Familia cathedral from the park.  The Park is in and of itself a work of Art. Architecture is just sublime. Lovely place to spend a few hours. Its a must see in Barcelona",
          "Great part of this park that is overlooked, is the positioning of the park as it overlooks some of the city. INteresting facts related to this park which made it also more interesting as we toured. Great colors, and altough lots of people, \u2026",
          "Pretty park. I\u2019m happy that I went to see it. I would\u2019ve been happier if they gave a discounted ticket considering they were doing renovations and there are parts you can\u2019t see well. Also I didn\u2019t enjoy the cafe on premises. Not \u2026",
          "It\u2019s hard to see the cool buildings and mosaics and other interesting art exhibits because of all the people taking photos of themselves right in front of it. It\u2019s a shame that places like this have now become saturated with instagrammers \u2026",
          "Fabulous guided tour of this unique park. Lots to see and find out about this garden city. Lots of tourists but such a big space you can easily find some places of peace.",
          "Very large park. It is relaxing to have awalk, even when it is crowded. The architecture and artsy part is interesting, but they usually have sites that are under construction. We've seem a lot of birds, including parrots, luxuriant \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning park, lots to walk through with different vibes. Although you can see the paid section from the public areas, I still recommend paying for it to see it up close and get those iconic photos",
          "Very nice but you have to pay for the terrace and other parts. The tickets sold out early so it's better to buy the tickets online in advance",
          "It's a nice and beautiful park, where you will find the house of Gaudi surrounded of is amazing works. I was just disappointed because I find out the most beautiful part from the park you must pay to visit 10 euros, when the park should be public... Barcelona is getting quite expensive to visit \ud83d\ude14",
          "A wonderful experience, good value and a pleasant visit. The background history and its unique mosaics are all things not to miss",
          "Park guell is one of its kind. I was in awe to see such rich architectural heritage of Barcelona. Designed by the famous architect Goudi, this is a beautiful park with such intricate work of art all over the park. Some parts of the park are free and some are paid. It's a fun place to visit with kids.",
          "A beuatiful place to visit! The road until the top is not that hard, nice view, nice environment and amazing architecture! Colorful place to be with family and friends.",
          "I highly recommend going all the way up there for this beautiful view! It was magnificent \u2764",
          "I mean, it\u2019s just not as impressive as you would imagine. Perhaps over the years I\u2019ve built it up too much in my head, but it looks better in pictures than in reality. Perhaps the overcrowding and poor signposts add to it, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the \u20ac10 entrance. Could be wrong though!",
          "Get a tour guide! So many important details! Simply amazing!",
          "We woke up at 7:00am and took the metro, which I think wherever you are it would take you the same amount of time around 25 minutes to get there.\n\nBefore 8:30am it's free, and not crowded as it gets during the day (that's what people say) \u2026",
          "This is an amazing place! You have to visit it and enjoy its magic.",
          "Lots to see and do, nice walks to the top overlooking the cathedral. Worth the wait to go in.",
          "Love Park Guell, went there during December and it was full, but not crowded and we can get pictures easily. The view is amazing and structures are beautiful. Would definitely recommend.",
          "I really liked the free part of the park. The paid park is in my opinion to touristic. Lots of people standing in the way just to make a foto. So I wouldn\u2019t recommend the payed part if you don\u2019t like tourism",
          "Wonderful park with great view of the city. Worth purchasing the ticket to view Gaudi's art close up.",
          "10 euro for one person is a rip off in the park which should be free to begin with. Also you can enter and enjoy most of it without any fees. Renovations were taking place but even wihout the renos, this park should be absolutely free.",
          "Simply amazing creativity on display.  Be sure to get your tickets ahead of time, especially if you want to catch the park's bus from the subway. Otherwise it is a long walk.",
          "One of the most amazing parks in Spain! \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 beautiful architecture + nature = win! And the views from up top are astonishing! Good hike too",
          "Beautiful park, but book your tickets ahead of time to guarantee attendance. If you cannot get a ticket for park entrance, you can walk around go to the Gaud\u00ed house museum at the top of the park. It's \u20ac5, a quick visit, but beautiful and educational.",
          "Loved this place. Antoni Gaudi'd organic architecture is truly mind blowing and eye opening. Get there early and buy online tickets in advance to beat queue and to take pics with less people in your immediate surrounding. It was already full at noon in January... I can imagine the chaos in the high season. Be aware of this.",
          "It was a beautiful park. Lots to see with and without a ticket. Word of advice - purchase a ticket ahead of time. Also, don't walk to it (it's exhausting).",
          "If you arrive from the rear, there's a whole load of steps. Google takes you to that popular route. However, a street over, there is a path with escalators. (If they work...). Take that instead. Or ensure you arriv from the main entrance. It'll still be a slope but more gentle.",
          "Oh my goodness!!!!! Beautiful! Take few sandwiches and drink you can just sit and absorb the scenery!",
          "Neat park at the top of Madrid with the works of Gaudi. Maybe not worth paying as much for the monumental zone (hence the three stars) but I can see the attraction.  Went in the off season and still swamped with tourists so impossible to get good shots of the work unless showing up at sunrise.",
          "Amazing Parc. We loved every bit of it. Staff was nice as well. Its not really pushchair friendly but they give you a meal with a route to use with it. Everyone should go there",
          "There are two areas inside the park: one restricted (you have to pay for a ticket, in order to enter), one free for all.\n The restricted area of Park G\u00fcell was extremely crowded and - at some point we couldn't see anything but a mass of \u2026",
          "Loved it. Great place for a walk and the bus ride there was quite an adventure.",
          "The park has free and paid zones, the paid zone contains most of Gaudi\u2019s works that are \u201cmust see\u201d. Book tickets online as the park management limits the number of visitors for each time-slot of the day to avoid overcrowding. There are \u2026",
          "This is a place to admire an authentic work of a  genius of the modern architecture. The work of Gaud\u00ed is amazing.",
          "Fantastic park with great view of all of Barcelona. The Gaudi architecture was interesting as well.",
          "The best way I can explain this park is essentially a Disneyland from the early 1900s for those with a slightly more sophisticated pallet!\nIf you are familiar with some of Gaudi\u2019s work you\u2019ll understand what I mean because of his general \u2026",
          "Amazing views but either go on a clear day or early in the morning. You can walk to the top of the hill. We never spent the extra to see Gaudi's stuff. Not worth it.",
          "Paid for the entrance to a strange museum. Could have just come by early to walk the park which is free and undisturbed. There is no need to pay for the ticket to come sees",
          "Nice park, didn't get to view it all though, amazing view of Barcelona from the top. We didn't sit on the bench which you have to pay to take a photo on though as we couldn't find it.",
          "Long walk, but worth the trip. Beautiful view overlooking Barcelona",
          "A must watch in Barcelona. The park is huge and be prepared to walk a lot.. great views of the city and grand architecture in the park to see. I didn't cover the paid portion due to time constraint.",
          "Wonderful view and weather in the city. Make sure to buy tickets in advanced since they run out and so buying them there is not available. Bring snacks and make a great family picnic out of it :)",
          "Marvelous... The park itself is amazing, you could see Barcelona city from up there, good transportation and Gaud\u00ed everywhere... Fully recommended.",
          "You don't need to pay the ticket to enjoy the park! The area they give you access is kinda reduced and you can still get almost the same view from the part for people not paying the ticket which is like the whole rest of the park. Amazing place as you can expect, can't miss it!",
          "Very nice and neat park, lots of entertainers, large and beautiful area.  You do not have to go straight to buy a ticket for a paid part.  The park is big enough to enjoy free admission as well.",
          "Our tour guide Maya (?) (sorry, I'm sure that's not the correcr spelling!) for the English was very knowledgeable and engaging. The place was a bit crowded but each person gets an earpiece so you can hear the guide at all times. It has an \u2026",
          "Nice Place with a lot of Detail. But you have to buy a ticket for the best places.",
          "Very cool place to visit! Beautiful views.",
          "It's very nice and scenic but the tickets to view guells historic home were not worth it and the private areas were the same as the park only closer to view points. Not worth the tickets but worth going in the free sections",
          "Good picnic spot ! There was a live group performing music and dance which made the place lively. There are good spots for pictures . Points from which whole Barcelona can be seen. It's wide spread , do check the map and chalk out the area you keen on to see in the park.",
          "You need a lot of free time, because the park is big and beautiful.  I liked musicians who played there. And you also can take pleasure from the beautiful views of Barcelona",
          "I\u2019d recommend visiting even without a ticket, great little area to walk around and enjoy a snack and take some fun pictures! If you visit on the weekends when it\u2019s more busy you\u2019ll sometimes get local musicians performing which is way fun to see!",
          "I don\u2019t need to tell you that you need to come here if you are in Barcelona, so come here. \n\nBe mindful of the ticket time. There is a free section and paid section. All the good parts are in the paying section, however, they only selling \u2026",
          "Beautiful park with a great view over the city. Its also a good opinion to enjoy and forget the city trouble.",
          "Beautiful Park with beautiful art. Unfortunately you have to pay \u20ac10 entrance to see the art up close which is ridiculous and spoils the fun completely.\nTo bad it used to be free before.",
          "Although I am sure it is an amazing place to visit, trying to find the ticket office is like looking for a needle in a hay stack? Also do not attempt to visit if you have any mobility problems, as the access was certainly not designed with these people in mind!",
          "Fantastic parc. The structures at the lower section are the main attractions, but can be quite busy even in the early morning. I loved the more tranquil and scenic sections of the parc at the higher levels. The views on Barcelona are stunning.",
          "One of the coolest sights in the city! An absolute must-visit. These sculptures and gardens are absolutely stunning, and so cool, too!",
          "massive vision of one man brought to life. very polite & tolerant staff. Must visit",
          "Park G\u00fcell was very nice, entrance 10 \u20ac per person, but if you don't want to go to \"main exposition\", it is free.",
          "The grounds are free to walk around & get to see some of Goudi's wildly extravagant Architectural art and the unique way he assembled natural features like random rocks!",
          "The sunrise is incredible. I recommend that you watch the sunrise!!!:))",
          "Remarkably place. Worth every money. In February not so crowdy.",
          "The general admission tickets were sold out (seemed weird, but okay...) so we did a guided tour. We were really glad we did! We would not have understood & appreciated what was there if we hadn't! It was raining, which stinks, but it actually allowed us to see things better because it wasn't crowded!",
          "View from this place is awesome. Gaudi\u2019s best construction. You cannot get a close time ticket online for this place.",
          "I enjoyed this, but if I'm completely honest, the paid ticket was unnecessary for me. There's an upper terrace that you can access where you can view everything for free. If you like to get up and personal to things then go ahead and grab the ticket. The majority of the area is free though anyway.",
          "Free entry before 8h30 (opening hour) in December. Nice walk and nice light for great photos. Not crowded as well !",
          "Nice Park, relatively crowded so if you want to see the inner parts with the buildings it's recommended to book in advance but the rest that you can visit for free is also great. There's some amazing views over the city, picnic tables and an interesting mixture of nature and architecture.",
          "it was good but very confusing to roam around..one big board with clearly written with arrow marks would help for foreign tourists... we were asking other tourists,they were asking us...not good....",
          "The view and the park are great, usually really crowded. Easy to understand why it's a must to visit.",
          "Beautiful but please get rid of the souvenir sellers. Constant noises of bird whistles. Imagine what it would be like without?",
          "Great views but I did not know you have to pay to get into the 'iconic area'. This was an upsetting new scheme which I didn't really expect. You can still catch amazing views though but be sure to pay for the ticket if you want to go inside.",
          "Don\u2019t forget to explore the rest of the Park, outside of the paid Gaudi zone. You can hike all the way up for excellent views of the city, and it\u2019s free!",
          "Good place to visit. The free part of the park is already good enough. The internal part is nice.",
          "Piece of advice, you don't have to pay any fees or do any line if you go early (probably earlier than 8-9am, though times can vary). \n\nIt is beautiful! There is not much to see when you are not in the Dali Area, but go ahead if you want to \u2026",
          "You're like a story in the guell park. Absolutely wonderful scenery, the architecture of gingerbread cottages",
          "I was actually quite dissapointed by everything, had higher expectations. Gaud\u00ed architecture is still amazing and was nice to visit. You have two options when you get there, to visit the free part of the park or pay to see the main \u2026",
          "The free public areas of the park are nice, and there are great views. Also a lot of street musicians that add to the atmosphere. You have to pay (10\u20ac on November 19) to enter the closed area. I don't feel it's worth it. Part of the area is \u2026",
          "Nice big park. The story behind the place is awesome. Good for a walk with family or friends. Also visiting the payed area is worth the effort. We had a guided tour booked which was quite nice and full of interesting background and information about the place",
          "Most beautiful place. Awesome history. Beautiful views.",
          "A great park with amazing views of the city from the top of the hill. But the center of the park, the Gaudi section is what makes it famous. The entry to this part is pretty expensive and during our visit was in restauration. Therefore we skipped the entry.",
          "The Gaudi part of the garden is smaller than envisaged, made smaller still by the restoration work that was happening at the time we visited. I suppose visiting at lunchtime didn't help as the crowds were large. \nWe didn't go into the main \u2026",
          "One of the best attractions in Barcelona. The park alone is worth visiting, the views over Barcelona area are stunning and you should also visit Gaud\u00ec's house, as well as the museum/gallery. A must-go if you're visiting Barcelona.",
          "10 Euros to access into a park... Don't waste your money, the rest of the park is beautiful!",
          "Lots of stairs. Bring water. However, just amazing and beautiful! Still wonder what the triangles are for. I asked around, but never got an answer. My thought was they were hiding places. Maybe someone reading this will know. Thank you",
          "Love this place. We took a stroll in the free section only. When we started in the morning there wasn't that many people. By the time we left which was after three hours, it was crowded. Especially love the many many green parrots.",
          "Great view of the city. Amazing architecture. \nSome helpful tips: wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking quite a bit, check what parts of the park are closed before you go to make sure you don\u2019t miss anything, and buy your tickets \u2026",
          "The park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site under \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\".Park G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which \u2026",
          "Nice place.. You can take amazing pictures",
          "Beautiful architecture, bringing nature and art together with Guadi style and thinking. This stunning walking park has the tiles of the era and tree stump looking architecture holding up the walkways.\nAlong with some manicured gardens and sitting areas. Didn't eat at the local coffee shop, so cannot comment sorry.",
          "Very green & very original park on top of a hill in Barcelona. There's a lot too see here, but the most attractive Monument part forms only the fracture of its territory (about 5-10%). This little part includes for example well known mosaic \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful and spectacular\n Get the tickets for the restricted area. Breath taking.",
          "This is the most amazing park I have ever been in! I felt like I was in a fairy tail! Gaudi really is genius. I don't know what is more beautiful, the view, mosaics, sculptures or columns. I definitely fell in love!",
          "Cost \u20ac10 to go into the restricted zone and most of everything under renovation. Was aware that some parts under renovation bit looks like more than half under renovation!!! Big disappointment. Would have thought they should remove the charge until renovation completed. Better check to ensure renovation completed before going.",
          "Lovely peaceful park overlooking Barcelona. The architectural aspects are beautiful as are the views over the city.",
          "A must to visit in Barcelona. Take your time to walk and enjoy. Beautiful spots to relax and take pictures.",
          "Too much hype for the wrong reasons. There is a paid part of the park and a free to entry part. Personally I liked the free part more. It is a nice park to visit on a sunny day, have a walk through the trees , angel the fresh flowers, hear \u2026",
          "Park Guell embodies so much history and gorgeous architecture. It is no wonder why it is an iconic landmark in Barcelona",
          "It\u2019s a park with some funky buildings, great views of Barcelona but can\u2019t help thinking it\u2019s a bit overrated as an attraction.",
          "Okay park, with stuff for kids to play on. Decent views of the city. Costs to see Gaudi stuff, but seems like you can see most of it from the street.",
          "Magic place, everything it's so mesmerizing.  There are quite a lot of people though. I suggest to visit the park in the early morning, would be less people.",
          "Astonished is the right term to define the feeling when you visit Park Guell. It\u2019s a must when you are in Barcelona. If you visit twice it\u2019s amazing as well as your first visit.",
          "Magnificent but i give 3 stars cause nothing in the whole park is written in English (not even Spanish!)...",
          "This is one of the tourist places where you would see disciplined staff and well versed crowd. I have given 4 stars because of the food quality. It\u2019s slightly over priced which is understandable, however quality and taste isn\u2019t great. \u2026",
          "Beautiful spot, especially first thing in the morning with the sun just coming up. If you go first thing, you can see the park before the crowds get there, and actually get a chance to see the place.",
          "Tremendous display of Spanish art and architecture from early 1900s. If you fancy a trek with good burnout, this is the place to go.",
          "A must see when in Barcelona. Amalgamation of nature and architecture. Great views of the city from the top. Dress comfortably be prepared to walk and climb stairs. Bring a picnic and water. Limited bathroom and baby changing location. Restroom not clean, long lines.",
          "Majestic as I remembered it from my visit almost 20 yrs ago, and subsequent ones after, now almost 10 yrs. Barcelona es Guadi! ;-)",
          "I loved this park. It crowded with tourist who all want a look at one of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s wonders. It is definitely worth the visit and hike up the hills.",
          "I admire the work of Antoni gaudi.  Like no other park I've ever seen, so original and memorable.  Got a 4 due to a lot of construction at the time of visit",
          "Beautifully planned park with great views of the city. Make sure you enter from the Gaudi house museum side. Otherwise, it\u2019s a steep walk upwards that\u2019s quite strenuous. You need to get tickets to this side of the park though, and it sells out quickly.",
          "I went here at night due my hectic schedule but this place was not disappointed me. You can see a wonderful night landscape of Barcelona from this place. It's near the entrance. You can take bus from specific stations to go here to save \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit on a sunny day. Great views of Barcelona and the coast makes for excellent photos. Can be busy so better to go earlier.",
          "Amazing architecture. What an outstanding place. Really worth visiting. Doesn't cost much. Staff friendly and there's a cafe that you can enjoy food and drink from.",
          "Interesting place to visit. Very busy, paid part of the park is quite small and is totally filled with tourists. It\u2019s advisable to check busy hours and try to avoid crowds.",
          "I\u2019ve been to Park G\u00fcell 4 times now and 4 times I have elected not to enter the actual paid portion of the Park. The lines are always extremely long and personally I think you can see just as much beauty by walking around the perimeter of \u2026",
          "No fee to enter the park areas. Easy for walking around. If you climb all the way, you are rewarded with stunning views of the city.",
          "it is amazing.You feel just like you are walking in a fantacy dream.\nYou have never seen an architecture like this before.\nRemember to book or buy your ticket 2 or 3 days befor.Because it is too crowded and you can not see inside .you can just see the garden.",
          "Great spot to see the entire city from, pretty hike.",
          "Good place. You have to buy the tickets in advance  if you wanna go to the restricted areas and to take the bus after the visit.",
          "Good place for pictures but not worth the ticket price. There was scaffolding everywhere, so couldn't even get good pictures.",
          "It is very nice at sunset,but ticket is 10euros after 7pm is free but it was dark ,and half of the park is free to see with no cost from 8.00am to 8.00pm.",
          "Nice park, a good part of it is under renovation work. Small restaurant with drinks and food on site. Very clean and well maintained.",
          "Nice place! Take some food to have a quick snack during your visit. You\u2019ll need it if you plan to walk down the streets to beach))",
          "An amazing park, filled will some very interesting sights that are less structures and more works of art. Don't forget to buy tickets before coming to tge park though - admission to the park is strictly controlled.",
          "The architectural vision of Antoni Gaudi is wonderfully shown in Park G\u00fcell. One can understand how much nature influenced his line of design. It seems like you are transported in a fairytale land. A truly magical place. Strongly recommend to visit it.",
          "one of the best things to do in barcelona. most of the park is free to visit. highly recommended",
          "Park Guell is really neat. Especially when the weather is that great. At the moment there are some constructions. It is really crowded.",
          "A bit crowded in the best area for photos, but beautiful nonetheless. Great for photos.\n\nI'd rate it higher if it weren't for the construction.",
          "Hillside park full of art & leisure, highly recommend! Better go there by a taxi instead of walk if you accompany with kids or elderly members.",
          "Beautiful view; however, it was under construction and therefore made much of the park inaccessible. There is one seating area with a long line for people to take their photo. There were many misleading signs to find the ticket booth, which \u2026",
          "It's a nice park. Not that many things to see. Try to visit this before going inside La Sagrada Familia or it will feel like nothing new",
          "Very nice park separated into section s next to amazing architecture.",
          "Very nice but overpriced! A nice park to visit. Free part of the park I think is good.",
          "Lovely place for sure. But it is currently under construction/repair and most of the really photogenic scenes are covered in scaffolding. They are still charging full price admission during the construction.",
          "We hoped to find a quiet piece of grass to have a chilled afternoon with Friends, or a playground for the children. Unfortunately, none of that was found in the zone free of charge. It's nice to look at, but not a real parc. Very touristic as well...",
          "Very interesting to visit. There's a small caffee, souvenir shop and a model house. Gardens look very pristine.",
          "Very nice place. If you are in Barcelona you should't miss it. I suggest you arrive early to avoid a long queue. You can walk around in a couple of hours.",
          "So the famous Park Guell. Nice but a bit under whelming!",
          "Paid area for visit is small and most in construction. Free if you go before opening time and then worth it.",
          "I went to Park Guell 2009 and the park was accessible all around. I went again 2019 September and Now you can\u2019t see the entire park without paying \u20ac10 to 20. Also there too many random people selling water,cheap jewelry and knock off art \u2026",
          "Great variety of souvenirs all themed around Gaudi. Picked up a few souvenirs for my family here. If you enjoy the Gaudi architecture and bright colors you will probably find something to take home here.",
          "This is one the most iconic sites of Barcelona and defiantly a must see whilst in Barcelona. Althow be aware that the place is usually totally packed with tourists to the top and that it might not be the best idea to visit the place during \u2026",
          "Wonderful!\nBe prepared for (what felt like) a vertical climb up to the monument...\nWorth the few minutes of breathlessness though!\nSave yourself the pain- book online and get there early to avoid the large crowds of tourists that frequent the site.",
          "Wonderful park. Lots of walking and elevation changes. Breathtaking views of the city. The vendors were a bit annoying. The tickets to see the artwork section of the park were sold out by 11am.",
          "Take a sunny with light temperature to visit this Park full of surprises that a guide will unveil for you",
          "Nice park, great to visit with family. We did not purchase tickets and didn't feel the need to as the paid area is also mostly visible from the free zone.",
          "Park G\u00fcell is magical, beautiful and an all-around wonderland of stunning-mosaic-creativity! Get some culture and add some adventure to your life while taking a stroll around Park G\u00fcell. I recommend it to singles, doubles, trios, and so on. \u2026",
          "You can get to Park G\u00fcell by bus, taxi and even walking if you\u2019d like to, I\u2019ll recommend the last if you\u2019re not very far. \nThe place is wonderful, the architecture is really pleasing and the gardens are really nice. Make sure to buy your \u2026",
          "So the majority of the park (nature and many things ) can be seen free which no one knows at first. \nThe price is 10 euro for a small part only which had also a closed area for construction. \n\nThe park is very nice and has great view of \u2026",
          "Too many tourists, nothing special, just some statues that only children will be fond of. visiting experience is awful.",
          "Great place to visit whilst in Barcelona which includes Guadi's house.",
          "I love this place. Its stunning and so relaxing",
          "I have visited the park before and it was lovely, this time there was a lot of construction so we didn\u2019t pay the fee to enter, and strolled around a bit - which was challenging as the signs and instructions how to get where are very lacking, hence the 4 stars. Maybe handing a map of the park will help.",
          "Beautiful park. Great stroll with amazing architecture and views all around.",
          "This park is beautiful. It has a lot of good spots to take pictures and a lot of trails to follow. It's cool because it is located in the middle of the city and acts as a lung for the sorrounding area. It also houses one of the most \u2026",
          "Lot of people but it worth to visit this place. Nice rest from the city - lot of trees, shadows, birds. There is also playground for children and place (table) to eat outside.",
          "Phenomenal. It's not fair to rate a cultural/historic location but I can say that the facilities are well-maintained and organized. #protips reserve your time and buy tickets in advance, if you wait till the day of, they are often sold out. \u2026",
          "Smaller than expected but interesting nonetheless. Do take the free shuttle bus service that comes with the ticket. We didn\u2019t and took the metro instead. Had to walk uphill for a good 20mins before reaching.",
          "We visited 2011 and last year....always the top to enjoy architecture",
          "Such a disappointment. Got there only to find you need paid tickets to walk through a part of it... It was free previously, which if expect as it's a public city park. Tickets were sold out for the day so we just walked around the rest of it, which was nice.",
          "This is more than an ordinary park: lush vegetation, amazingly decorated with a magnificent and breathtaking view of the lower parts of city.",
          "What a fantastic place!!! Beautiful mosaic tiles composed with natural shaped architecture....so nice places. Must visit before die!!",
          "It is likely a must see in Barcelona. I enjoyed the parque, but unfortunately parts of the park are under reconstruction. I would even say that those free entry parts are more beautiful than those for fee.",
          "Great place to have a good view of the city. We did not pay to get entry but you can see plenty from the outside and anyway there is a lot of construction going on blocking a lot of views. Would recommend it for a stroll but don't pay 10\u20ac to get in!",
          "I'm really disappointed because I thought that the entry to the stairwell, with the lizard that is really well-known, was free, well it isn't it's 10\u20ac per adult (from 12 up) and 7\u20ac per senior or child.\nBesides that the free part of the park \u2026",
          "Nice park but it was mostly closed. The area around it which is free was worth the look out for incredible views!!",
          "The view from up there are amazing. I would go earlier thi as it can be quite busy.",
          "Historic Park in Barcelona. Great views of the city as well as beautiful surroundings.",
          "You can see whole Barcelona here. I think there is no need to go inside. The park is really great and enough.",
          "A must see in Barcelona. I recommend the early hours for visiting. Because of the construction taking place in the park it can get crowded and quite loud. The ticket price is not quite fair for the space you see.",
          "Really nice park with good views. Regretted paying for getting access to the restricted part as did not feel like it offered anything specials. The cafe in the restricted part had really good deserts",
          "Beautiful place to wander around. Quite a trek to get to if you are on foot. A good idea to get the bus up the hill. \n\nYou get a fantastic view of the Barcelona cityscape from the park. With all the major landmarks visible.\n\nAlso make sure \u2026",
          "I had a mixed experience... finding the ticket booth was a problem that took a good 45 minutes to solve when we were in the park. Signage needs improvement. Seeing the Gaudi designs and use if tile was interesting.",
          "This park is truly beautiful. I could have spent an entire day here just waking through the park. Of course the Gaudi designed buildings are a must see, but getting into them is difficult because there are so many tourists. I recommend \u2026",
          "Nice and pretty gardens, lively music and street performers! I would say it's not worth it to go into the paid bit as you can see it from the surrounding park!",
          "We went before 8AM to avoid the entrance fee and it was the perfect time to snap some pictures! I don't think I would have given 5 stars if we had to pay though. The area that you have to pay to get access into is really small and is under \u2026",
          "Very nice place. Should spend here no less 4 hours!",
          "Breathtaking views of the Mediterranean. You do have to pay for the Park but there is a large free area as well. It\u2019s hard to tell when you leave the pay area and stroll to the free area. \n\nWe left our stroller because it was difficult \u2026",
          "The Park is beautiful and you have a lot of space for relax and walk in nature .To can visit the house Guell you must pay 10 euro,in my point of view is not worth it.",
          "Quirky, quaint and gorgeous. Yet another facet of the Gaudi ethos. Mosaic and tiling adorn the buildings and walls. Fantastical ironwork gates into the estate and a gift shop in the \"gingerbread\" gatehouse. A Barcelona must-see.",
          "Fun area to walk around and see panoramic views of Barcelona.",
          "Beautiful place very close to nature amazing tourist place",
          "Great place to visit, however you can keep to the free/open section.",
          "Another amazing Goud\u00ed creation! Only like 10\u20ac to enter and no time limit once you're inside. Do it!",
          "Must see in Barcelona. The park is pretty small in itself, but it's totally worth it. Also, please climb at the top of the \"hill\", the view of city is stunning!",
          "Beautiful attraction. Love the detail",
          "It\u2019s a nice park and really good place to visit if you are in Barcelona. Some Paths are dirt and some others are stone or concrete. You get to see a wonderful view of the city without leaving the city. There groups/people playing music for \u2026",
          "Amazing park, Gaudi's work really exceeds one's expectations",
          "For me the most amazing thing to see in Barcelona!!!Great architecture, beautiful nature and not very expensive to entered,great view of Barcelona if u go up!!!!",
          "Noting interesting, surrounding park is much better",
          "I love it mostly because of the view and the nature here, it was great, when you pay the ticket 10\u20ac you have also the bus to go back on the tram station L4. Easy to come and easy to go. One of the best things to see in Barcelona so far.",
          "There is nothing special to see and the root of very dirty around. The free zone is better than paid zone. 10 \u20ac ticket fee is very expensive for what you get",
          "I was being tailed by two men in this park, one of them was trying to open the zip of my backpack, they immediately stopped and walked away when I noticed them. Be careful with your belongings!",
          "The place has a very special feeling. It must to sit down and feel the sunshine.",
          "They are now ticketing for this place!  It was under renovations and blocked off from the public this past September 2019.  When I visited many years ago it was a free attraction and very beautiful.   They sell out daily so we were \u2026",
          "A nice place to visit. Lacks properly maintained walking tracks and finding a parking spot is difficult. Gives good city overview.",
          "Second time here and it does not disappoint! Gaudi's art at its peak here, and the park is well designed to capture its interaction with nature :)",
          "Nice park to stroll around but beware of the tickets. They sell out online and then you can\u2019t see some of the more iconic spots in this park so try to buy in advance - other than that really nice to walk around and soak in some of Gaudi\u2019s designs.",
          "Very nice park with a great view.",
          "Nice park to have some relaxing views and good time with family & friends. Kids will enjoy being here. Recommended for family travelers.\n\nElder people they can't walk through. So plan accordingly.",
          "An obligatory visit to this incredible park is a must; just get there early and book ahead!",
          "Place You have to see when visiting Barcelona and it worth it! No. 2 after Sagrada La Familia cathedral, with some iconic landmarks like entrance buildings and mosaic statues. Amazing design and atmosphere is everywhere in this place. There is also a lot of cute parrots asking visitors for some food gifts (I guess) :)",
          "OK the good news: it\u2019s a fantastic place to visit and it\u2019s stunning.  It also offers views across the city that are unrivalled from anywhere else.\n\nThe bad news: it\u2019s a long way to walk, if like us you\u2019re doing a city break on foot is all \u2026",

          "A fantastic park designed by Gaudi. It is on a top of hill where you can see almost all of Barcelona. Part of it is free, part of it is visited by tickets. You'll enjoy it.",
          "The park is beautiful preferably go on a bright day, the city view is nice. Do not buy tickets from online company tictactickets, but only from the official site, it's cheeper and more reliable. And it's better than standing in line for the box office",
          "\u20ac10 for a ticket, and the park is rather small. That being said, Gaudis work is incredible,  and the location is a must see.\nDon't plan on walking there unless you're staying in Gracia.",
          "Amazing park with alot of beauty and great view of the city.",
          "The park is very well laid out with a path that winds its way to the top four those who wish to take it slow and easy as well as various steeper paths for those in a hurry. We didn't pay to go into the ticketed area for various reasons \u2026",
          "The landscape was great and the monument. \n\nBut there wasn't good flow through out our visit, the guides couldn't help us to find our way. The coffee house staff was slow to service, rude to some people and the equipment they used was dirty and they touch food with bare hands.",
          "Very nice place for a walk and offers high view of a beautiful city",
          "Over priced and not much to see\n\nThe price is far too high for such a disappointing experience. The only things you can see is the stairs too houses (one is the shop and the in the other one there is really nothing to see) and some of the \u2026",
          "Beautiful park!! Still as amazing as the first time I visited,",
          "Awesome attraction. Check opening time to make sure you can get in. Take a walk through the park at night for a different atmosphere.",
          "Nice place but in my opinion 3 stars. I saw nicer places",
          "Inspiring and original art in a beautiful natural setting. We arrived at 9:30 am and stayed until after noon. Glad we went earlier as it got very busy later in the day. Highly recommended!",
          "It is very beautiful park but unfortunately the information and notices are not suitable for a international special tourism attraction. In the park you can not easily understand what is where\ud83d\ude44, so you should collect enough information before going. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffcThe tickets are limited so you should buy them in advance on the internet.",
          "Park G\u00fcell is a big Park with a vast area which you can access free of charge. The main attraction though, which was designed by Gaudi, can't be accessed for free for free from 8:00 to 20:00. If you come before or after that you don't need a ticket ;). Just remember that at 22:00 they close the main gate.",
          "Beautifully crafted estate.\n\nIf you enter before 8am, entry is free and avoids the big crowds. The paid portion of the park is quite small and not really worth the 10 euro entry fee. Going in for free is worth it though.",
          "This is a nice place to stroll. I did not do the paid tour and easily spent two hours here.  There are various structures to see outside the pay zone.  And lovely views. Be aware, that it is actually more of an easy hike than a stroll.  I was not prepared for the hills and steps.  : - )",
          "What a cool place ...\nWandering around where the artist designed houses for people",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Barcelona. Almost everything here is interesting.",
          "I wish we knew that half of the park was closed due reparations. But very beautiful place.",
          "Love Barcelona and loved Park Guell. The park has a part with free access and other that you need to pay if you want to enter, which is worth it, especially if you love Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s work",
          "Didn't go into the paid part of the park but the rest of it is still a lovely day out and worth going.",
          "Come before 8:00 and enter for free. Once you have entered - you can stay as long as you want, but if you leave the terrace you can't come back\nVery nice and quiet place! I do recommend visiting it!",
          "The free part of the park is as good as the payable one.",

          "Nice tourist attraction. Worth seeing, even if you do not have an affinity for strange architecture",
          "Don't waste your money getting tickets! Before 8:30am the park is free. So you purchase the entrance of 8:30am and it's fill with free loading Asian tourist. Most of the park is under renovations anyway. \ud83d\ude1f",

          "Realy Cool.",
          "Free Park area is good enough. Expect winding paths, stair shortcuts, and lots of street vendors selling the exact same items as everyone else. I would not pay the ten Euros to enter the central part of the park. Walking around was good enough for us.",

          "Very nice live music and artists. The landscape was very beautiful  and relaxing to visit.",
          "The park is beautiful and colorful. Don't miss seeing it. We had a guide but you can do it on your own. If you have trouble with steps just take a cane. Very doable.",

          "Nice place to visit. Nice view from the Mirante.",
          "amongst Gaudi's creation, this one is my favorite! I went there in the winter and it was really nice strolling around this park in the afternoon.",
          "Most beautiful park",
          "Highly recommend going during the daytime. The view from the top of the park is beautiful, but it's not lit up. So bring your flashlight.",
          "Good place to visit. Come to enjoy an amazing view.",
          "Very beautiful site with concentrated works from Gaudi and great view! yet, It is not fair to charge people 10\u20ac while half of it is under construction! I understand the value of it, but when it is all in mud and scaffolds all around, there must be a less fee charged I believe!",
          "Awesome parlay the hill top to view the city of Barcelona and it's creator's house as well",
          "Amazing architecture, interesting and unusual designs.",
          "Stunning architecture,  Absolutely beautiful park! A must see in Barcelona!",
          "3/20 Park is under reconstruction. Part of the park is free, part paid. The park is quite big but it works really only for tourists",
          "Beautifully maintained park, very artistic. Also very touristy and busy. It's a must see, but I wouldn't necessarily go back again unless I was a huge fan of Gaudi.",
          "Excellent location for a nice walk and park. If you get off from bus tour note it's a 15 minute walk. \nAll routes to park have a hilly entrance. Public toilets available inside.",
          "Amazing display of architecture and what you can do with a great creative mind.  From the outside you get a glimpse of these beautiful houses.  Once in, your eyes get treated to great forms and sophisticated structures.  Gaud\u00ed was indeed ahead of his time.",
          "12\u20ac the entrance... well there's not a lot to see the free park section had better view to me and things to see. If you want to visit Gaudi's house in the park you have to pay as well...",
          "Nice park, but the part for which you need to pay was under reconstruction",
          "The free part of the park is even more amazing than the paid part. The paid part of the park, although it has iconic views of Gaudi s work, is very busy and has currently some parts under reconstruction, which makes it seem even morw crowded.",
          "Since the park is a very popular attraction ensure your entrance by reserving the tickets beforehand. We arrived 9am and the whole day was already sold out. The park is an interesting combination of different elements, organic shapes and symbolism.",
          "Nice place to visit, excellent view of Barcelona.\nEither if you pay the tickets or not you will enjoy it.",
          "Beautiful park. Good idea to order tickets online if you want to go inside the building as they only have certain time slots open.",
          "Beautiful place with stunning architecture throughout, not to miss.",
          "A few picture op wouldn\u2019t hurt. But seriously expected more, guess it\u2019s a 4-star just cause I love Gaudi. :))",
          "A great way to spend an afternoon or morning without spending any money and also to get a birds eye view of the city. If you\u2019re travelling by public transport, it is quite a distance from the nearest tram station and there are a lot of \u2026",
          "Nice park.  A bit crowded, but beautiful.",
          "The most beautiful place in Barcelona after the Sagrada Familia. You can spend the whole day here and it still wont be enough. \n\nBook tickets online it will save you from queueing in busy summer months. Try to get there early to beat the rush and make the most of the day.",
          "Beautiful park to explore. Lots of walking. Overlooking city of Barcelona.",
          "Nice Park with great views over the city. Too bad it was impossible to get tickets on the spot. Note also that a big part of the paid area is currently closed off for repairs, so maybe wait with paying for the entrance until they finish the work.",
          "Really nice park in Barcelona. Must see if you are in Barcelone. View is incredible and you can walk a long time to discover the park. Get on the top of the park and you will have a great view of Barcelona. I was really impress but the architecture of this park. Really nice and pleasant moment. I definitively recommend it.",
          "A Gaudi\u2019s work of art. Enjoy architecture,  Barcelona views and nature. Lovely place to visit. You can\u2019t loose it.",
          "Park G\u00fcell is one of my favourite places in the whole world. Having a coffee or wine in the right light is a must have in Barcelona and also in your life. I love to read there and to overview the city. Just going for a walk and have a good conversation, listening to music or just let your thoughts travel. Park G\u00fcell will inspire you.",
          "HONESTLY: GET A GUIDE. IT WILL BE WORTH IT. \n1. The hike up is truly a hike. Not impossible but tiring. If you can get a shuttle service or a cab to drop you off at the entrance, better for you. \n2. The tickets are cheaper at the park since \u2026",
          "Birds singing, palms everywhere, calm place and amazing view of Barcelonas skyline",
          "Not so impressive as I thought it will be, few things to see and a part of it was under construction. While I was visiting I kept waiting to see something that it will blow my mind or impress me but it didn't happened sadly.",
          "It is a good place to visit. Very inspiring to know about the architecture.",
          "It's nice but it's too big",
          "Smaller then expected. Part of the park is under conservation when we visited December 2019 but still fun",
          "I am really glad we went. nice walks with lots to see. bit touristy for a park but does not spoil it too much",
          "It's a very nice place with a good view on the city, but has a huuuge amount of tourists.",
          "Over crowded, busy and building work? To be honest it was better when they didn't charge.",
          "Very vast park need more than a day to enjoy it",
          "It was quite the uphill trek to get here but I enjoyed all the Gaudi art throughout this lovely park. Learning about its existence was interesting as well. You can bring food but need to eat it in the picnic area throughout the park.",
          "nice park to walk around, you get a good view of Barcelona when you are on top of the hill",
          "Great views of the city and tons of cool architectural and sculptural details. Great place for photography. Be prepared to wait for the best photo spots, as people tend to cluster.",
          "Great place to see Gaudi's work in action. The monument park is worth getting a ticket for",
          "Must visit... One of the best place to visit in Barcelona, Spain... Work of gaudi is awesome and have mix of ancient and modern architecture",
          "We went there after Carmel Bunkers in the morning, just 15-20 walking distance.  \u20ac10 for the park entry , but you still have to pay additional for some of the selected venues. There is several good instagramy photos spots , architecture to \u2026",
          "Cool place that kinda reminds me of a Neverland but with Graham cracker looking buildings. Unfortunately, construction was happening as of Oct 9, 2019, and it was raining, but please was still cool with the architecture of the pillars and roofs, especially the cave-surf-wave-looking hall walkway.",
          "It's cute but truly overrated. People no need to pay, you can see basically everything from the free area, unless what you want is just a pic for Instagram",
          "Great views but generally a little underwhelmed and be very careful of pick pockets. It\u2019s a nice place to enjoy a walk, get a great view of the sea and see some of the interesting mosaics. I didn\u2019t pay for the park, just accessed the free \u2026",
          "Beautiful park, had a lovely walk",
          "Impressive public space. Schoolhouse still in active use (though out for summer). Nice to see monuments such as this still being used for the purpose which they were originally intended - a space for the community to meet, socialize, and enjoy life.",
          "Beautiful park by Gaud\u00ed but heads up that a lot of the iconic parts of the park (i.e. the undulating bench) are under construction as of Feb 2020 so you can forget about getting your nice panoramic shots.",
          "So lovely to wander in the park land. It's a shame about all the people selling tho. Also \u20ac10 is expensive to see the mosaic seating.",
          "You feel like in a different world when you are there. Amazing place with great views of Barcelona and lot of arts and nature... It was crowdy even in October so I recommend to come earlier.We came about 10 morning, it was all right but after 12.00 started to be very busy.",
          "Beautiful park and a must see in Barcelona.\nThe art and nature is a joy for everybody. \nCan be crowded,but this is Barcelona (so what to do)",
          "Nice time, could be done in about hour. We went at the end of day as during day can really really busy.",
          "Love the free part more than the paying one.",
          "I was unfortunately underwhelmed by the smoggy appearance of the city and the crowded paths filled with hagglers and tourists. The free experience still gets three stars out of me. I\u2019d recommend bringing a snack, finding a cool bench and taking a minute to yourself (away from the crowds).",
          "The whole park is good, but the main attractions are not free. Its treat for Architects and artists.",
          "Nice place to visit , excellent architectural features",
          "A beautiful park with a one-hour walk around. I am balanced if it is worth 10 euros per person and the overcrowded area.",
          "Beautiful park but there are limited tickets available so make sure you buy them on time. Specially Sunday's tickets are sold out quickly.",
          "The view is fantastic and worth the walk, you can get a bus or taxi, but I prefer to walk and feel the city vibe up close.",
          "Park is beautiful and can be walked around without a ticket, but all buildings that you can see with a ticket  are fabulous.",
          "Beautiful and very good place to take photos",
          "Oh guell! U don't wanna miss even if it is a little heavy on the pocket. Book a Say in advance as all slots are fully booked the whole year round",
          "A must see when visiting this city. Relatively easy to locate by the metro but the walk up the hill was the steepest. \n\nThe architecture through the park is mind blowing, the Gaudi museum is pretty cool. The flowers and structures are cool too. The top of the park gives the best view over the city. \n\nBe prepared to walk!",
          "Really busy, be sure to get your tickets prior to your arrival as you may wait minimum of 3 hours if you buy on the spot. \n\nBut still a recommended place to visit in Barcelona.",
          "The park isn\u2019t very big. Be aware that you should wait approximately for two hours after buying tickets to get into the park",
          "Really worth a visit. Need to book online before going. Although the numbers of people are regulated it is busy, lots of people taking photos just where you want to be. Relax, you are probably on holiday and you will get your turn \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Phenomenal views and unique adventures to be had in this beautiful place!",
          "Love walking around here. Great for a picnic and to see some talented musicians who tend to play under the viaducts",
          "Definitely a must visit in Barcelona!\n\nIf I could provide you with any sort of advice, it would be to PLAN AHEAD AND BOOK YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE!\n\nThis is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Barcelona and is another masterpiece \u2026",
          "Honestly there is nothing much to do \nFrom my point of view I reckon it is not worth it to pay \u20ac10 for entry \nThe construction is still working on it and it is quite small tho.",
          "It was a great park but the paths to the building was not available",
          "Very nice park, colorful and unique Guell architecture. Nice visiting",
          "Great park. There are picnic tables if you want to bring in food and just relax with your friends or family.",
          "An absolute must do if you are in Barcelona BUT there's an area that you must purchase entry in advance. So do it if you want to see the beautiful tile work",
          "A beautiful park to wander through. Recommend booking in advance. Entry numbers limited. Great entertainment by buskers.",
          "Everything is closed or under construction at the moment. The museum was ok but probably not worth the entry fee of you're not a Gaudi or history buff.  The rest of the surrounding park is free and just as good.",
          "This is a super interesting place with some fun architecture, you will definitely need to have planed your visit though, as tickets sell out and you must nominate a half hour period you want to attend within. If you fail to enter within \u2026",
          "Both the fee of charge, and the \u20ac10 restricted access places were visited, and both were well worth it. Take a bottle of water, there's lots of climbing! The restricted access site is 100% worth the money.",
          "Nice park but did not pay for the full access.",
          "Such an artistic approach, a must see!",
          "Beautiful architecture. Great for a summer walk. Some of the construction took away from the experience a little bit.",
          "Pretty hard to walk around with small children but very nice buildings and conditions, even a restaurant inside."

        "wiki": "The Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Catalan: [b\u0259\u02c8zilik\u0259 \u00f0\u0259 l\u0259 s\u0259\u02c8\u0263\u027ea\u00f0\u0259 f\u0259\u02c8milj\u0259]; Spanish: Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Familia; ('Basilica of the Holy Family')), also known as the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, is a large unfinished Roman Catholic minor basilica in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Designed by Spanish/Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852\u20131926), his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.On  19 March 1882, construction of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaud\u00ed took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaud\u00ed devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete.Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, revolutionaries set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaud\u00ed's original plans, drawings and plaster models, which led to 16 years of work to piece together the fragments of the master model. Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s. Advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament. It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaud\u00ed's death.The basilica has a long history of splitting opinion among the residents of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with Barcelona's cathedral, over Gaud\u00ed's design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaud\u00ed's death disregarded his design, and the 2007 proposal to build a tunnel of Spain's high-speed rail link to France which could disturb its stability. Describing the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, art critic Rainer Zerbst said \"it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art\", and Paul Goldberger describes it as \"the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages\". The basilica is not the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Barcelona, as that title belongs to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was the inspiration of a bookseller, Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of Asociaci\u00f3n Espiritual de Devotos de San Jos\u00e9 (Spiritual Association of Devotees of St. Joseph).After a visit to the Vatican in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a church inspired by the basilica at Loreto. The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun 19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect Francisco de Paula del Villar, whose plan was for a Gothic revival church of a standard form. The apse crypt was completed before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Antoni Gaud\u00ed assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically. Gaudi began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nOn the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaud\u00ed is said to have remarked: \"My client is not in a hurry.\" When Gaud\u00ed died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete. After Gaud\u00ed's death, work continued under the direction of Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es i Gras until interrupted by the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\nParts of the unfinished basilica and Gaud\u00ed's models and workshop were destroyed during the war by Catalan anarchists. The present design is based on reconstructed versions of the plans that were burned in a fire as well as on modern adaptations. Since 1940, the architects Francesc Quintana, Isidre Puig Boada, Llu\u00eds Bonet i Gari and Francesc Cardoner have carried on the work. The illumination was designed by Carles Bu\u00efgas.\nThe current director and son of Llu\u00eds Bonet, Jordi Bonet i Armengol, has been introducing computers into the design and construction process since the 1980s. Mark Burry of New Zealand serves as Executive Architect and Researcher. Sculptures by J. Busquets, Etsuro Sotoo and the controversial Josep Maria Subirachs decorate the fantastical fa\u00e7ades. Barcelona-born Jordi Fauli took over as chief architect in 2012.The central nave vaulting was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the transept vaults and apse. As of 2006, work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main steeple of Jesus Christ as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory fa\u00e7ade.\nThe church shares its site with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Schools building, a school originally designed by Gaud\u00ed in 1909 for the children of the construction workers. Relocated in 2002 from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, the building now houses an exhibition.\nHistorical photographs of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Construction status ===\n\nChief architect Jordi Fauli announced in October 2015 that construction is 70 percent complete and has entered its final phase of raising six immense steeples. The steeples and most of the church's structure are to be completed by 2026, the centennial of Gaud\u00ed's death; as of a 2017 estimate, decorative elements should be complete by 2030 or 2032. Visitor entrance fees of \u20ac15 to \u20ac20 finance the annual construction budget of \u20ac25 million.Computer-aided design technology has been used to accelerate construction of the building. Current technology allows stone to be shaped off-site by a CNC milling machine, whereas in the 20th century the stone was carved by hand.\n\nIn 2008, some renowned Catalan architects advocated halting construction to respect Gaud\u00ed's original designs, which although they were not exhaustive and were partially destroyed, have been partially reconstructed in recent years.In 2018, the stone type needed for the construction was found in a quarry in Brinscall, near Chorley, England.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\n\n==== AVE tunnel ====\nSince 2013, AVE high-speed trains have passed near the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia through a tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona. The tunnel's construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial. The Ministry of Public Works of Spain (Ministerio de Fomento) claimed the project posed no risk to the church. Sagrada Fam\u00edlia engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building. The Board of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Patronat de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia) and the neighborhood association AVE pel Litoral (AVE by the Coast) had led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success.In October 2010, the tunnel boring machine reached the church underground under the location of the building's principal fa\u00e7ade. Service through the tunnel was inaugurated on 8 January 2013. Track in the tunnel makes use of a system by Edilon Sedra in which the rails are embedded in an elastic material to dampen vibrations. No damage to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia has been reported to date.\n\n\n==== Consecration ====\nThe main nave was covered and an organ installed in mid-2010, allowing the still-unfinished building to be used for religious services. The church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI on 7 November 2010 in front of a congregation of 6,500 people. A further 50,000 people followed the consecration Mass from outside the basilica, where more than 100 bishops and 300 priests were on hand to offer Holy Communion.Starting on 9 July 2017, there is an international mass celebrated at the basilica on every Sunday and holy day of obligation, at 9 a.m, open to the public (until the church is full). Occasionally, Mass is celebrated at other times, where attendance requires an invitation. When masses are scheduled, instructions to obtain an invitation are posted on the basilica's website. In addition, visitors may pray in the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament and Penitence.\n\n\n==== Fire ====\nOn 19 April 2011, an arsonist started a small fire in the sacristy which forced the evacuation of tourists and construction workers. The sacristy was damaged, and the fire took 45 minutes to contain.\n\n\n==== Pandemic ====\nOn 11 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, construction was stopped and the basilica was closed indefinitely. This is the first time the construction has been halted since the Spanish Civil War. The Gaud\u00ed House Museum in Park G\u00fcell was also closed.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe style of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is variously likened to Spanish Late Gothic, Catalan Modernism or Art Nouveau. While the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia falls within the Art Nouveau period, Nikolaus Pevsner points out that, along with Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, Gaud\u00ed carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.\n\n\n=== Plan ===\nWhile never intended to be a cathedral (seat of a bishop), the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was planned from the outset to be a cathedral-sized building. Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as Burgos Cathedral, Le\u00f3n Cathedral and Seville Cathedral. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an ambulatory with a chevet of seven apsidal chapels, a multitude of steeples and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament. Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or cloister which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the narthex of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaud\u00ed's design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.  There are no exact right angles to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.\n\n\n=== Spires ===\nGaud\u00ed's original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the Twelve Apostles, the Virgin Mary, the four Evangelists and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. Eight spires have been built as of 2010, corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity fa\u00e7ade and four apostles at the Passion fa\u00e7ade.\nAccording to the 2005 \"Works Report\" of the project's official website, drawings signed by Gaud\u00ed and recently found in the Municipal Archives, indicate that the spire of the Virgin was in fact intended by Gaud\u00ed to be shorter than those of the evangelists. The spire height will follow Gaud\u00ed's intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation.The Evangelists' spires will be surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull (Saint Luke), a winged man (Saint Matthew), an eagle (Saint John), and a winged lion (Saint Mark). The central spire of Jesus Christ is to be surmounted by a giant cross; its total height (172.5 metres (566 ft)) will be less than that of Montju\u00efc hill in Barcelona, as Gaud\u00ed believed that his creation should not surpass God's. The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the Eucharist. Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church. Gaud\u00ed performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple. However, only one bell is currently in place.The completion of the spires will make Sagrada Fam\u00edlia the tallest church building in the world.\n\n\n=== Fa\u00e7ades ===\n\nThe Church will have three grand fa\u00e7ades: the Nativity fa\u00e7ade to the East, the Passion fa\u00e7ade to the West, and the Glory fa\u00e7ade to the South (yet to be completed). The Nativity Fa\u00e7ade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaud\u00ed influence. The Passion fa\u00e7ade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the steeples, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the Cross. These controversial designs are the work of Josep Maria Subirachs. The Glory fa\u00e7ade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the Seven deadly sins and the Seven heavenly virtues.\n\n\n==== Nativity Fa\u00e7ade ====\n\nConstructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity fa\u00e7ade was the first fa\u00e7ade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaud\u00ed's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the fa\u00e7ade, and are symbolic of change.\nThe fa\u00e7ade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The Tree of Life rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four steeples complete the fa\u00e7ade and are each dedicated to a Saint (Matthias, Barnabas, Jude the Apostle, and Simon the Zealot).\nOriginally, Gaud\u00ed intended for this fa\u00e7ade to be polychromed, for each archivolt to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.Gaud\u00ed chose this fa\u00e7ade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church. He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this fa\u00e7ade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Fa\u00e7ade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it. Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist Etsuro Sotoo.\n\n\n==== Passion Fa\u00e7ade ====\n\nIn contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, the Passion Fa\u00e7ade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the fa\u00e7ade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaud\u00ed for future architects and sculptors. The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by Josep Maria Subirachs, began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the fa\u00e7ade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaud\u00ed intended for this fa\u00e7ade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to \"break\" arcs and \"cut\" columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.\nFacing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Fa\u00e7ade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble Sequoia trunks. Above there is a pyramidal pediment, made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle (James, Thomas, Philip, and Bartholomew) and, like the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.\nThe scenes sculpted into the fa\u00e7ade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an S form and reproduce the stations of the Cross (Via Crucis of Christ). The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the Last Supper, Kiss of Judas, Ecce homo, and the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes The Three Marys, Saint Longinus, Saint Veronica, and a hollow-face illusion of Christ on the Veil of Veronica. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the Resurrection of Christ can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the steeples of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the Ascension of Jesus.The fa\u00e7ade contains a magic square based on the magic square in the 1514 print Melencolia I. The square is rotated and one number in each row and column is reduced by one so the rows and columns add up to 33 instead of the standard 34 for a 4x4 magic square.\n\n\n==== Glory Fa\u00e7ade ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe largest and most striking of the fa\u00e7ades will be the Glory Fa\u00e7ade, on which construction began in 2002. It will be the principal fa\u00e7ade and will offer access to the central nave. Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while Hell is left for those who deviate from God's will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this fa\u00e7ade completed, Gaud\u00ed made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were base for the development of the design for the fa\u00e7ade. The completion of this fa\u00e7ade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca.To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase will lead over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. On other projects Carrer de Mallorca will have to go underground. It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground. The portico will have seven large columns dedicated to gifts of the Holy Spirit. At the base of the columns there will be representations of the Seven Deadly Sins, and at the top, The Seven Virtues.\n\nGifts: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.\nSins: greed, lust, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy.\nVirtues: kindness, diligence, patience, charity, temperance, humility, chastity.\nThis facade will have five doors corresponding to the five naves of the temple, with the central one having a triple entrance, that will give the Glory Fa\u00e7ade a total seven doors representing the sacraments:\n\nBaptism\nConfirmation\nEucharist\nPenance\nHoly orders\nMarriage\nUnction of the sickIn September 2008, the doors of the Glory fa\u00e7ade, by Subirachs, were installed.  Inscribed with the Lord's prayer, these central doors are inscribed with the words \"Give us our daily bread\" in fifty different languages.  The handles of the door are the letters \"A\" and \"G\" that form the initials of Antoni Gaud\u00ed within the phrase \"lead us not into temptation\".\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nInterior of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The central nave vaults reach forty-five metres (148 feet) while the side nave vaults reach thirty metres (98 feet). The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5 metre (25 ft) grid. However, the columns of the apse, resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches sixty metres (200 feet). The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching seventy-five metres (246 feet). Gaud\u00ed intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft.\nThere are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below.\nThe columns of the interior are a unique Gaud\u00ed design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise).\nEssentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.\n\n\n==== Organ ====\nIn 2010 an organ was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.\nTo overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.\n\n\n=== Geometric details ===\n\nThe steeples on the Nativity fa\u00e7ade are crowned with geometrically shaped tops that are reminiscent of Cubism (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of Art Nouveau, but Gaud\u00ed's unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.\nGaud\u00ed used hyperboloid structures in later designs of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (more obviously after 1914). However, there are a few places on the nativity fa\u00e7ade\u2014a design not equated with Gaud\u00ed's ruled-surface design\u2014where the hyperboloid crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican, there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). And finally, the \"bishop's mitre\" spires are capped with hyperboloid structures. In his later designs, ruled surfaces are prominent in the nave's vaults and windows and the surfaces of the Passion fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n\nThemes throughout the decoration include words from the liturgy. The steeples are decorated with words such as \"Hosanna\", \"Excelsis\", and \"Sanctus\"; the great doors of the Passion fa\u00e7ade reproduce excerpts of the Passion of Jesus from the New Testament in various languages, mainly Catalan; and the Glory fa\u00e7ade is to be decorated with the words from the Apostles' Creed, while its main door reproduce the entire Lord's Prayer in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of \"Give us this day our daily bread\" in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Fa\u00e7ade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory fa\u00e7ade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion fa\u00e7ade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse steeple bears Latin text of Hail Mary. All in all, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ.\nAreas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nJosep Maria Bocabella\nAntoni Gaud\u00ed\n\n\n== Appraisal ==\nThe art historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaud\u00ed's buildings as growing \"like sugar loaves and anthills\" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly \"bad taste\" but handled with vitality and \"ruthless audacity\".The building's design itself has been polarizing. Assessments by Gaud\u00ed's fellow architects were generally\npositive; Louis Sullivan greatly admired it, describing Sagrada Fam\u00edlia as the\n\"greatest piece of creative architecture in the last twenty-five years. It is spirit symbolised in stone!\"Walter Gropius also praised the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, describing the building's walls as \"a marvel of technical perfection\".Time Magazine called it \"sensual, spiritual, whimsical, exuberant\", George Orwell called it \"one of the most hideous buildings in the world\", James A. Michener called it \"one of the strangest-looking serious buildings in the world\" and British historian Gerald Brenan stated about\nthe building \"Not even in the European architecture of the period can one discover anything so vulgar or pretentious.\" The building's distinctive silhouette has nevertheless become symbolic of Barcelona itself, drawing an estimated 2.5 million visitors annually.\n\n\n=== World Heritage status ===\nTogether with six other Gaud\u00ed buildings in Barcelona, part of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as testifying \"to Gaud\u00ed's exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology\", \"having represented el Modernisme of Catalonia\" and \"anticipated and influenced many of the forms and techniques that were relevant to the development of modern construction in the 20th century\". The inscription only includes the Crypt and the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\n== Visitor access ==\nVisitors can access the Nave, Crypt, Museum, Shop, and the Passion and Nativity steeples. Entrance to either of the steeples requires a reservation and advance purchase of a ticket. Access is possible only by lift (elevator) and a short walk up the remainder of the steeples to the bridge between the steeples. Descent is via a very narrow spiral staircase of over 300 steps. There is a posted caution for those with medical conditions.As of June 2017, online ticket purchase has been available. As of August 2010, there had been a service whereby visitors could buy an entry code either at Servicaixa ATM kiosks (part of CaixaBank) or online. During the peak season, May to October, reservation delays for entrance of up to a few days are not unusual.\n\n\n== International masses ==\nThe Archdiocese of Barcelona holds an international mass at the Basilica of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia every Sunday and on holy days of obligation.\n\nDate and time: Every Sunday and on holy days of obligation at 9 am\nThere is no charge for attending mass but capacity is limited\nVisitors are asked to dress appropriately and behave respectfully.\n\n\n== Funding and building permit ==\nConstruction on Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is not supported by any government or official church sources. Private patrons funded the initial stages. Money from tickets purchased by tourists is now used to pay for the work, and private donations are accepted through the Friends of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.The construction budget for 2009 was \u20ac18 million.In October 2018, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia trustees agreed to pay \u20ac36 million in payments to the city authorities, to land a building permit after 136 years of construction. Most of the funds would be directed to improve the access between the church and the Barcelona Metro. The permit was issued by the city on 7 June 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of basilicas\nList of Gaud\u00ed buildings\nList of Modernista buildings in Barcelona\nSagrada Fam\u00edlia metro station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Construction Board of La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Foundation\nGaud\u00ed, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (video), Smarthistory",

          "I thought the outside of the cathedral was interesting, but the inside is absolutely fantastic! It's difficult to describe, but it's a must see, especially; n a sunny day when the sun can shine through the stained glass windows",
          "a magical \"must see\" place to visit in Barcelona. Beautiful architecture inside and outside. Definitely recommended",
          "Wow a must see in Barcelona! It\u2019s breathtaking at first sight, the tour is well organised and it doesn\u2019t take too long!",
          "Amazing landmark, wonderful history, and very detailed architecture and carvings. The architectural styles change so much throughout the building depending on the lead architect at the time that section was being built. Was told it should be done in 6 years. Hope to return to",
          "The Sagrada Familia is brilliant to look at outside and even more beautiful on the inside so if you are visiting go inside! I definitely think the prices are a bit steep but we were able to get a cheaper ticket as we were under 30 and also visited later on in the day, I would",
          "There is a lot of talk about this place and it is very busy, but it could not be more impressive. It is a masterpiece of construction and should not be missed when visiting Barcelona.",
          "We took the time to visit the Sagrilia Familia after all the raving about it we heard and boy are they right.... Everything is simply stunning, its extremely busy and be wary of the pickpockets but other than that, spend a moment to just enjoy it. Staff are really helpful and",
          "Worth seeing the Basilica ,Feels like you are inside a forest with very tall trees . Different ambiance compared to the other Basilicas. Gaud\u00ed is amazing .",
          "Thanks for Erik from Donkey tours we go inside Sagrada familia and it was wonderful and absolutely worth it. Everyone should see this place. Thank you again Erik!",
          "If you\u2019ve seen one church, you\u2019re seen them all. CANNOT be applied here. What a breath taking and iconic church. The price of admission was steep but I would still recommend!",
          "Unique on this planet. Challenging human capabilities, this genius was centuries ahead of his time. Nr 1 to visit",
          "It is a magical place to go. We saw it a few years ago when there was still inside construction. When visiting in October 2019 it was amazing to see it all done on the inside.",
          "Latest visit to see how the work is progressing on this wonderful piece of architecture. Stunning as usual. Not to be missed.",
          "We've seen this many times from the outside, but the read about the stained glass windowns and went 2 hours before sunset. The whole experience was unbelievable. You have to book in advance as the limit the people around time slots. Once your are inside, you can stay as long as",
          "The line was not that long compared to what I had read online (maybe because of bad weather) and we were inside within 30 minutes. I would absolutely recommend buying tickets online beforehand. I had opted for an audio guide and I will say it was worth the price charged. We",
          "I don't practice any religion, but the feeling and beauty of this building inside actually brought me to tears.",
          "Got to be seen to be believed, especially inside. So different !! Even in February it was busy, so worth buying the skip the line tickets. Security takes a while to get though.",
          "I was completely overawed with this Cathedral. I would recommend everyone visit and listen to the story behind Gaud\u00eds creation. There is still building work being undertaken around the cathedral but it does not spoil the visit. I really look forward to another visit as there is",
          "We were told to visit the Basilica and spent over $60 for tickets. It was so confusing as to where to go and what to do we almost left. We got tickets that allowed us to not stand in line but there were no signs and only lines..no one or no signs to direct. The building is",
          "Rip off!! The website crashes so they charge you extra to pay at the entrance They know the website crashes and yet they do nothing to help!!",
          "Since our first visit in 2004 and my parents talking about this place it\u2019s always on our to do list. Absolutely stunning. The interior is just bathed with sunlight throughout. A real must do visit but remember to book tickets in advance. You cannot get tickets on the day. Highly",
          "Sagrada Familia is very much worth a visit. It is amazing how high it is. The stain glass windows are amazing. You can get an audio guide which explains the building as you go around. I would recommend booking on line as we did then you don't have to wait in a long queue.",
          "This must be like all the big UK cathedrals were in the middle ages. Mostly complete but lots of building work going on and still years away from being finished. Fascinating history and details in the building.",
          "There is no description which could do the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia justice, simply stunning. I really want to return when it\u2019s finished. The audio tour is great and it was in total an unforgettable experience. Don\u2019t even think about visiting Barcelona without spending a few hours here...",
          "Was the most amazing experience I and my friends had would come again was lovey day going there .would recommend it to people",
          "It is the most incredible church in terms of architecture I've ever seen. From the outside looking up, the building seems to be from another planet. It is so intricate, so detailed and fascinating! I cannot even grasp the mind of its creator. It is the mind of a genius. The",
          "You can't really describe what it's like to enter the first time. It's breathtaking with all the light coming through all the different colored windows. We went up the nativity tower. Great view, but not the most fun to walk down. If you have a fear of heights or can't do stairs",
          "The Sagrada Familia, designed by Antoni Gaudi in 1882, is not only a sight or a church in Barcelona, itis probably one of the most fascinating buildings in the world. The construction is still unfinished. It is built step by step with donations. Everywhere in the church there",
          "It has to be said that this is definitely worthy of a visit. I don't think anyone should visit Barcelona and not take a look at this but I was left a bit disappointed in what you got for your money. It is as lovely from the outside (free) as it is on the inside so if you cannot",
          "This is such a beautiful place. Even for as a non-believer, I am in awe of such an inspiring structure, and had a wonderful time strolling through watching the light dance around the floor and walls. Definitely one of the highlights of this place. An absolute treasure worth",
          "Thought it was a bit pricey when we booked our tickets online, but after our visit I believe it is worth the money and even more. It is absolutely impressive & unique, a must see when visiting Barcelona.",
          "A must see while in Barcelona. The architecture and Gothic style church is an amazing site to see. We didn't get to go inside but just walking around was cool enough. Plenty of cool restaurants and cafes near by to visit also.",
          "We made the mistake of seeing SF as our first stop in BCN. We were so blown away, that nothing else in the city could match the amazing experience.",
          "Great tour at Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. It is worth paying a little more to get a tour with one of the guides at Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. There are so many details in that are only pointed out in a tour that you would not understand with out one. A must see and experience while visiting",
          "Book well in advance or you won\u2019t get in and it\u2019s timed visits. Huge but the inside is really modern with stained glass and pillars supporting the roof which radiate out like upside down tree roots. History of Cathedral in basement and you are able to go up one of the towers if",
          "It's a must-see during a visit to BCN - and it's totally nuts! Ridiculous but fascinating architecture. Maybe they will finish it one of these days !",
          "I have visited Barcelona many times but never been in the sagrada familia, only seen it from the outside, and it didn't disappoint. I can't wait to see it again in 2026 when its finished!",
          "If you ever visit Barcelona, The Sagrada Familia is a must-see. It is better to buy your tickets online, to skip the long lines. And always ask a person of the staff where to enter, otherwise you may stay twice. Use the audio guide because it will give you important information",
          "On a previous tour we got a tip to do this in the afternoon - the nativity side --- as the sun would be behind us and a better view! Right on --- it was not that crowded in February --- we did a 3:30 time, a 4 pm climb...and it was perfect. I wish I had gone through the museum",
          "Visited with my wife. We both loved the architecture and scale. I was impressed with the scale of engineering especially given it was started over a 100 years ago. We booked the audio tour. For some strange reason, just general admission had sold out... The cynic in me says",
          "Seeing this amazing building is a sight to behold. Its absolutely stunning. We opted for the audio tour. It cost 25 euros per person & was worth it. Although there is just a basic entrance fee of 20 euros pp which would have been fine too. Gaudi's work is a masterpiece. The",
          "Beautiful building inside and out. Make sure you book time slot, you still have to wait in line, but worth the wait. Beautiful stained glass windows in the newer section. Not suitable for small children.",
          "Amazing beautiful and a must see. Went into one tour and it was amazing. Wish we could\u2019ve gone into both but the nativity one sold out a whole day ahead. So book quick. We walked there was a nice walk.",
          "I last visited the Cathedral 30 years ago when much of it was open to the elements. What a incredible transformation but still so much to do and they are apparently planning on it being finished by 2026 in time for the 100th anniversary of Gaudis death. They have 10 more towers",
          "The Basilica will be so much better in 2026 when finished, but you have to go now. If possible go when it is sunny to get the best inside view of the glass windows and textures. The outside is still a building site. Give it time",
          "This basilica cannot be described with words. Book tickets in advance and get the audio guide. We booked about 1.5 hours before sunset and the light from the stained glass was surreal.",
          "Is a nice place to visit when you visit Barcelona. I really had a good time there. Easy to get there with tram and metro bus.",
          "This building is awe inspiring. But very bazaar. All the details are on the outside, plain detailing on the inside. But stunning at the same time. A must visit. We took the audio tour which was very confusing. The instructions are not clear but the information is good and",
          "All went well with are visit. Pleased we pre booked with audio. Time was also good before it got busy 10.30. Definitely go at least half an hour before your time booked. The que was long.",
          "As it is such a famous Basilica, and often shown in television, I thought I would not be caught in awe. Upon entering the La Sagrada Familia, however, I was truly stunned by its magnificence. The vivid reflection of the stained glasses and the trunk-shaped columns are unique.",
          "Definitely pay for a tour to learn all the details about the church and it\u2019s beautiful architecture, Gaud\u00ed and the other architects who created it and what\u2019s next for the project.",
          "Better on the inside than on the outside. Which is high praise indeed and why you should pay the ticket and take the tour",
          "We absolutely loved the 1,5 hr guided tour at the Sagrada Familia. We found out a lot about Gaudi and his ideas for this Basilica. The light effects of the stainglass windows are fantastic. We will be back once finished in 2026.",
          "We chose the audio guided tour with the nativity towers. Book in advance to guarantee your time and avoid queues. Beautiful inside and out and still not finished. Excellent views from the towers. You are not allowed to bring backpacks up to the towers and there are lockers",
          "Set up a guided tour for 10AM and while it was busy all around w other tourists, the group made our way through. The headsets kept the family focused on the tour and not the other distractions of groups or construction. Of all the churches in Europe, this is by far the most",
          "I have seen many churches around the world but this one is totally mind blowing. Its a totally different kind of construction and shows the genius of Gaudi. Make sure you book your ticket in advance.",
          "If you do nothing else in Barcelona make sure you visit this absolutely stunning building. It had been on my bucket list for a long time and did not disappoint. We paid for a skip the line with audio guide ( around \u00a330) and it was worth every penny. The outside is amazing but",
          "Magical place. The most wonderful and beautiful Cristian Building that I've ever seen/been. Peridod.",
          "If you don't do anything else in Barcelona, make sure you do this. We paid approx \u20ac25 per person with an audio headset, this entry fee is worth every penny. Up close, the architecture of this cathedral is stunning and to be honest when looking at the minute detail you can see",
          "Well every time we go to Barcelona we look up from the outside and think what a fantastic building this time we went inside and it\u2019s worth the visit book on line and agree a time but remember the security inside is strict enjoy",
          "Only saw this place from the outside. Best looking Catholic Church I have seen. 38 euro to go in. Definitely need to see this place.",
          "Very beautiful work of art created by a man, it is breathetaking and everything is so thought to the detail.",
          "If you want to see this place, book a tour ahead of time with tower access. The best time is the late afternoon so you can see the suns ray light up the stained glass.",
          "Highly recommend seeing this. It's such an amazing structure and we were in awe when we saw it. The audio guide is great and helpful too.",
          "This building was insanely gorgeous! A must-see in Barcelona! It will probably look very crowded but it is worth it\u2026 The audio tour was incredibly informative. The day we went they had an elevator malfunction, so we couldn\u2019t go to the tower but I would recommend it if it is",
          "An essential visit on any trip to Barcelona. It must rank among the wonders of the modern world. Once you get through airport standard security the temple is awe inspiring. The audio guide is essential to make the most of your visit. While the architecture is marvellous and the",
          "A must see when you go to Barcelona, take time to visit in the middle of the day, when the colors inside the church are at their peak. Early morning lends to blues, or the beginning, late afternoon lends to reds, or passion. I wish I had known to go on a sunny day. One thing",
          "I live in a semi-rural area of America and I am unaccustomed to long lines or large crowds. I also tend to be a bit spontaneous with respect to my travel activities, therefore, buying tickets in advance for venues is not my thing. I thought that a Monday morning in early",
          "Amazing building and unless your really into architecture or Catholicism the basic tour is enough to understand the project and its grandeur. We went on the later tour so we saw the cathedral at sunset on the way in and then all lit up at night on the way out. A must see in",
          "Wow! All your senses become captivated by the work of Gaudi! Unbelievable! Please go, you won\u2019t regret it!",
          "The best thing to guarantee a visit is to buy your ticket from the cathedral website in advance. (When we arrived all tickets had sold out so we were glad we did this). I am not usually overly impressed by religious buildings but this stunned me!",
          "I took this tour last week. The amount of detail our guide went into was extraordinary. We appreciated her patience with a large group. A little suggestion if you do go up in the towers. When they tell you \"don't go up if you have a fear of heights or claustrophobia\". Believe",
          "Wow. Loved it. Its best to purchase the ticket in advance especially if you're visiting on a Sunday. I went first thing in the morning. There is a strict dress code (i.e. no shorts, tank tops, etc.). The place itself is stunning. So much history and appreciation of it. There is",
          "May not have been there when it started, but the end result is terrific and worth the effort to see it.Book tickets to beast the queues.",
          "Beautiful. Pictures do not do it any justice at all. We had a tour and found it informative and interesting. Highly recommend the museum and going up the tower.",
          "We went to Barcelona for a weekend break and walked up from the Glories to Sagrada Familia and when it came into view it stopped me dead...wow what a sight...pictures and videos will not do this justice, you absolutely have to be there...stunning building which looks like it has",
          "You must go at sunset and buy pre-booked tickets to avoid the queues. The stained glass windows are just amazing!!! The late sun fills the basilica with glorious light. It is so different to other churches and cathedrals inside, so modern. The shapes and colours, the twisted",
          "This was so much more than I read about or that you see in photos. Art and church aficionados really shouldn\u2019t miss this. This is a living, breathing workshop for artists that are still finishing the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, scheduled for 2026. Gaudi understood that he was delivering",
          "The church has such an interesting history, dramatical architecture and different take on a holy building which embraces different religious beliefs. It\u2019s worth 5 stars, but the many visitors and the fact that you have to book in advance results in \u2018only\u2019 4 stars. Please",
          "Amazing place. Spent far longer than we expected to there. Wonderful project. Last saw it 16 years ago and the progress is slow but impressive.",
          "an amazing master piece . one of the most beautiful sites i saw in Spain . as well as gaudi gardens , true genius. don't miss it.",
          "Absolutely amazing. Breadth taking. Incredible architecture. A must visit when in Barcelona. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "Gaudi\u2019s masterpiece - a must see. Top tips: book tickets in advance on line to beat queues. The towers are good to go up, but even with a booked ticket you will have to queue for 30 minutes, which is a shame. Audio guide definitely recommended, even if it\u2019s a little patronising!",
          "Advance tickets are a must! Our tour leader walked us top the gate and met us at the end, so many pictures! The light thru the windows is amazing! We were there at 4:30 so had the afternoon sun on the red/yellow windows. We found the audioguide a little confusing at the",
          "Beautiful church. Those Catholics sure know how to build a church. Warning. There is airport style scanners, so be warned. They're a faff in itself! The speaking tour is wonderful. I genuinely could have spent longer there, Amand we spent 3 hours!",
          "I have read and seen pictures of this place all of my life. None could describe the magnificence of what Gaud\u00ed created and others are finishing. Must see.",
          "The place to visit and not to be missed. Views from outside of this church itself are amazing !!! It's huge from all sides ..the architecture with the size coupled with many detailed work is really to be viewed and applauded..",
          "Amazingly beautiful, but very crowded. Go early. We paid to go up to the Natividad tower. The view from the top was breathtaking. Please note that you can elevator up but need to be able to walk down a very narrow spiral staircase (over 400 steps) to get down. If you are",
          "We booked online in advance to avoid any queues. Not sure that helped or not, but it likely saved a little time if nothing else. Security to get in is much like an airport experience. However it is quick and you\u2019re led to the front of the Basilica were you can collect an audio",
          "This is hands down the most mesmerizing church you\u2019ll ever encounter. Once you walk up to it, you\u2019ll realize why Barcelona is so obsessed with the architect, Gaudi. This building is a masterpiece from every angle and you won\u2019t be able to get enough of it. Lines are long and",
          "An amazing cathedral. Truly spectacular. We did the tower access as well. I am terrified of heights but did ok because it is very enclosed. If you are claustrophobic the stairway down is very tiny (400+ stairs) and I can see how some people may not do ok with it.",
          "Can't miss it, the sculptures on the outside are amazing! We did the hop on hop off bus so got a lot of info about the church but our guide Frederico (on another trip) also supplied us with lots of info. The inside is also grand. Definitely worth a visit. We were lucky and",
          "It is without a doubt the most unique and spectacular cathedral i have ever experienced. Antoni Goudi was a master of his craft.",
          "But eventually churches start to look the same. Yes this one was designed by Gaudi and its style is distinctive but not that different. Also we got the audio guide but they didn\u2019t tell us we should follow the exhibit numbers for the express tour.",
          "You can take pictures outside SF, but crowded. There is a small concrete square block about 2'\u00d72' and about 2' off of the ground on the opposite side of the street of the entrance where you can actually get a decent photo of yourself by standing on the block without cutting off",
          "Gaud\u00ed was clearly a genius and the Basilica is a fantastic piece of architecture however I don't feel it was worth the money to go inside. We bought tickets from the kiosk across from the Basilica where we got 2 tickets for skip the line with audio tour-\u20ac56 for 2... But we",
          "at the church we put all belongings through the security machine and the police man an old police man stopped us with a serious face looking at us with his scary eyes which make me and my husband scared and nervous he pointed at us and make us look so bad like we did a very bad",
          "Very knowledgeable, funny and devout guide, Raul from Headout.com booking. The cathedral is amazing. Hope to come back in 2026 when it is finished.",
          "This certainly is one of the most unusual, yet stunning churches in the world. Every corner has a new discovery in it. What an imagination to creat such a work of art.",
          "Hard to describe the immensity of this amazing building. Has to be seen Well organised. Queue to get in moved very quickly. Once in you can take your time.",
          "We visited slightly out of peak tourist season and it was breathtaking we booked our tickets for late afternoon but apart from the tower climb there was no time limit for staying inside the bas\u00edlica so we ended up staying until it closed. I would definitely recommend booking",
          "Pay the 20 Euros or so to gain inside access. It's incredible and heavenly. There are small signs inside that explain the significance of various aspects of the Basilica. You have to go through security to get into the Basilica and you cannot eat inside. You are allowed to take",
          "This is a must. It is so very different and incredible. The Nativity tower is well worth a visit not only to see the views, the sculptures up close but also the views into the interior as you walk down.",
          "Amazing breath taking unbelievable must see . Came here on a trip and knew I would have to see this .. so glad I did the views are just incredible and the whole atmosphere around it is very special . I would recommend to add this to your visit to Barcelona without any doubt .",
          "i last went there 4/5yrs ago and i thought that what they were doing to his ideas was very tacky but when i revisited how wrong i was .i just hope that i will be able to revisit in 2026 when it should be finnished",
          "Impressive architecture and a must see in Barcelona. But seriously 26 EUR to enter, that is pure rippoff.",
          "A must see when visiting Barcelona, quite amazing place. Gets very busy so go early if you don\u2019t want to queue.",
          "This was one of the \u2018top of the list\u2019 things we wanted to see in Barcelona. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get the chance to go in, but it is such a sight to behold and the detail on the architecture is outstanding! We popped in the shop and there\u2019s an array of Sagrada Familia and",
          "Well organized tour to enjoy all the visit area. Only disturb for outside pictures the never end external structure. You can enjoy and better understand the fusion between architecture and nature into Gaudi s mind. Surrounded by plenty of restaurant options.",
          "Fantastic! And it is not finished yet! The basilica is full of wonders, secret meanings, ideas. Everything there is made to impress your eyes, your ears, and every other sense , and generally - your soul! I recommend reading a book before you go so that you do not miss",
          "Take the guided tour. It was only \u20ac1 more than audio guide and I\u2019m certain we got far more out of it. I\u2019ve been to a lot of churches and aside from the Vatican I found this to be the most beautiful. The stained glass color is breathtaking. Purchase tickets online, they are",
          "The Sagrada Familia is an experience not to be missed! Beautiful. Amazing. There is no equal to this masterpiece. Beautiful! And the tower excursion is a close up and personal experience! Do it!",
          "Take the guided tour this is my advise. This was my 3rd visit to the cathedral. Each one it looked different and now amaxing.",
          "This was the most beautiful church i ahve seen. It is amazing how this could have been built without power tools or equipment.",
          "We reserved tickets for the tour with a guide - well worth it! Our guide was both informative and entertaining. I don't think it would have been the same with just a recorded audio guide. The architecture and stories about this place are amazing. One of the top sights I've seen",
          "10 euros to enter a beautiful and spectacular experience. I didn't want to leave, I kept looking back. There are a lot of tourists, so be careful of your belongings and long ques. Will be finished in 2026! In 2020, I loved every moment of it.",
          "Spectacular architecture. A work of art. Go early to avoid the crowds. Get your ticket online beforehand or you may not get in.",
          "Fantastically ornate and interesting. The huge stained glass windows inside are stunning, especially as the sun was shining through when we visited.",
          "The only thing there is to say is that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen any man made thing more beautiful than this.",
          "One of the most amazing churches I have ever seen both inside and out. I cannot wait to see it finished, that would be great. Unfortunately, we did not go up to the towers, maybe next time",
          "I was in awe of this magnificent structure inside and out. Such intricate detailing throughout, you could spend hours looking and chatting with the amount of tourists entering throughout the day. If you are in Barcelona, don\u2019t miss this spectacular vision.",
          "This is an amazing structure inside and out. Time your visit so that you see the light streaming through the stained glass windows - it's incredible. Book in advance, get there on time and try to ignore the crowds. Photos of the exterior are better taken first thing in the",
          "Is the most beautiful and amazing cathedral I have ever seen. Speachless! We book the tickets online with audioguide and Nativity Tower visit. Amazing! The work of Gaudi is impresive. You can't describe with words all the emotions and feelings you have during visiting Sagrada",
          "This is the most beautiful and unique cathedral I have seen in my entire life. Gaudi managed to bring the beauty of the outdoors into the cathedral. It is worth booking in advance and allowing plenty of time to absorb the beauty of this incredible cathedral.",
          "One of my favorite places on earth! Every part of the building is beautiful, from the detailed sculpted exterior to the spectacular stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings inside. A must see for any Barcelona visitor!",
          "In my opinion, the greatest architectural work of Gaudi, still under construction. Greatness, design, materials and integration with the environment are part the Basilica and deserve to be enjoyed in detail.",
          "Be ready to spend the day looking at the great works of history. Know that by the end of the day your neck will be tired and a glass of wine will hit the spot.",
          "Alberto - Very professional and well spoken guide from Sagrada Familia, learnt a lot from him . Way better than a audio guide . Take this tour and not those of tour groups , lot of time to spend in the church",
          "What an amazing place to behold! So much detail, incorporating spiritual elements with nature. So much rich color and the history to take in. This is a don't miss place to visit!",
          "Great place to visit. Beautiful interior and exterior too. I'd advise booking online as it is cheaper and you can select a time to visit. We used the audio service and found that really useful. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Amazing structure and was very much surprised with the beauty inside the church. Worth the visit! Best to buy tickets online and choose you time slot. We booked the ones after 4 pm since it was cheaper and was lucky since the crowd is smaller. Just make sure to come on time and",
          "Amazing, breathtaking and awe inspiring. The beautyof it made me cry. The vision of Guildi left me wanting to know more about this man.",
          "Amazing design and details one of the big bas\u00edlica in Europe. It been in building process for the last 150 years. Must see while in Barcelona.",
          "It is a must to see if you visit Barcelona and here you can see the genius of the architect. Amazing from the entrance till the end . Enjoy your time and after that visit Guell Park !!!!",
          "Awe inspiring. Unique. A true work of art. The tower access is 100% worth it. Stunning views of Barcelona and the outside sculptures of the church. Stairway down the tower is absolutely terrifying! Magnificent experience of Gaud\u00ed brilliance.",
          "Photo only good for front view and a bit side angle, not the real side or from the lake . If visit evening u can see fantastic glass art. Make sure pretty time to walk around before purchase the tickets.",
          "Walking into the basilica ... even with the amount of people inside ... it struck me how spiritual a place this was. It's hard to know where to look first. Yes, I had an audio guide which I followed for the most part but at times it just makes sense to shut that off and take",
          "No visit to Barcelona is complete without a visit here and it certainly didn't disappoint. From the moment you first get sight of Sagrada Familia even from a distance it is captivating and draws you on from every direction. Upon entering, and going through the airport style",
          "Despite the long queue and the sea of tourists, be awed by an incredible space! We went up the Nativity Tower, I feel this is not necessary to enjoy the splendour of the architecture.",
          "If you visit Barcelona you must visit here I would say go at sunset as the stained glass windows give off an amazing glow.",
          "Gaudi's landmark that defines Barcelona. Not to be missed even if the entry price makes your eyes water.",
          "We arrived at the Sagrada from Park Guell and it appears out of the blue and is breathtaking. The pre bought tickets were a must as the slots filled up quickly even out of season. We didn\u2019t get the audio guide and certainly felt that the information presented would have been",
          "a beautiful unusual structure and worth visiting. the ticketing system is a pain - book in advance - trying to organise outside amongst the crowds is a nightmare.",
          "So beautiful. The Sagrada Familia is the most beautiful things to see from Gaudi. The architecture of the church is just masive and yet so elegant. If you find yourself in Bercelona, I highly reccomend you atleast visit the inside atleast once to see the masterpiece of Gaudi.",
          "What a amazing architecture it is ! You can find all stories of the Bible. If you want to appreciate deeper, you should read the Bible before you go to the Sagrada Familia. I will surely go back to the Sagrada Familia again after read the Bible. Thanks Spain",
          "Visited here 2 days ago. Easy to find. We took the metro from paral-lel to la sagrida famillia station. Building is directly outside the station. Make sure you walk all around the buildings four sides. Take in all the intricate carvings and expertise in the carvings. We didnt go",
          "This place is without doubt the most spectacular I have seen! It defies belief that it\u2019s stood here for so long and is still not finished! The stained glass windows and statues are beautiful and outside the building is stunning!! Don\u2019t travel to Barcelona without visiting here",
          "Simply spectacular, it is worth making a stop on your trip to Barcelona, the most beautiful in the city",
          "This truly is something spectacular. Pictures even done professionally does not capture what you encounter when you approach this building. I walked there and I'm glad I did. As I passed the building blocking the view into the placa I was just shocked with it lit up at night and",
          "This was an amazing experience. Well worth paying to go up the tower to get beautiful views, great pictures and the experience of seeing Barcelona from different views, be aware lots of steep narrow steps to come down so not fun if fear of heights or physical disability. We",
          "Amazing seeing Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in person, place you must visit while staying in Barcelona. This have been over 100 years in construction and still unfinished, beautiful architecture of Antoni Gaud\u00ed",
          "I enjoyed the architecture by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and watching how the structure evolved over the years. It was a great experience.",
          "Not much to say just go see it. You dont have to be religious or into architecture. Its just an amazing ongoing work of art.",
          "We booked a guided tour. Well worth the money. Learnt a lot and the place is just wow... Recommend the place and most of all recommend the guided tour.",
          "When we arrived at the Sagrada Familia, looking at the building from the outside was amazing but once you enter, you will be completely blown away. Yes, there is still construction going on around the outside and there are areas inside that are still covered, but the beauty and",
          "Interesting cathedral, very different to the many others I\u2019ve visited. I understand the entrance fee pays towards construction but found it to be expensive for the amount of time required there.",
          "Stunning building, the light through the stained glass windows was impressive, it was sunny while we were there, if you go to Barcelona this is a must visit place but its busy so book online in advance",
          "Booked a few months in advance on their official website to make sure that we had tickets to go up the Navity facade. Cost EUR33 per person to enter the Church and also to take the lift up the Navity tower. Expensive, but a must do site in Barcelona so we paid up. The entrance",
          "As we often visit this area to visit family we have frequently seen the Sagrada from outside, as a Building Surveyor I was interested in the interior so on our latest visit 3rd February 2020 we went inside. It is actually not possible to describe, just the entrance doors are",
          "A must see ! A remarkable Catalan landmark out of the fantasy of the one and only remarkable Gaudi. It was a truly toucing and emotional experience.",
          "Make sure you book and get the audio guide, this place is fascinating and is well worth the money just make sure you book well in advance and get up the towers",
          "There are no words to descripte the visions of Gaudi. A Genius as Leonardo, Beethoven or van Gogh. Be there early!,",
          "What is a trip to Barcelona without a visit here? Every time i'm in the city, I try and at least take a little walk around to admire this incredible piece of architecture. Stunning.",
          "Beautiful unfinished building, should be completed 2026, a hundred years since Gaudi's death, the play of lights inside and size is simply a must see. I recommend to book tickets in advance (especially in high season)",
          "It\u2019s perfect colors, structure,details Gaudi thought of everything now he was not the firts one and now is just a combination of genius and crazy imagination, that gives us the opportunity to see it, is not finished they say 2026 , buy tickets in advanced lines are long",
          "What an amazing place. We paid for the audio and towers - honestly it\u2019s so cramped up there it\u2019s pointless paying the extra! And if you want to see inside for free there is International Mass on most Saturday & Sunday\u2019s and the acoustics for the choir are amazing. Will",
          "Our first stop in Barcelona\u2026La Sagrada Familia - a UNESCO World Heritage Site. WOW!!! what an amazing architecture created by Antoni Gaudi. Yes it is still under construction \ud83d\ude00. The project started in 1882 and the estimated date of completion is 2026. When this is",
          "An awesome place with a great guide. We were able to avoid the queues and the guide was very informative. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit and was so pleased to have done it.",
          "It is worth to visit the basilica, but book your tickets in advance! The waiting time without ticket is very long even in January.",
          "We did the English only skip the line tour with Jamie as our tour guide and thoroughly enjoyed it. Entry was very quick. Jamie was very knowledgeable and we would have missed so much of the detail in the design and structure had we done the tour alone. The light coming through",
          "It will leave you speechless, no doubt about that. Get ready for crowd, so book a ticket az least few days in advance.",
          "unlike any other church I have every visited. A absolute must do for everybody when going to Barcelona. I can also recommend the audio guide!",
          "If you can, visit in the winter months, its much quieter and easier to navigate and see things. Watch out for street merchants and pick pockets.",
          "Absolutely stunning. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Barcelona (and Barcelona is absolutely worth a visit!)",
          "We tried to visit on 27 December but could only visit the outside this time, tickets to enter the Basilica were sold in advance to 4 January!!",
          "Excellent place to visit..... very good with the audio tour. A definite must visit whilst in Barcelona!",
          "This tour was one of the best days I have ever enjoyed . The interior of the cathedral was literally the most beautiful church I have ever seen .",
          "I made it too late to enter the building. However, it's still worth walking around the outside of the building and soaking in its architectural beauty.",
          "Must see. You cannot even imagine, not really. I could go on and on about the genius of Gaudi, the influences of nature, the scale, etc. But at the end of the day, you just have to stand there and let is all wash over you. Yeah...it's like that. On a side note, I booked my",
          "Fantastic place to visit very busy and a bit expensive to see inside as you need a ticket would advise booking ahead of time",
          "If in Barcelona it\u2019s a must to see this cathedral that won\u2019t be finally completed until 2026. G\u00fcell\u2019s final and most passionate work of his lifetime! Buy tickets ahead of time long que always!! Definitely do the audio tour to get the most of it. Not easy to follow at times , but",
          "we got tickets for just the towers and abit of the inside of the sagrada. we did not do the audio tour. we got very cool pictures of the view from the bridge (only 20 or so people can stand of this) but then only small windows of opportunity to take some pics on the way down. i",
          "In a shabby part of town & the queues (in January) were long. The cranes & building work obviously ruining it but it is still fascinating to see such a massive weird building.",
          "I visited the Basilica when I was in college and it didn't leave as much of an impact on me then. Currently, the interior is almost complete, and the complex and unique architecture could really be appreciated. Recommend: Buy the tickets in advance from the official website.",
          "I was already amazed by the exterior of the church. Once stepped inside I was even more blown away by the great architecture inside. So make sure you buy a ticket online in advance. No need to buy the ticket to climb the towers. The basic entrance ticket is good enough. Arrive",
          "Walked to see the Basilica of the Sagarda Familia, unfotuanatly we had been walking all day , and my legs were tired , and we didn't think we could give going inside justice , so took pictures and walked around , I am a builder and was amazed how he created the structure , we",
          "A fantastic contemporary cathedral built bigger than those in the 13th and 14th century across the rest of Europe. A significant building! Whilst it is an amazing building and warrants a visit, it is very busy, lacks the serenity of a gothic building and visitors seem more",
          "It was a long wait on the line but totally worth it. It is impressive from the outside, but just WOW on the inside. Really impressive.",
          "We visited in late January, and although there were lots of people, it was not overcrowded. We bought tickets in advance, and everything went so smoothly, even though there were several lines to wait in (entry, security, audio guides, towers). The tower is not really for people",
          "Learning more about Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852\u20131926) was important to understand how such a vast project could be continued for so long.",
          "Imposing from the outside and inside. Need to book in advance and possibly avoid the midday crowds to enjoy it.",
          "Takes your breath away.. Have to visit. Save plenty of time so much to take in and loads to see around you",
          "This must see is worth the trouble to book the tickets and set aside at least 5 hours if you are even barely interested in this magnificent temple. Our second visit was better than our first 9 years ago, and I expect our next will exceed this one. It is a fantastic place filled",
          "Wonderful piece of architecture. What impressed me was how he incorporated his love for nature with his masterpiece. Also realizing mans limitations by not building higher than the highest mountain in the area. That was my take home line.",
          "The outlook and inside of the building is quite marvel and full of unexpected beauty. I am quite impressed by Gaud\u00ed\u2019s idea of design.",
          "Great place, architecture was incredible, as was the view from the top!!! Would highly recommend....",
          "The views and interior were breathtaking. Make sure you book your entrance prior, otherwise you will be disappointed if you can't get in.",
          "This is a modern interpretation of a cathedral. JTechnically not a cathedral but it looks like one. Just go and see for yourself. The stained glass windows and light effects. The internal structure of the thing. You just have to see it yourself. Truely awesome. Get a",
          "Great place to visit and if it's raining on your visit your going to be dry for a day Been here before and came back so its goto be good",
          "When I visited Barcelona for the first time in 2003 the building was under construction and predicted to take about ten more years. In December of 2019 it is still not finished and maybe it will never be but it has progressed quite a lot. The building is impressive but I am",
          "This is a very special place regardless if you're religious or not. The design and architecture involved with this place is truly a unique wonder.",
          "I recommend booking tickets well in advance to see the entirety of this wonderful place, as you can rarely get tickets on the day. To say this place exceeded our expectations would be an understatement - as its awe inspiring. Work still continues to extend and improve it to",
          "We bought tickets at the entrance. Waiting time to get inside around 15 minutes, the security check like on airport. After that it's just wooow... Amazing experience. Great work of art.",
          "Very interesting experience! The site still in construction but its one of the most interesting places I have ever seen. I'm very curious to see it done! \ud83d\ude04",
          "Get tickets in advance, enjoy the time, and do go up a tower...any tower...they're all worthwhile and not one is the best.",
          "This is a quitessentially Marmite building -you either love it or loathe it and it is impossible to be neutral. Due to the long queues and restricted time we had in the city we could not go inside but we walked around it both clockwise and anticlockwise to appreciate as many",
          "I have seen many churches around the world, but this one is at the very top of my list. It is truly awe inspiring. The architecture and the way the sun shines through the stained glass is mesmerizing. It's a bit pricey but for me, it was well worth it to see the beauty. We did",
          "We booked this months in advance and still had to q at the quick entry gates so really it isn't worth paying the extra. Obviously it's still a work in progress site so you will have areas closed off. Once inside it is absolutely stunning. no matter what your religion you will",
          "I was amazed at the lights inside the basilica, honestly so mesmerising! 100% recommend if you\u2019re coming to Barcelona, you don\u2019t wanna miss this! I\u2019d recommend going as early as possible.",
          "An amazing, unusual work of art. While the outside is remarkable for its detailed, ever changing facades, the inside is stupendous for its stained glass. It creates beautiful patterns of light in the interior of the basilica. We attended 9 am Sunday Mass and heard outstanding",
          "Definitely a gorgeous must-see stop in Barcelona - taking the audio tour is recommended as you get so much valuable information on the architecture and symbolism. Been twice now, and it doesn't disappoint.",
          "There's nothing else like this. Definitely do not skip this if you're in Barcelona. The architecture is unique due to the number of architects and length of time the building has been under construction.",
          "We purchased from official Sagrada web site and chose earliest English guide tour at 10:00 am. They let you in at 9:15 am. We walked around, then met at tour guide site. It is so incredible. You can easily spend more than an hour just viewing the outside of the building. There",
          "Booked the basic ticket in advance and access was very quick (in January). Fantastic experience to be inside the Basilica. To see it only from the outside would not be enough!",
          "Of course, we were expecting great things of The Basilica and we were in no way disappointed. The exterior takes your breath away but still doesn\u2019t prepare for the interior of this wonderful place. Every book referencing Barcelona includes information about La Segrada Familia",
          "Words don't do this treasure justice. I travelled all over Italy and France on this trip and my magical visit to Sagrada Familia was the highlight. I had no idea what to expect and was blown away. The audio tour was perfect. My visit evoked feelings of reverence, sadness,",
          "It\u2019s been 21 years since I last went. What a difference. We all stood and looked in awe. Hopefully be able to see it again in less than 21 years.",

          "Didn\u2019t get a skip the line pass, but went late in the afternoon and only stood in line for about 45 minutes. You\u2019ll learn most with the audiovisual tour which has many language options. Inspiring and impressive work of art with all the details and the story it tells inside and",
          "Prepare yourself for more security measures than an international airport! Haha But great and interesting place to visit and the museum is worth a look as well. Hand dryers in the bathroom didn\u2019t work and the water to wash your hands is icy which is weird...",
          "One of the wonderful Churches in the world !!! Tripe to the Barcelona without visiting the Sagrada Familia is a bad loosing at all . you would Wonder from its Greatness and glory !!!",
          "every year is getting better and better. I love this piece of art. Anyone who comes to Bcn should enter at least once in a lifetime here!",
          "Loved the audio guide that taught me much about the meaning behind the beautiful architecture and design of this Basilica.",
          "Sagrada Familla it took 150 years to built will not finish for another 7 years. located in the heart of Barcelona the lines are long I highly recommend it.",
          "Incredible building ! A must see. We went in the late afternoon with the sun coming through the stain glass windows.",
          "Certainly worth a visit, even if you find the architectural style somewhat audacious. It's an impressive feat of design and engineering and evokes a sense of grandeur and spiritualism, if not a little bit too sensational at times. I personally have mixed feelings about certain",
          "Architecture of this place is amazing. Though it is under construction for its towers, the visible part just mesmerises. From inside like any other famous church of Europe one can feel the richness. Taking an audio guide probably would have been best. We took a guided tour and",
          "What an amazing building to visit. Every angle has something to offer, and it\u2019s amazing that it\u2019s placed in the middle of a busy city. Building work currently going on",
          "One visit can't possibly cover all of the varied elements here, each time you look at something, you see something more. The audio support is critical to note Gaudi's intentions and detail, down to the lighting and colors noting east and west through upper windows. The modernism",
          "A masterpiece. I saw it first in 2007 and in 2020 it is even more beautiful! A very peaceful place and a true wonder of the world. A must see!",
          "Don\u2019t miss this if you visit Barcelona. I could have spent all day . The architecture is awesome . Book online for faster entry you won\u2019t be disappointed",
          "ONLY seven more years until they finish it. The outside is breathtaking. The inside is not as striking. Plenty of people admiring the work, but you can take pictures up close, from afar, or inside. The number one attraction in Barcelona.",
          "Buildings and buildings, but as they go, this one is an absolute stonker. No wonder its taken 75 million years to build (might need to fact check that). Really beautiful, make sure you book to go up one of the towers.",
          "We ended up coming to Sagrada Familia twice. The first time was on a Gaud\u00ed walking tour where we ended at the church and learned about the exterior. I had wanted a guided tour of the interior but availability was limited in New Years week until near the end of our trip, so we",
          "Not usually a fan of \u201cholly places\u201d but this Basilica is something different. Spare at least one hour for this amazing monument.",
          "One of Gaud\u00ed's remarkable works. Probably the most iconic place of worship in all of Europe. Must see.",
          "A must see, the place has some kind of a magic vibe to it, you can feel the good \"weirdness\" about the artist. It was very interesting to see that the actual mass was happening in \"underground\" church (didn't know such existed).",
          "Anton Gaudi started the construction of this basilica more than 100 years back and after several setbacks throughout its historical journey this massive structure stands tall in the middle of Barcelona commanding a response from all visitors. One can clearly see the difference",
          "The massive structure of this basilica catches your attention anywhere from Barcelona. When you think that almost 70% of the towers are yet to be finished - one can only imagine the imposing presence. This is a must see - no doubt. The inside of the church is almost finished -",
          "This is unlike ANY basilica you will see anywhere else in Europe. It is absolutely stunning and it is totally worth it to get a ticket and go inside. You HAVE to book your ticket in advance or you will not get inside when you get there. I booked a tour and I\u2019m so glad I did. It",
          "A lifetime of designing and planning by the artist that took another lifetime to build. Such a fascinating, beautiful creation that will come into full fruition in another few years. Will be back to view it when it is completed.",
          "First of all it wont be totally ready before 2026 for the 100y of the death of Gaudi, but basically only the big towers are missing, the inside is already pretty much done and already well worth the visit, I hope to go back in 2026 to see it fully completed",
          "If you only do one thing while your in this beautiful city you have to visit this amazing cathedral, it is out of this world and will definitely taking the wife to see it",
          "I found going in the late evening around 1500hr and start taking pictures, then did tour with guide for an hour, then I took some more pictures. WOW. Found the lighting inside Sagrada more prominent in the pictures and able to see the contrast. I went when it was raining and",
          "Stunning , magnificent ! We bought the tickets with tour guide and like every minute being there. Did not take a ride in the elevator, but even without it we were stunned by the view.",
          "Must see in Barcelona. Were lucky as their were not so many people (were all shopping...). Simply a crazy/amazing architecture",
          "So worth booking your space to see this wonder of a mans creative intelligence. The structure and colour touches the soul. Cant wait til 2026 to see it finished.",
          "Knowing a bit about the cathedral before I visited, I learned much more about it from actually being inside it. The interior is so impressive, and the lighting changes throughout the day, and season by season, that one visit is not enough to experience it. Unfortunately, I live",
          "Just amazing piece of architectural masterpiece from 1882! However it's still taking some years more before we can see the grand beauty of this cathedral.",
          "All great, nice, memorable. Get tickets ahead!!! It is nice to visit, also recommend to go to tower, in ase is nice weather, beautiful view. Worth to see. Must to see in Barcelona.",
          "Landmark and iconic structure but we did not enjoy it that much as it was still under renovation. There are many tourists around this spot of course and it is part of the hop on hop off bus ride organized by many companies.",
          "Amazing site to visit it was just grand. Much more bigger and impressive than expected. A Must see from inside. Pls take the audio guide tour",
          "Amazing Basilica, probably one of the most beautiful we have seen in Europe. How the light shines through the stained glass was cleverly thought out and very peaceful. We chose the audio tour which was very informative. A very unique Basilica that should not be missed!",
          "It was one of the best things in Barcelona to see. Skipped the line worked great!! Great audio for inside and outside.",
          "The story behind this great building is so intriguing, and the story of Guadi himself. This is well worth a visit but be prepared to spend at least 3 hours. Looking on the outside as well as the inside. Definitely worth getting the audio guide as it explains everything and",
          "We had a guided tour with a very competent tour guide and a fast entry, absolutely recommended. The technical equipment, a micro ear receiver for everyone, was amazingly good. The tour included the bus trip from Place Catalunya to the Sagrada Familia and was also very well",
          "Been to Barcelona a few times before but not been inside before. Booked online for guided tour 27euros which makes it much easier rather than waiting inline. The tour lasted 50 minutes and was worthwhile the local guide was very good she supplied head sets so we could hear her",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Have seen this building before on a couple of occasions but never been inside due to lack of planning. It was incredible and humbling and beyond words. Don\u2019t ever hesitate to go here you will be blown away!",
          "At least, in my opinion. Love Gaud\u00ed and modernism, and all the numbers and philosophy behind it. He was a real genius and it shows majestically in La Sagrada Familia. Highly recommended to take the guided visit, the guide will give you insights you won\u2019t hear on the audio guide.",
          "I saw the Sagrada Familia from the outside on a city bus tour years ago but am delighted that we took the time to go inside to discover more about its fascinating history and to observe the craftsmanship up close. The stained glass windows which cast beautiful colours over the",
          "Do yourselves a favor and don't just walk by and gape. Take a long hard look at the outside, learn a bit about the history and then buy the ticket to go inside. You will be amazed and you will wonder how what you saw on the outside, turns into what you see on the inside. Truly",
          "Amazing outside but definitely worth going inside too! The windows and whole experience is definitely worth it",
          "The most amazing church I could\u2019ve visited on this trip! It made Notre Dame look weak imo. It\u2019s amazing. Get your tickets with time though! We almost didn\u2019t get let in and it would\u2019ve been tragic to miss out!",
          "Visited after a visit 15 years ago and to see the development progress was amazing. Stunning site and is everything and more you expect it to be. It\u2019s very tourist heavy though so buy your tickets in advance or you won\u2019t get in unless your very lucky and after queuing for",
          "It is maybe the greatest construction work in Europe but with long lines. Bring some time and you might enjoy it.",

          "We didn't go into the cathedral on our first visit to Barcelona. Big mistake. We corrected the oversight in November 2018. It's wonderful to visit the classic cathedrals in Europe. Sagrada Familia is built with timeless Christian themes reimagined and executed by genius!",
          "FYI, this is a review of an atheist about a Catholic Church. I was amazed, a loss for words and a brought to tears. The desire of Gaudi to create a space that brings people into the presence of the divine is accomplished. The stained glass windows bring ethereal light into a",

          "This is the most incredible and stunning place I've ever seen. I've traveled a lot of the world and seen many churches, but nothing compares to this. I had been to the basilica before, but hadn't spent the money to go inside. I figured this might be my last trip to Barcelona",
          "I know this Basilica is what Barcelona is known for, but the inside is even more incredible than I could have anticipated! You would never guess the stained glass that comes alive on the inside! However, you really do have to book this ahead of time because it's even hard to",

          "The exterior of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia has so much going on from every angle that you could spend an entire day looking at it and still not see all the details and the symbolism. It is fascinating and exceptional - like nothing else anywhere. But if you don\u2019t going inside you will",

          "Obviously this is one of the most famous places in Barcelona, if not the country of Spain, and it lives up to the \"hype.\" I'd also suggest the guided tour for insight from a local and an informative presentation. If you can swing it, I'd suggest traveling off-season to avoid",

          "We purchased tickets including the passion tower. We were awed by both the interior and exterior of the magnificent Basilica of the Sagrada Familia. This alone made our visit to Barcelona worthwhile. We are looking forward to visit it again in 2026 when it is scheduled to be",
          "La Sagrada Familia is one of Gaudi's most famous works in Barcelona. It's a giant basilica that has been under construction since 1882. Gaudi combined Gothic and Art Nouveau architecture for his design of the church. Absolutely stunning and takes your breath away.",
          "One of the most iconic building in the world. We paid the extra for the audio guide and will definitely recommend it, I saw people just walking around taking selfies, I couldn't see the point in walking into this magnificent structure just for facebook / instagram photos.",
          "This is probably the most visited attraction in Barcelona for a good reason. It is spectacular. The unusual architecture and stained glass windows make this like no other cathedral in Europe. Be sure to get your tickets well in advance, so you can get the time slot you want. If",

          "I went to Sunday mass, be there by 830AM latest. It's an international mass, an hour long. What a way to see the church! You can gaze and gaze and watch the stained glass light up over time, the choir sings and it reverberates beautifully. After the mass you can roam around",
          "Location: West of the city. You literally can't miss it! Price: Varied depending on what you want to do. We paid to go up the towers and audioguide (30E for students, 32 for adults) If you're intending on going up the towers, you really should book. In fact, if you want to go",

          "This was my second time to Barcelona and the first time I decided to skip entering due to the price. It was 100% worth it to pay to go in. We made sure to also do the guided tour. He was very energetic and provided great information.",

          "There is not much more to say as all was mentioned already within previous great reviews. Doesn't matter if you believe or not, this place is a must to visit as it is entirely extraordinary and beautiful in any of its aspects! The creator - Gaudi - was a very special person!!!",
          "This is a masterpiece of architecture not yet finished. The Cathedral has been the vision of the legendary ar4chitect Gaudi, who prematurely died in a tragic traffic accident before he was able to see his masterpiece completed. the gothic cathedral is a sight to see. No words",
          "A truly stunning landmark. No words or photos do it justice, it\u2019s a must visit. It\u2019s hard to comprehend what it took to lift this from design to real life. It feels authentic and futuristic at the same time. I wonder how this will be viewed in hundreds of years time.",
          "absolutely stunning and mesmerising, both from outside as well as from inside. Should be visited both in the daytime as well as in the evening time. This is considered as the pinnacle of Gaudi' creation, although incomplete for over 100 years!",
          "We had a wonderful afternoon tour with Mareia as our guide. Only two couples so it felt like a private tour. No lines or waiting and a great way to see the cathedral and appreciate it thoroughly. Mareia was the best!",
          "As another reviewer said, photos and videos of Sagrada Familia do no do it justice. However if you are visiting I would highly recommend \"doing your homework\" on Gaudi and this amazing building. Look at the photos; watch the documentaries. Prior to our visit we'd been told to go",
          "It\u2019s just one of those places you have to go to and see for yourself. It\u2019s definitely an architectural masterpiece and just mind blowing.",
          "This was my #1 favorite architectural gem in Barcelona. Definitely book a tour to learn the history and the nuances of this magnificent work of art. I plan to go back in 2027 to see its completion. Best to go on a sunny day. The stained glass will not disappoint.",
          "This is one of the most famous attractions in Barcelona you shouldn't miss. Unique architecture designed by Gaud\u00ed. I don't know how to describe the beauty of this place. Just so amazing!",
          "The tour was excellent it\u2019s a must see of Barcelona we enjoyed every moment and would do the tour again if given the chance. The tour guide was knowledgeable and took time with the group to explain the details about the architecture and the details about gaudi and the people",
          "Timed tickets. Walked around the outside first to get a feel of it, then went in early and was ok. Audio tour was good and can go at your own pace. Fascinating detail everywhere. Interior is really beautiful with light coming through the stained glass. There is option to",
          "Worth seeing but I would advise booking in advance online as we were told to do this on arrival and had to wait an hour before we could go inside.",
          "the guided tour was a waste of 27 euros as the guide had very poor english. it is really over priced for what it is. the church is definetly a good sight to visit though",
          "Obviously inside atmosphere has a major influencing effect on mankind. from outside it is also impressive but from inside, it is much impressive",
          "Impressive piece of architecture, very interesting to see. However, we used the audio guide, which was available in our language, but the guide was a bit boring in my opinion, it tried to guide you where to look but it was very difficult to find sometimes, and the guide would",
          "It's amazing to see and the architecture is amazing. The pictures display more vivid colours, but don't they all. The different light between morning and evening on both sides of the Basilica is well worth the visit, and so is everything else",

          "Wow! We bought tickets online ahead of our journey which we strongly recommend as its super busy. We also took the audio guide which was just enough information for the family. (Kids are tweens and young teenager) And we took the elevator up The Nativity Tower. Great views but",
          "the experience is much more complete with audio guide! highly recommended. I am wowed by Gaudi\u2019s #sagradafamilia and his intent to showcase all the \u2018stories\u2019 on Christianity. I am not religious nor familiar with them prior to the visit but now have been \u2018educated\u2019 well",
          "Anyone visiting Barcelona and missing this Basilica is shortchanging themselves. It is utterly fantastic and probably the most amazing church we have ever seen!",
          "My husband and I are not religious but this was a beautiful experience that we both really enjoyed. Gaudi was so creative and had such ingenuity you could not help but marvel at the work that has been done here.",
          "If you visit anywhere in Barcelona, visit here. Every member of the family were transfixed! We visited on the last day of our weekend trip, having bought tickets earlier online for an audio tour including a trip up one of the towers. The audio headphones told us everything we",
          "We visited in the off season and this is the time to go. No line. Not many people and had this beauty to very few people. We visited in the late afternoon to see the sunset shine through the stained glass which is highly recommend. If you go up the towers, it is kind of a let",
          "It truly has to be experienced. Gaudi was a genius! I've never been in a space like that. We just walked around with the audio tour and learnt about how it is organized and some of the meanings of things.",

          "Even when you see this in person you cannot take in the magnitude of its beauty and all of he work that gone into it. It also takes a long time to read about it. However it is an absolute must must must do while in Barcelona",
          "The guided tour was very good and the church itself is spectacular. Go in the afternoon to see the amazing colorful light streaming in.",
          "Booked through Julia travel. The guided tour was great! Our guide spoke fluent English and was able to point out many special points of interest. We went near sunset which really was wonderful for seeing the stained glass!",
          "This is probably the most spectacular building that we have been into anywhere in the world. The attention to detail was amazing and everywhere you turn provides additional surprises. We can't wait to see the finished product in 2026, the 100th anniversary of Gaudi's death.",
          "Absolutely beyond incredible. My daughter and I visited last month and we were even MORE amazed. The Audio Guide is an absolute MUST. The amount of information you get from that is incredible. We went 14:45 so we could be there around sunset time to enjoy the beautiful",
          "This is well worth the walk from the city centre. It is a spectacular sight and a truly unique edifice in an already beautiful city. Combine it with a longer walking tour of this great \"walking\" city!",
          "Having only seen photos of the cathedral before, you can\u2019t be prepared for this experience. From the outside, it\u2019s quite hard to understand the concept, it\u2019s so huge. Photos can only show small parts of it at any one time. As you step inside you can only gaze in amazement. The",
          "You have to go and see it. The outside is outstanding. The inside also. You must take a walk around the outside of this basilica.",
          "The church was amazing. The structure was awesome. The Gothic design can't be found elsewhere. Worth going for a visit.",
          "Each time we are in Barcelona we visit the Sagrada Familie. This time we walked around the area and enjoyed the outside of the Basilica from each corner. Beautiful to see!",
          "This is a must visit! The tower walk is ok but not a must. There are less people there in the morning, however fighting the crowds are worth it in order to see the sun through the windows...it is breath taking! Make sure you the the audio guide, there is so much to learn about",
          "Great peace of modern architecture and place of worship bearing Hindu it\u2019s really feels peaceful visiting basilica great tour enjoyed every bit of it",
          "Nice place to visit with lot of history and how Gauddi was inspired by his love for Jesus. Day was very nice to visit however too many people to negotiate your way through. Audio was great help.",
          "You can get different opinions about Gaudi's architecture, to me personally it looks kind of creepy on the outside, was not impressed at all. Have not managed to go inside though, which it seems it looks better, prices are around 24\u20ac per person and they have specific time slots",
          "So amazing!! This is now my favorite cathedral to have visited. It is so amazing & beautiful on the inside. The use of stained glass is amazing on the inside!! I really want to go back after they finish it. So glad we got to see this. Unfortunately our tour was in the afternoon",
          "Haven't seen something as beautiful as Sagrada Familia. Gaudi was genius! Such unbelievable building! So light and full of space. Being inside it's like being in wonderful forest. To understand - easier to come and see with own eyes. With different Barcelona City Cards the",

          "Out of my four months in Europe, La Sagrada Familia was the highlight. Just walking up to the building is absolutely stunning - it feels like you're dreaming. Paying to go inside is definitely worth it, and I think if you are going to go inside just one Gaudi building, it should",
          "Amazing. It ticked all boxes and then some. Audio guides are really good and helped us to spot things that we wouldn\u2019t have seen. Staff were really friendly and helpful",

          "Amazing. Stunning architecture. Gaudi was incredible. All views were amazing. Definitely go up one of the towers",
          "You haven't seen Barcelona unless you visited Sagrada Familia. This is not just the greatest Gaudi's work but it's also one of the greatest Basilicas in the world. Gaudi worked on it for over 40 years until his death in 1926. Nowadays, architects are still working and pushing it",
          "The unfinished exterior has adorned travel magazines and inspired travelers to come to Barcelona so this was one of the most anticipated highlights of trip You can take a lot of pictures of the exterior but what's surprising is the interior. The minimalist and nature-inspired",
          "Beautiful architecture and scenery around would recommend everyone to check it out atleast once in their life thanks",
          "Cant comment on the towers but the rest of the Basillica was absolutely stunning and definitely a must see attraction if visiting Barcelona. Its unlike any other building I've seen and the inside will really surprise you. The area around also has many gift shops that are better",
          "A word of warning....book early if you want to go inside \ud83d\ude25 But...It is absolutely amazing from the outside as well. There will be crowds, but with patience you will get that photo. Every side of the structure was another delight and I will definitely see inside next time. Well",
          "We enjoyed this experience. December is not crowded. The line was not long I imagine coming in high season you would want the fast track . We had a personal tour guide but you can manage fine with audio guide.",
          "This church is unique from outside to inside. In december it wasn't crowded at all and we didn't wait at all to get in.",
          "We last visited in 2007 and it was good to see the changes. The basilica is just breathtakingly beautiful and I spent a lot of time just soaking up the atmosphere and gazing at the many fine details. We also had booked for the tower visit. This was good but I must warn that the",
          "Just overcrowded unfinished and Oversold Barcelona. Has so much better to offer. It was just not worth the time and expense taken to see a tacky Vision of paradise.",
          "if you are in Barcelona and can only do one thing, this is the one you want to pick. The most beautiful church you will ever see.",
          "Not like any other Cathedral we've ever seen both inside and out. We bought our tickets directly from the website with the audio guide and it was well worth it. This place is a must visit!",
          "Absolutely breath-taking. I have never been this mesmerised. Tip is to go there before the sun sets and stay there til it gets a bit dark - so you can get the feel of when lights reflect inside and when it's dark.",
          "Don't miss this, so do yourself a favour and book well ahead of your planned visit. The idea is that you take the lift up and walk back down, stopping at each view point to see up close Gaudi's creations. Strange, beautiful, weird & breathtaking describe this place.",
          "I was really overwhelmed by the size and texture of the building. Internal appearance was full of sights so enormous and impressive. For your note, Tower Access appeared to be somewhat disappointing. For the type of heavy walking ups and down especially for my age over",
          "The architecture is just astounding to stand and watch and this gem is right in the middle of the city and very accessible to view and enjoy. A definite must see on your travels",
          "We had skip the line tickets. This also included an audio guide which was a little hard to follow but there were lots of personnel standing throughout that were very helpful to point us in the right direction. This church was like nothing else. Amazing, unique and beautiful!",
          "Always worth a visit. Visited again this month with my husband and it was brilliant. The basilica is immense and beautiful and awe-inspiring. I've gone with and without paying and recommend getting a ticket. With a ticket you get to explore the interior and see much more of",
          "One of the places in the world you have to see in person to appreciate. Book well ahead, but the process is very easy and well organized. The staff is very helpful and they limit the number of guests so although its busy its not overwhelming. Definitely book the additional trip",
          "This was the highlight of my Barcelona trip. The structure and the art is out of this world. Beautiful is understatement. I cannot find a right word to describe how beautiful this church is.",
          "This Basilica is truly the most amazing cathedral! You must go between 2 and 4 when the sun is shining! There are no words to express the beauty!",
          "An absolute must if you are visiting Barcelona. Wow, what a place, so much to learn and see. Make sure you purchase your tickets in advance, we did. If you don't expect to have to wait a long time.",
          "The Sagrada Familia is absolutely incredible. I was awestruck looking at the light on the inside and the incredible sculptures throughout. Definitely do the (free!) audio guide and, while not a must do, the towers were also a great way to get a high-up view of Barcelona.",
          "I had mixed feelings about Sagrada Familia. I thought the outside was actually quite ugly architecturally, with the towers looking like somewhat pointed churros and the overall texure and lines of the building being rather underwhelming. The interior, however, is truly gorgeous,",
          "I have visited a lot of churches in Europe but never seen one that's so beautiful and amazing!! Wish my sister-in-law, who is extremely religious were here! It was truly unforgettable!",
          "I've visited a fair amount of churches and this one is just incredible. I thoroughly recommend visiting it and planning to spend a fair amount of time there. (Hint: pre-book your tickets online - you'll need to specify an hour of the day.) I did the towers and toured the church",
          "Not at all what I expected. This place is magnificent and a must place to visit. I only regret that I could not have spent more time to fully emerse myself in the beauty of this space.",
          "I had very low expectations for this Basilica. I have seen in from the outside on my last trip but didn\u2019t bother going in because I didn\u2019t think it looked that great. This trip my friend and I bought tickets (even though quite pricey) and went inside. I was speechless!! This is",

          "You have never seen anything like this cathedral because it is one of a kind. The architect uses nature as a theme for the representation of God's love for humankind. It is a magnificent structure that focuses on Joseph, Mary, and Jesus as a family, hence the name. All the",

          "This church \u26ea\ufe0f and it\u2019s architecture and beautiful structures inside out are breathtaking. There were many times I came to a point where I couldn\u2019t even speak, that\u2019s how wowing this particular structure was. I think this was my favorite sight in Spain that I visited. Senor",
          "Never ever have I felt as much joy for colour and architecture. Prebuy tickets online, go early to get past security. amazing gift shop.",
          "An architectural marvel. I would not classify it as elegant. It is extremely ornate, and in a load way. One can be overwhelmed by how spectacular it is both on the interior and exterior. This could easily be the world's three most visited churches. Construction began in 1882.",
          "An architectural masterpiece, a place of amazing beauty and spiritual peace. Nothing more to say. Go see it.",

          "The outside of the church is the greatest aspect of this church in my opinion. It is quite a site to behold. The detail, the history, all very fascinating. I paid to do an audio tour on the inside and if I\u2019m being honest, I just was not impressed. Yes, it is definitely unique",
          "This was arguably the site that was most hyped up before our trip to Spain. And YET, it blew me away. No words can express the genius and majesty of this place. Do yourself a favor and see it for yourself; and when you do, PLEASE GO INSIDE! (I don't understand people who elect",

          "While this is worth seeing and learning about, I must admit, it was not my favorite. It is overwhelming but there was something that was both missing and too much. Don't miss it, but go early. If you want to learn and are not patient, the audio tour leaves a bit to be desired.",
          "One word Spectacular. The towers were closed due to winds but an unbelievable place. Purchase tickets from official website and you will have a very short wait to enter as you go at specified time. We we\u2019re awestruck at its beauty. Walking the entire block around the",

          "This mind-blowingly dazzling architectural marvel is a must see in Barcelona. The building is entirely funded by ticket sales and is expected to be completely finished in 2026. Book a tour to avoid the lines outside. I highly recommend going up one of the spires!  Two were open when I went in 2013.",
          "It was awe inspiring on the first step inside! The sheer grandeur of it all was breathtaking, the self guided audio tour is pretty interesting. And we got the fast pass which I believe is a must! Will it ever be used as it was supposed to be, a quiet place or prayer...probably never which is sad. But I did enjoy the visit!",

          "This church is fantastic. The facades are beautiful, but also the church inside is wonderful, with enormous columns and spectacular windows. Altough the church isn't completed, it is one of the places to visit if you are in Barcelona.",

          "Absolutely amazing. The scale of the building is immense! Tickets were a minimum of \u20ac20, so we enjoyed the buildings architecture from the outside. There are bells every 15 minutes, and on the hour there is a very pleasant chorus of bells from all the towers, quite unlike cathedral bells from others that I have heard.",
          "Wonderfully historic and modern art the same time. Booking can be a little confusing with so many options available different prices if you pay online. Ladies must dress appropriately not showing too much leg. The church is incredible inside, the stained glass windows and high beams are definitely worth the entrance free",
          "I think La Sagrada Familia is a really imposing building. First time I saw it I was in shock about how intricate it is. It\u2019s huge amount of culture in one place, and a vision of an excellence architect. By the time I went there (October) I \u2026",

Sadly, its still in renovation so still waiting to be restored to its former glory. Did not get a chance to go in as the ques were long and limited for time, but will revisit again to see inside.",

          "Incredible! No surprise there:) This place was breathtaking, both inside and out. My favorite part was taking the elevator up into the columns. It\u2019s a little extra to do that, but worth it! You have to wait in line, but it went by really quick. They have an audio tour too which was awesome.",
          "A must see. The pics. and anything I can write cannot even come close to describe to you how awesome this place is. The reason for the 4 \ud83c\udf1f is because the security guards there are intense. You'll see what I mean. I hope this helps.",
          "Out of this world! Must visit site in Barcelona. Loved the collation of different types of architecture. Stained glass windows give different elements of beauty at different times of the day all in different hues. Bucket list things.",
          "It\u2019s funny that someone gave La Sagrada Familia a bad review because they complained that it is still under construction.  HEY! That is the Whole point. It had taken more than 135 years of work so far to construct this world-class \u2026",
          "Took my breath away\u2764 Really amazing! The moment I stepped into the place, I had goosebumps. Really though, Gaudi really did great on this design. I may sound overreacting  but there is a peaceful and calmness feels when you're inside the \u2026",
          "A must-visit spot! A lovely landmark with inspirational architectural work, around 80 years to completion yet it's already spectacular and iconic in Barcelona if not Spain.\nThe surrounding is green, I hope it will be maintained and be improved in this era of over-visitations.\nI love Barcelona.",
          "Blew all expectations out of the water!\n\nWas in Barcelona to celebrate getting engaged with my partner so naturally, we had to book tickets to La Sagrada Familia. Upon arrival, the queue was quite long but moved fairly quickly. Once going \u2026",

          "Gaudi\u2019s masterpiece was amazing.  Not only is every inch of the exterior covered it art, it all has a meaning that fits into the design.  The way the light hits the surfaces on the interior is breathtaking.  \n\nI highly recommend going with \u2026",
          "Wow just wow. Amazing place to visit! Make sure you book your tickets in advance and use the official Sagrada Familia website for the best price. Don't forget to visit the museum that is included in the price. It is perhaps the most unique piece of Architecture in Europe. Top 5 places to visit in Barcelona for sure. Highly recommended.",
          "An absolutely astounding and mesmerising building. The audio tour gives lots of information about the history, design and construction. It's not cheap to enter, but considering the money goes towards completing the building it's acceptable. \u2026",
          "Cool place to visit. Lots of beauty to see and enjoy. Try and schedule a time that music is playing. Prayer chapel available although you will need to cover your shoulders. Large gift shop. Construction ongoing at all times, but it does not \u2026",

          "Don\u2019t miss out on the gem of Barcelona. The tickets can be purchased in advance on the Basilica Foundation website. This ensures your money is supporting the basilica and doesn\u2019t have added fees. Going inside is 100% worth the time and money and I suggest the audio guide to gain a full understanding of everything you see.",
          "Buy tickets ahead of time, time slots do sell out. For whatever reason the cheapest tickets without the audio guide will sell out before the others? Get the audio guide, it's very informational and will give you more context as you walk \u2026",
          "Inside is nothing like you would imagine.. worth a visit.. the Nativity Tower gives you a glimpse of the incredible work on the peaks and a tiny portion of the city.. only a lift going up and 15 minutes of very narrow stairs going down.. recommend it.!",
          "Iconic, must-see landmark. Audio tour is worth it. Expect to spend 45mins just following the audio guide, more if you linger and just soak in the architecture. Best time to go is  mid to late afternoon (before 5pm), to see the sunlight filter through the stained glass windows.",
          "This place doesn't really need a view, you simply can't come to Barcelona and not see it, architecturally it is really nice to look at, it is crowded outside but that is to be expected. For the best photos I'd suggest going early morning or late evening. Then look at the other fantastic places in this wonderful city.",

          "This blew my mind when you walk in and see all the colours for the first time. You have to go during the golden hour for the best experience and photos! Trust me it's worth the wait! Get the audio tour as well, the knowledge makes it so \u2026",
          "This is amazing piece of art and architecture.\nDefinitely worth a visit and not only one time.\nI have visited it 3 times every year I have visited Barcelona. But a ticket in advance with possibility to go to the one of the towers, from the top you can see amazing views of the Barcelona. \nLove this place a lot.",
          "This church is one of the reasons I know Barcelona. It is fantastic no matter during the daytime or night. I booked the ticket online with the earliest time of the day. It's really good to visit the church in morning. The sunshine goes \u2026",

          "Stunning building with amazing interior! It's recommended to buy the tickets online beforehand. It was also a nice surprise to find out that people under 30 get a 50% discount. There's quite an interesting museum inside, which is also worth visiting.",

          "Words can't describe the beauty of the light that comes through those stained-glass windows. A basilica like no other, it puts Saint Peters, Notre Dame, and Westminster to shame with the elegance of its interiors and the tenderness and power of its facades. This alone is worth traveling across the world to see.",
          "Another place you need to book well in advance. \nFortunately you are still able to admire it from the outside. It\u2019s truly magnificent and unique. I love that you could visit again and it won\u2019t be the same. It\u2019s still in progress and yet still extraordinary.",
          "Sagrada Familia is one of the most beautiful churches I have seen. The structure is massive, perfectly thought out. The stained glass windows are absolutely stunning. Buy your tickets ahead of time as it does sell out and be on time. It is \u2026",
          "What an incredible space. Go inside and take the audio tour. It's a fascinating history and really worth while being a part of it while it's still under construction. Don't forget to go and see the museum after the main tour for more behind the scenes of the craftsmanship and design.",

          "Wonderful building. Definitely take audio guide because you will miss a lot of details there. Visit to the towers is also great. In my case, I have visited Nativity facade tower since you can choose only one. Staircase is really narrow and \u2026",
          "Sagrada Familia was amazing. Feel honoured to have been whilst it is still being completed! It is due to be completed by 2026 so make sure you see it before then. The audio guide is good but worth taking your own headphones as they plug \u2026",
          "Had no idea what to expect, but I've never had such a reaction to a basilica before - definitely the best part of our trip to Barcelona so far. Photos cannot do it justice. We got the audio guide which was worth doing. Definitely go here, even if you do nothing else in Barcelona.",
          "A modern wonder of the world in the making. Come see this for sure. If you come to Barcelona you MUST see this. It's perhaps the most unique piece of Architecture in Europe and maybe on earth. The scales are massive and still under construction. 100% a must do.",
          "World class, truly unique cathedral designed by Gaudi. An icon of Barcelona, the cathedral is still being built nearly a century later! Make sure to book your tickets well in advance and budget 1.5-2 hours. Definitely include one of the towers in your tour, which will add about thirty minutes. A must visit!",
          "La Sagrada Familia is incredible! If you're in Barcelona and don't visit this place you're not experiencing Barcelona properly. The history of the church is truly incredible, as the church is still being built to this day. Definitely stop by here the views are legendary.",
          "If you love art and churches, this is the most beautiful piece of architecture in the entire world. Really worth visiting to spend time falling in love with every corner and colour! Just book your tickets in advance to save a lot of time and don't buy the tickets for the towers as for me it wasn't worth at all.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking.\nThis is a perfect fusion of creative genius, time, evolution and beauty.  Each detail is perfected and it is even more stunning inside.  I thought I wouldn't bother with the ticket price because the outside was awe inspiring enough but the inside is something else.",
          "Never-ending colossal church designed by Gaud\u00ed and which is still under construction. Truly a masterpiece, an icon of Barcelona, but it cleary became much more of a business rather than a religious temple. In any case, if it's the architecture that matters, who cares... just pay and enjoy.",
          "Beautiful. Weird. Unusual. Unique. Ugly. Part finished. Fantastic. Morbid. Incredible .Popular. Historic. All words you could use depending on which part you look at. Everyone takes pictures of the beautiful parts but little pictures are \u2026",
          "Stunningly beautiful. Worth every penny to go inside. The security was a real pain and very poorly run, so be ready for that. I recommend going as early as possible to avoid the crowds and get a glimpse as the the morning sun shines through the stained glass windows.",
          "Absolutely stunning inside and out. I would highly recommend this place. I recommend you purchase your tickets online as the lines can get very long. There is a separate line for online bookings.",
          "Without a doubt one of the most stunning churches I have ever seen. It is absolutely worth the price to see the interior. Go in just before the sun sets to see the best colors through the stained glass.",
          "Amazing place to visit! We ordered tickets online ahead of our visit and were able to go up the Nativity Tower.  We enjoyed being able to walk around and spend as much time as we wanted admiring the masterpiece.  Will be back once it is completed.",
          "A must see. Unlike any other cathedral in the world. Due the tour and see the interior. So much thought and detail into everything from the tone and color of the stained glass windows to reflect the sunrise and sunsets differently, to the unique tree like pillars that give it its unique shape and support. We spent hours here.",
          "It is such a marvelous and beautiful monument that is full of architectural grandeur and life. It is surely a must see for all age groups and of special interest to those that want to observe the minute details, vibrant interiors, \u2026",
          "The Most Fantastic Building in Barcelona. One of the best place I've visited in a long time, well worth the trip up there. You must walk up the tower, cross the bridge and go down the next tower. Brilliant views from up there!! Dont bother \u2026",
          "This is truly a \"world wonder\" in it's own rite.  The magnificent design by Gaudy is an architectural masterpiece. It will not be completed for10 years or more, but one has to wonder how it was constructed from the beginning.  Be sure to \u2026",
          "The most wonderful church. It cost about 30 euros to enter and explore the inside of this construction but it's worth every penny. it's not that far from the center of Barcelona. You can easily take a walk from the port of Barcelona, I've done it under an hour of walking (not jogging).",
          "One of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. the interior of the Sagrada Familia makes such a strong impression that it took me at least a half of hour to get to myself after I went out. Amazing colors that change as the sun moves and shines a mosaic on the windows. Must see.",
          "You don't realize nor appreciate the true beauty of this iconic cathedral until you actually go see for yourself. I never realized how colorful this place. I was taken aback a little and in awe. Gaudi is truly a remarkable artist and what \u2026",
          "Of course we had to visit Sagrada familia when we were in Barcelona. \nThe church is truly amazing. Both on the inside and outside. We went up in the tower to see the stunning view. It was beautiful. \nThe windows of the church is really nice \u2026",
          "Fantastic architecture. Simply breathing. Never seen a cathedral so grand and purely artistic. Great tourist destination for families, groups, friends and even solo. It's right by the subway so pretty easy to access. Lots of restaurants and shops to get food or souvenirs. Very worth the time.",
          "Be careful you can buy tickets but the Sagrada Familia is closed till September, even though you bought a ticket for July...",
          "Amazing. Audio tour is good but a little too much information. Sunset was a great time for the red and yellow stained glass. Nativity Towers were cool but somewhat unimpressive, the view is just of some blocks of Barcelona.",
          "As a Foreigner Tourist i didn\u2019t know that you have to book or buy a ticket for entrance when i went to buy they said all sold !! Btw i enjoy the area around  ( you must check out they website before you come )",
          "This is one of the most amazing places created by human beings, it must be seen by everyone.  It has changed so much since the last time I was here which must be 12 years ago and it still isn't finished.  It is truly humbling seeing it. \u2026",
          "It's so hard to put into words. Pictures don't come close to doing it justice. It's just spectacular! We did the audio tour and went up in the passion tower. The detail is unbelievable and truly impressive. A must visit.",
          "Absolutely incredible to see both inside and out. I\u2019d suggest getting an audio guide so that you get a lot more history, context, and overall explanation about the church. Would not recommend going up one of the towers because you only get \u2026",
          "This place is, in a word, breathtaking!  The audio tour is worth it if you want to get a more detailed description of the different areas.  As soon as you get in and look up you are overcome by the sheer magnitude of imagination and \u2026",
          "Utterly stunning inside and out. Very surprising how light and spacious the building seems from the inside. Book well ahead to make sure you can go when you are in the area as it is busy. Going up the towers is well worth it for the views, \u2026",
          "I love it , it\u2019s amazing how the bit all the things together you need one day to see every details in each corner, I was lucky because it was Christmas time \ud83e\udde1",
          "This structure takes your breathe away from the outside in. The building is beautifully build, if you didn\u2019t buy a ticket don\u2019t worry you can buy your ticket there and hop on the line which moves pretty fast no long wait. However I got \u2026",
          "On of the most popular places in Barcelona, a lot of tourists but definitely worth to see it even if cathedra is not finished yet. View is speak less",
          "Absolutely stunning work of art. A must visit if you are in Barcelona. I have seen many Catholic Churches all across Europe but this has to be the most unique one. No photos can justify how gorgeous this place is. Wish the build was complete.",
          "Amazing. If you have the chance to go inside the church, do it. If not, take a whole walking trip around so you are still able to see the amazing architecture outside the building. There is a tremendous amount of history and brilliant minded architecture going on with this building and it is truly a sight to see.",
          "An overwhelming place. Even a non-religious person would appreciate the genius and dedication of the architect (and his colleagues and successors). Audio guide is highly recommended.",
          "One of the best and exited places in the world. It is must see in Barcelona. Book tickets in advance in order to go inside.",
          "Mind blown.\n\nNever imagined a man-made place like this could exist.\n\nBeing still actively worked on (since 1882!), this neo-Gothic revolutionary architectural / artistic masterpiece is well worth the visit. \n\nNot cheap, and takes a while to cover it all (I recommend following the supplied audio-guides), but totally worth it.",
          "This is a must place to visit Barcelona. Keep in mind that the building is still under construction. The interior of the cathedral is just simply amazing. Make sure you also visit their towers and have a great view of Barcelona. Simply amazing!",
          "No words for Gaudi's contribution in the field. His designs create magic. One can witness his efforts to go beyond the limits. Overall height is around 175 meters if am not wrong. The site is still under construction. It's always better to \u2026",
          "Spectacular place to visit. An amazing building that is truly awesome. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area! Would advise buying tickets online in advance to save the queue!",
          "Come here even if it's the only \"touristy\" thing you will do in Barcelona! Amazing! Worth paying for the audio guide service. Don't forget to visit the museum that is included in the price. I don't think you need to go up the towers.. one of the best things I have seen",
          "Amazing architecture, very expensive for what it is in my personal opinion.\nYou pay extra for the tower ticket which is a rip off, you go on a tiny lift to the top and then have to walk down 400 steps, yes you get to view Barcelona from the \u2026",
          "A must view once in a lifetime destination. The architect has designed a masterpiece. Attention to detail is awesome. When descending the 400 stairs you will appreciate the attention to detail. Breathtaking.",
          "La Sagrada Familia is absolutely stunning. The moment you first step out of the metro and turn to look at it, it definitely took my breathe away. The details and the sheer size of it is incredible. I bought my tickets in advance and was \u2026",
          "Beautiful. Weird. Unusual. Unique. Ugly. Part finished. Fantastic. Morbid. Incredible .Popular. Historic. All words you could use depending on which part you look at. Everyone takes pictures of the beautiful parts but little pictures are \u2026",
          "Stunning. Definitely a must see in Barcelona. Even if you're not religious. Recommend getting tickets online ahead of time - and booking in for the electronic guided tour. Much more interesting when you know how much work has and continues to go into it.",
          "Amazing building with lots of gidden elements. It is very crowded and you need to book in advance but it's still very nice to see and I also recommend the audio guide. The facades are incredible and the insides are mesmerizing. A true work of art that I can recommend to anyone!",
          "An amazing piece of architecture. It was very busy, and all the basic tour tickets had sold out. We weren't prepared to pay the next ticket price up, as the kids would not have appreciated it! \n\nWe got some nice photos, best taken from the lake.",
          "This is my second visit to Sagrada Familia. The last time was 7 years ago and some more of the church is completed. Last time I visited a part of the museum which had Gaudis inspiration from plants etc - this time I did not see it. I am \u2026",
          "Wish we could have explored even more of this basilica, but it's easy to see why it's highly regarded as one of the most jaw dropping architecture wonders of the world. From the outside, it's definitely impressive to see every small detail \u2026",
          "Beautiful place and definitely a highlight of Barcelona. Very expensive, but it's worth it I guess as the money they go back as an investment for the cathedral. Book tickets in advance, otherwise the queue is enormous. Enjoy the moment and \u2026",
          "Literally the best place to visit in Barcelona. Astonishing view of the 172 meters high basilica. Totally magical inside. BUY ONLINE AND COME IN TIME because of the queues and lots of tourists. The site is simple and allows one to get \u2026",
          "Too beautiful for words. Anyone visiting Barcelona has to see this magnificent beauty of genius. The audio guide was precise and extremely good with detailed instructions. The service was professional and safe. Gaudi was phenomenal. Hope to see it completed by 2026.",
          "This place will leave you in awe. Amazing inside and out- my husband and I were here first week of January ... basically no line which was awesome; ticket price was 24 each but well worth it. We didn\u2019t make it up to the top but decided to do this when it\u2019s expected to be finished in 2026.",
          "La Sagrada Familia is truly an evolving wonder! The engineering, the craftsmanship, the history - a multi-faceted design marvel. One really needs to spend good time to take it all in and see all the finer detail all around. There is a story \u2026",
          "I thought I had cathedral fatigue in Europe after seeing one grand and/or beautiful site after the next. And then there is La Familia Sagrada... Unique, stunningly grotesque masterpiece. Visited in 2008. Must revisit the cathedral at completion...",
          "This place is amazing. If you are reading this review, I can safely assume that you know that this building has a glorious history. It has so much to offer in terms of awe, experience and excitement that you need to be there to appreciate it",
          "We visited near sunset which was a real treat. The interior was lit by the setting sun and beautiful colors poured in through the windows. We also toured the bell tower on the Passion facade and stepped out onto the bridge as the bells tolled. It was frighteningly spectacular.",
          "If you are ever in Barcelona, the Sagrada Familia is a \"Must Do.\"  It is one of Antoni Gaud\u00ed's world renowned unfinished church.  It was started back in the late 1800's and even to this day it is still not finished.  The pictures really do \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning! We have been to Notre Dame and this one and  both are incredibly beautiful in their architecture but Sagrada is so impressive with its size and creativity. Not expensive either $29 each for basic tour",
          "MUST VISIT! Everything is very fast, even the line. At the entrance you will get an audio guide,which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to listen! Such an amazing history of the building! Iconic place!",
          "You are in Barcelona, so you're obviously going to visit the Sagrada. If you're smart, you already ordered the tickets online a few weeks before coming here, because that way you only paid 17 euros instead of the outrageous price they \u2026",
          "Very good but the surroundings are dirty, Barcelona need to pay street cleaners more",
          "An absolutely stunning church. The stained glass was amazingly gorgeous and cast beautiful colours all around the church. The recommendation is to go in the morning to see the light easter colours cast around the church, and in the \u2026",
          "**BOOK IN ADVANCE** we were lucky we were in Barcelona for 4 days but make sure you book either before you come to Barcelona or when you arrive to the city to make sure there is a time slot available, especially for the towers which was \u2026",
          "No words can describe the astounding feeling one experiences upon not only seeing but entering the church. It was designed by Gaudi, but he was unable to see its completion. In fact, the church is still under construction with an estimated \u2026",
          "It is very beautiful. As soon as you enter the main inside area the sheer scale is impressive. You would be clicking pictures left right and center. My suggestion is to just let it soak in for few minutes before you let your inner photographer go wild.",
          "There were only five stars or I would give it a hundred!!\nYou need time to really enjoy it.  Don't miss the details in the doors!\nOnce you finish you can still go around for any food.",
          "Had already been there but I love the place inside and outside. I got some bad experience with the security on the door because she didn't let me in 15 minutes before the hour of my ticket but let the people behind me get in with the same \u2026",
          "Stunning exterior and interior peace of art! It is one of the most visited place in Barcelona, so better to book the ticket on line to skip the line. Entrance is at the rear of the church and, exit is at the front. Be aware also of the \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning architectural and spiritual piece of work and art. Not particularly beautiful on the outside but absolutely stunning on the inside. The fact that it has been a work in progress for over 100 years is extra special as is the fact it should be finished by 2026. Will definitely be visiting it again by then.",
          "Unbelievable, stunning, awesome... This is not just a building but also a incredible place for worship and prayer. \n\nThe Catholic Mass is said really well, without rushing, meaning what they say... And in some cases multilingual... and \u2026",
          "Amazing, awe inspiring place to visit. Make sure you book your tickets in advance and use the official Sagrada Familia website for the best price. All tickets are timed so any other website that says this is a special feature is duping you. \u2026",
          "To see the inside with audio is a must.  This is like no other church or temple.  After 3PM sun enters stained glass for amazing effect.  Outside does not give an idea as to inside design.   A forest created in stone with very clean lines.  Variety of stone supports as needed to handle weight.",
          "Wow. Absolutely beautiful! Gaudi's architecture is something else. Fairly priced to get in (they have half price hours for people under 30 and seniors) and so worth it. Great place to take in architecture but if you are religious it is an amazing opportunity to pray in such a beautiful place of worship.",
          "Amazing architecture both the exterior of course but also the light filled spaces inside. Of course the crowds are a thing too but they seem to do a good job of managing the numbers. Overheard one woman complaining about the construction noise so I guess you can't please everyone!!",
          "Reserved the tower viewing months ahead of time and the day of our visit were told the towers weren't allowing anyone due to maintenance. We were very disappointed because we were told this the day of and we were told we would be getting a \u2026",
          "So great. Newer saw something familiar before)",
          "An outstanding monument of an architectural genius Antonio Gaudi. The light is absolutely marvellous, the columns are magnificent. A recommendation: take the audio guide and follow the instructions.",
          "This is a truly unique cathedral... Usually when you walk into cathedrals they are definitely jaw dropping, but also can be a bit dark/gothic/ominous feeling, but La Sagrada has a totally different, \"lighter\" feel because it looks like a \u2026",
          "It's beautiful!\nThe construction started decades ago and still going on. You can see different style of architecture in the different parts of the building.",
          "A must see when in Barcelona.. I would highly recommend doing the guided audio tour available. It offers such cool insight and really allows you to understand the history (and projected future) of this wonderful work of art.",
          "Amazing. The design and sheer size are just breathtaking. Definitely attend a mass if in Barcelona.",
          "Amazing building in Barcelona....Barcelona is a very beautiful city for a great time to see many hotspots...the city of Ghaudi...",
          "Amazing. It's a shame everything is paid including the yard but there is a nice park next to it with some benches. You can walk around a full circle and it's worth it to do so because Sagrada Familia is different all around. \nDon't miss to visit it even if you don't plan to get in.",
          "Beautiful place surrounded by nice restaurant and parties. One of Barcelona's main touristic attractions that is always under construction. If you want to find a variety of coffeeshops and restaurants, this is the place to be. It's also well communicated due to the facilities of public transportation, or even biking.",
          "It's the brightest church i have ever seen. It's simply beautiful and the entire building is like a picture with 1000 details. You can watch and watch and watch, and you'll find one more thing to discover every second.",
          "I have been to many cathedrals and religious structures in Europe but I was not prepared for the Majesty of the Sagrada Familia. Under construction for over a hundred years, this is perhaps the world's most poignant testament to man's \u2026",
          "Amazing place of worship and architectural masterpiece. Be aware that although online tickets are timed, you still need to stand in queue to get in (it took us about 20 mins) and the same to enter tower. On the day we were there, tickets for that day were sold out before 12pm so it might be worth buying them online in advance.",
          "Absolutely stunning! Most definitely worth the entry fee and walking around with the audioguide. Most definitively, hands down the most epic cathedral/basilica I've been in. The stained glass windows are mind blowing! Definitely get your butts in there!",
          "It's a place to leave you without words. All sides of the building are full of incredible details. Wonderful... You fill to cry, when you see this piece of art \ud83c\udfa8!",
          "YOU WILL BE MESMERIZED WHEN YOU GET TO SEE THIS GREAT HUMBLE BASILICA. IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU TO LIVE A MOMENT LIKE TODAY.",
          "Very unique space. Despite the strict timed ticket process, a great experience. The interior might be more spectacular than the famous facade. Not to be missed when in Barcelona.",
          "This is most likely one of the top reasons you came to Barcelona and the inside of this beautiful building will make it worth it. We went just before sunset to see the sun pierce directly through the west wall and it was beautiful. The \u2026",
          "I left the place at awe and in debt to city Barcelona for offering this marvel. Among so many Basilicas I have seen so far this one left an spectacular mark on my memory. Thank you Gaud\u00ed! The construction is projected to finish at 2026 but \u2026",
          "It's dream for me, always I was watching the photos of la Sagrada familia and talking to my self what the magical art this, on real is unbelievable and difficult to explain how was my feels",
          "MUST plan in advance to get the ticket if you are planning to visit this place in your trip.\nA very very nice church. Gaudi, the famous architect had put in a lot of effort and every single element has its meaning. I'm not a Christian but \u2026",
          "This place is simply beautiful. There's not much more to say. It's a stunning feat of architecture and something that everyone who visits Barcelona should stop in and see. It's the most intricate and ornate large building that I've ever \u2026",
          "Astonishing yet amazingly outrageous design and visuals. Love this cathedral and can't wait to go back again once finished. Highly recommend when visiting Barcelona.",
          "Must visit the church, the interiors are beautiful. Would recommend a guided tour to understand the depth of the intricate details. The tower can be very claustrophobic for some and may be closed during extreme wind or rain. It takes at \u2026",
          "This is the true masterpiece of Gaudi. It is really beautiful on the outside and on the inside it is marvelous where you have light flying around you and many sculptures. It is relatively cheap and if you want to get up to the towers you need to pay some extra.",
          "Incredible place to visit. The lighting is something else, and the way that the supporting columns have been made to look like a forest is really stunning. Highly recommend",
          "You come all the way and after seeing a big rush and que outside people just go away.\nWait have patience and take a look inside. It\u2019s one of the best.",
          "The church is amazing,  beautiful inside. We took a tour that explained the history about architects and their designing ideas odd the outside and the inside of the basilica.  Also had access to a tower that you go up in am elevator but coming down around 400 steps, kind of narrow and scary at times.  Overall, great experience!",
          "Beautiful architectural masterpiece with a ton of natural light. I love the style of the interiors because it doesn't look at all like your typical european church with creepy statues and dungeons looking crypts. I would definitely recommend booking in your ticket in advance, but I'm not sure about the audio guide.",
          "You can enjoy either outside or inside, either end of the building, either in the daytime or at night. Walking through the tower was no so good as expected, but the stained glasses, sculptures and pillars inside were so gorgeous.",
          "How incredible! How fantastic! \nThis is something so much unique and flawless and fabulous and magical and .. and .. Oh! No any words could explain that glorious place!",
          "This is one of the few attractions that I have found it quite beneficial to pay for the guided tours and/or audio tour. There is a wealth of information and details about the construction and design over the many decades. To start, you \u2026",
          "Magical and a must visit while in Barcelona, took the guided tour and it was a great experience, the guide showed and introduced many unique aspects of the building that you will not know if not because of her. The security checks can be improved though, the officer was going through my bag not in the best manner that one can expect.",
          "Beautiful. I wouldn't miss La Sagrada Familia. It's a must-see. Of course, if you're into culture and history. Make sure you read a bit before going because the history behind this place is amazing!",
          "This is the best church I've ever seen. Grapes over here, lizards and snakes over there~ Wheat or something crawling up the domes. You could stare at it for hours and notice something new. You won't find a tower that is exactly the same to \u2026",
          "A must see. Entrance procedures mimic an airport. I found the audio guide tough to follow. It wasn't easy to understand where to stand next. On the other hand it provides information to help understand the history and motivation behind the \u2026",
          "Great atmosphere and amazing architecture. Ques are horrendous but worth the wait. Local coffee shops and park are great to absorb the local attraction",
          "Breathtaking does not even come close. We spent 3.5 hours here, could have spent the whole day. Words alone cannot describe the beauty of this place.",
          "Was the most Holy Building I have ever entered, very hard to explain the atmosphere inside. Was harder to enter this building than to go through customs, but so worth the visit! You will never see another Holy place like this and the \u2026",
          "The best place n the most beautiful synagogues ever in the world. Spanish artists truly showed their live n details. Must go while visiting Barcelona. A bit expensive but no one should miss it. You should book 2 days in advance n online is much easier and a little cheaper.",
          "INCREDIBLE!!  If you only have time to see one site in Barcelona, La Sagrada Familia is it!  Get tickets to go inside as well, or you're missing out.  It's unlike anything you've ever seen before.  Just amazing!  The church itself is beyond \u2026",
          "Must see when in Barcelona. Book tickets online somewhere (there are many sites!) and go in the morning or late afternoon/evening - then you will better avoid the crowds! :) Great spiritual architecture...Towers were closed when I visited, \u2026",
          "Most beautiful architectural experience  in the world! Definitely purchase tickets in advance so u dont have to stand in line! Do the audio, so worth it! Stunning church..a MUST SEE in Barcelona!",
          "Words cannot explain the wonder of this work and imagination by Gaudi. This is a must see on things you must see while in Europe. Plan ahead, since many people go to this basilica, the lines are long, i recommend a good tour guide from a known company; worth paying a few more euros for such a fantastic place.",
          "One of the best church in the world. The tower tour is amazing walk. Kids below 6 years old can not join the tour. It is recommended to buy ticket online, cheaper also. The view is much better when the construction is finished.",
          "Outstanding Catholic building by one of the greatest architectural artist of the 20th Century. Although it's always visited by crowds of tourist from all around the world, it's definitely worth to visit if you come around Barcelona. Don't dare missing out it at all!!!",
          "A must! And you should buy the advance entrance ticket with audio guide! I\u2019m so happy that we did purchase the audio guide. It gave as lots of details and more understanding",
          "No. 1, If there any list of most attraction place in Barcelona.",
          "It is a mystery place. You can feel and touch the God there... this place is a masterpiece. Audio guide in polish is perfect. Worth every money!",
          "Sagrada Familia is impressive!  Was one of the main reasons for visiting Barcelona!  Definitely worth a visit.  This is a symbol of the city. Gaudi is buried in the crypt of the cathedral.  Let in certain hours.  The temple is planned to be completed by 2026.  Definitely number 1 in Barcelona.",
          "It is breathtaking! We went in the afternoon and the light through the windows that lit up the church was amazing. The audiotape gives good information. We didn't go the tower but I would have liked to see the close up view so if you can get the reservation it probably would be worth it.",
          "Whilst I absolutely appreciate the design and look of the building. My most prevalent thought was that I was watching the construction of a world famous building. Apparently they sink 25 million euros into this annually and you can see where its going. A must see.",
          "Gaud\u00ed's Architecture was so out of this world, modernism or organic architecture, does not matter. I'll love to see it completed... asking God to give me health to see it done, but with a burger in my hand :D",
          "The most stunning architecture and a grand project that deserves to be completed",
          "Initially skeptical about checking out this historical site. It was spectacular, breathtaking, and one of kind in the world. Photos don\u2019t begin to provide any justice. Must see in person!!",
          "Is a place that you must see with your own eyes. And you can only understand it when you see it, maybe. The gigantic doors entrance is just incredible",
          "Absolutely astounding structure. Bear in mind I didn\u2019t get go inside to take this review with a grain of salt although very few people are likely to be left underwhelmed with even the architecture from the outside, it\u2019s easy to be impressed \u2026",
          "One of the best things I've ever seen in my life. If you love architecture, Christianity, history, or all 3. It's a magical place!",
          "Absolutely must see if you're in Barcelona. Inside is not as breathtaking as outside, but it's still worth visiting.\nI recommend you to buy tickets online for the cheapest option which is 17 euro. It's good to do it week earlier, if you \u2026",
          "Architectural pilgrimage. Take your time and just take it all in. Words fall short of explaining what Mr Gaudi had in mind. Work in progress but one can understand why.. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day!",
          "Wow.  What an awesome place.  All the extravagance is on the outside.  Inside Gaudi kept it simple which really is beautiful.  The stained glass windows are incredible.",
          "Good God this place is amazing. You've seen cathedrals, you know what a basillica is, but until you've seen La Sagrada Familia your architectural experience is not complete. I've never seen a more intricate, beautiful piece of art I've ever seen. I would highly recommend going.",
          "The one place everybody has to visit in Barcelona. It's very crowded, but it's also very organized and everybody is friendly. We really didn't have to wait anywhere, but there are always many people around you. Go early or go late for the best lighting through the colorful windows.",
          "Amazing place; I could tell you not to judge a book by its cover. The outside of this enormous church can look stange, or maybe even scary for some, but the inside is completely different, a real poem for your senses, composed with space, light and faith in God and men.",
          "Is was amazing, if you have doubts of going inside believe me you won't regret it. For me that I've been in many many many religious places this is totally different! And I recommend the audio guide because it has a lot of important information.",
          "Great! Great! Great! So elegance! Have to visit it if you go to Barcelona!\nI suggest you to buy online tickets because you don't need to stay in line and also it's cheaper!",
          "I visited here while i was on my trip to spain, Barcelona. It was worth spending my time and money. Amazing work of an architect. I was started to be built years ago and construction still going on. Loved the scenic view from the top.",
          "If I could give it 10 stars I would. Go inside!!! Time your visit with the sun for a breathtaking religious experience. Never seen anything like it!!!",
          "This Church located in Barcelona, Spain is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a Roman Catholic Church planned by architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed and its construction began in 1882. However, it remains incomplete until today. This is mainly because \u2026",
          "I'll admit. It's impressive. I just found it to be too, um, rocky I guess? I guess just not my taste. I prefer something more traditional. Traditional can still be grand and magnificent. Still an impressive work of art with great symbolism.",
          "I would give a 6 or higher if I could. Simply amazing. One of the great wonders of the world. Cant wait to be back when its finished in 2026. Pictures cannot do it justice.",
          "Absolutely spectacular from the outside, couldn't get in as our tickets were cancelled due to a protest march and we didn't have time to reschedule. Really busy in the surrounding area. Definitely book in advance and yes we did get a refund.",
          "Most beautiful catholic church in the world devoted to the holy family of Christ. Very different from other catholic churches. The statues are outside rather than inside. The inside looks like a forest, with long pillars branching off like trees to support the roof and the towers. The stained glass windows are stunning.",
          "This church is fantastic. The facades are beautiful, but also the church inside is wonderful, with enormous columns and spectacular windows. Although the church isn't completed, it is one of the places to visit if you are in Barcelona.",
          "A contemporary artist's idea of a church built on a massive scale.  Some of the symbolism was easy to understand but some had to be explained to understand the religious significance. I'm more of a traditional church guy.  My last words on this building are \"visually rich\".",
          "One of the Amazing places I've ever seen. No words can describe the magnificence of this place, the interior takes your breath away. Absolutely a must to see.",
          "Beautiful new cathedral.  It is really neat to see the construction process ongoing. Take a guided tour.  It's totally worth the expense of you can afford it.  The added k knowledge and commentary is much better than an audioguide.",
          "Really beautiful! Must do a whole walk around the cathedral that way you see it's two sides which are completely different styles.",
          "A must see! The best Gaudi piece in my opinion. The weather was cloudy the day we visited but the color of the mosaic windows and the shades were still amazing. It is nothing like any other churches in the world. We did the tower on the nativity side and it was not that impressive",
          "Amazing, absolutely recommended, not similar to anything I\u2019ve seen in my life. The audio guide made everything even more fascinating. Going up the towers is not a must in my opinion but you can see a nice view.",
          "The work that they are doing is amazing. I've been there 10 years ago and in these years this building changed substantially. The external seems not far from completion and looks stunning. If you want to visit the internal remember to book \u2026",
          "Just visit it and you will understand. No need to pay for the tower, but get a audio guide. Really good English  audio guide.",
          "Impressive work and still in progress (should finish in 2026). You can't believe how Gaudi designed this church. We went up in one of the towers, to be honest I was expecting more to see from above. Don't forget to visit also the museum in the basement.",
          "Amazing building with a lot of fine funny and interesting detail. It is definitely worth to visit, tickets are not very expensive and it is on the bucket list of many travellers for a good reason. I did not like some parts of this modern style personally, but I am very glad that I could visit and see it in reality.",
          "There is good reason why this is a popular landmark.  Antoni Gaudi\u2019s genius is on full display.  Come to learn the story of how this Cathedral came into being and admire the many beautiful details.",
          "Stunning architecture! The audio tour was definitely worth it. It made me appreciate and understand the details and everything so much more. Seriously, so breathtaking! I can't wait to go back after it's finished!",
          "Amazing piece of architecture when it comes to original old part of cathedral. Consistency and mastering of the craftsman, sculptured beautifully... personally not of big fan of modern additions though, they just doesn't come together at \u2026",
          "An absolutely beautiful monument that makes you feel like you're looking at one of the wonders of the world. Gaudi has outdone himself by building this piece of art, it's a true achievement that's yet to be completed. An estimated 2026 \u2026",
          "Such a great piece of imagination, skill and art. Visited it today and happy with the decision of having an audio guide . It really helped in understanding the significance of intricate details on the walls/pillars which would seem vague from afar to someone at first sight.",
          "Unusual serene and ambitious...there's no other place quite like it. Come when the sun is shining if you can to see the full stained glass windows effect....expensive entry but you must be helping to finish construction!",
          "Wonderful building! The basilica was beautiful! Although still under construction, the basilica itself was as expected. The lines are long so book a ticket at least a week in advance. If you want to see a good view of the basilica, go to the nearby hotels with rooftop terraces.",
          "Beautiful and amazing architecture with an impressive view. If your in Spain I would recommend you coming by here for this beauty. Wish I was able to go inside, next time for sure.",
          "The large unfinished Catholic cathedral is very traditional on the inside. The most interesting and beautiful parts are on the outside. I strongly recommend to get a guide (person or book) that can help you see and understand the building \u2026",
          "This the most beautiful and most imaginative church in the world. Breathtaking and may even evoke tears or at the very least, a welling up of emotion. You MUST make time for this if you\u2019re going to be in Barcelona!",
          "This place is, in a word, breathtaking!  The audio tour is worth it if you want to get a more detailed description of the different areas.  As soon as you get in and look up you are overcome by the sheer magnitude of imagination and \u2026",
          "I bought my ticket online and had no problem getting in. I would recommend the audio tour. Also you get to pick between going up to one of the 2 towers. I recommend the tower of the Nativity. Every one seems to pick the passion tower \u2026",
          "Fantastic, impressively different. A must go for sure. Will go again when it is finished. It is usualy a very busy place, so buy tickets in advance.",
          "Stunning! It leaves you out of breath. I recommend paying for the auto guide and of you can pay to visit a tower. This experience is unique",
          "Absolutely fantastic. The inside is simply breathtaking. We weren't able to access the towers we had booked due to strong winds, however that portion of our ticket price was refunded, and to be honest this could've been a good thing since it allowed for more time to admire the inside.",
          "This is the most impressive church I\u2019ve been to. Although still in construction phase both the exterior and interior will blow your mind. \n\nIt\u2019s best to buy your tickets online and have them on your phone. Saves having to wait in line. \u2026",
          "The one place you should definitely visit when in Barcelona. The audio guide was really informative and helpful. We booked through internet and we had zero waiting time.",
          "Worth the visit.  The audio tour was a bit confusing at times, but generally good once you sorted out where you need to stand for the given track.  I am looking forward to seeing the Basilica once it is complete in 2026.",
          "One of the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever been. The colours take your breathe away and even amongst the hustle and bustle of thousands of visitors it\u2019s very quiet and serene in places inside.",
          "Words may not be enough to describe the beauty of this church. It is a must visit place if you are visiting Barcelona, and you will definitely be stunned with the architectural beauty. Always book tickets in advance, I would suggest to take with audio guide so you can know about Gaudy's idea behind the architecture.",
          "Magnificent even if you have seen many cathedrals.  Walk inside, ignore the crowds around you and let yourself be absorbed by the space.  It is truly universal.  As with all the well known sites the exit is always through the gift shop.",
          "If you wish to be in awe of science and art and inspiration from the nature, this place will seriously bewilder you and make you wonder the depths to which Gaudi had thought and planned the entire architecture. \n\nYou will be in awe when the \u2026",
          "Impressive. Buy tickets days/weeks in advance otherwise you will not get in",
          "Started in 1880 now scheduled to be done in 2026. It\u2019s Gaudi\u2019s masterpiece. Come in the afternoon to get the amazing light through the glass windows, and if you can schedule it for near the winter solstice when the light is at its lowest, \u2026",
          "Very lovely place! Very enormous building, and also beautiful! If you have time and money, this is your best bet.",
          "Truly incredible experience. We bought our tickets online, staff was very friendly, and the entire visit was breathtaking. So much to see. Definitely plan on visiting again.",
          "Buy tickets online. If you're trying to go in that is. It's more impressive on the outside than it is on the inside honestly. On the inside you will see lots of people sitting down/milling around because there simply is not a lot to see. \u2026",
          "Awesomeness.  It's practically indescribable.  The first time I saw it, I was practically underneath it.  The outside is well-photographed, but the inside is even more amazing.  Especially, the stained glass illuminates the inside differently depending upon the season and tlme of day.",
          "La Sagrada Familia is a must see when visiting Barcelona! It's a beautiful Cathedral and words and photos don't do it justice. It can be viewed from all sides and the neighborhood is dedicated to it as a focal point of interest and worship. \u2026",
          "This is my favorite church. It is fantastic both from the inside and from the outside. Gaud\u00ed left some instructions on how to finish it, but there has been some improvisation as well. The colors through the vitals are amazing. The geometric shapes are mesmerizing.",
          "It\u2019s fascinating. It is so huge to  check out everything! Everything has meaning and behind. You should definitely get an audio guide. I love it",
          "Very unique construction. If you see in detail small small parts are jointed very carefully. Daily lots of people visiting it.",
          "Amazing cathedral. The architecture here is one of Gaudis most famous and it really doesn't disappoint. As you might know, Gaudi bases his work on the original architect, nature. If you can get a guided tour, then you'll really appreciate \u2026",
          "Great historical landmark and definitely worth a visit. For tickets and audio guide try to book it online as it will be slightly cheaper. Visiting the towers is also possible but the waiting times are slightly higher. And if it is a sunny day inside the the colours are awesome.",
          "I was expecting this to be quite unpleasantly touristy but I was blown away by the beauty of the building. Our guide was very knowledgeable which really helped. Definitely worth a visit and we will definitely be visiting Barcelona again!",
          "Visually...different to say the least. Its a love or hate thing for sure. Im in awe of the scope of the building and construction for sure but its more on an eyesore than anything. Still as with all good art and architecture it should be \u2026",
          "Not my sort of thing to go and see but I got told by many people i had to go have a look. And jeez I am glad I did. It was amazing. Absoulty enormous. And just amazing to see.",
          "Tl;dr take the time to explore this building. You\u2019ll be glad you did. Take a tour or walk around yourself, but make sure to stop by at least once. \n\nI\u2019m not religious, but this made me feel a sense of awe nonetheless. The detailing of each \u2026",
          "When in Barcelona, it's a must! I recommend not only seeing it from outside, but paying the ticket to enter. Price is a bit steep but it's worth it. I was amazed by Gaud\u00ed and by everything of this building. Don't forget to enter the museum \u2026",
          "Breathtaking cathedral! One of the most impressive basilica I ever visited. Anyone in Barcelona absolutely must visit the place.",
          "Awesome.  The only thing is they have to be really clear with people before go up the elevator because I almost dead when I go down cause u have panic attacks going down stairs on foot from so height . I went downn in my buttocks because of \u2026",
          "Amazing and must seen if you visit Barcelona. An incredible and massive church",
          "So beautiful castle in Spain even it still in construction. Recommend for all the person who able to walk to go up to the top of the castle not recommend for a person who need accessible because they do not have life on there when you have to come down.",
          "It's beautiful, best of the architecture combination of art work and colours...they are renovating it. So i got to see both versions of the church. One face which is centuries old and one which is brand new. U get to live in two worlds at same place and time. Must visit",
          "Just loved it, one of the best ( certainly from top 2) basilicas I have seen. The amount of thought and work that is put into Sagrada is tremendous. One needs to see it to believe it. Will visit again once all towers are complete in 2022.",
          "Impressive architecture. The shops in front are very convenient. Food in the surrounding area is good but look out for frozen paella, not the same as fresh paella which can be found closer to the beach",
          "It\u2019s a must see when in Barcelona. Even though it has been in construction for at least last 8 years and since I last visited the cranes are still in the landscape. The place is crowded but there is a nice park behind it to relax and with some flying wild parrots. Very enjoyable visit as usual.",
          "Breath taking serious u have to see it if your going to Barcelona! I love little hidden treasures off the beaten track so when I was told about it I kinda shrugged it off but I went anyway and omg the most beautiful building I've ever seen in my life the creative thinking that has gone into it is truly amazing!!!",
          "Just staying outside and looking at this magnificent structure is jaw dropping! What more when you go inside. Details are everywhere! Make sure to get a guide to properly explain this one of a kind structure. A must go when in Barcelona, Gaudi's unfinished work continues to amaze people from all over the world",
          "Totally worth seeing. The detail of this church is like nothing I'd ever seen. On the outside there are figures carved into the building...amazing detail. You could spend 30+ minutes in the same spot admiring the craftsmanship/art. A lot of \u2026",
          "One place near las ramblas, this awesome historical place. Hope get chance to visit back and make vlog on my youtube chanel.",
          "Quite a beautiful structure inside and out.  Everywhere you look there are large details hiding dozens of smaller ones.  The scale is simply amazing too.  Everything about it just seems so overwhelmingly detailed that you wonder how one man conceived it all; you do understand why it is still under construction though.",
          "One of the popular tourist attractions.. still under construction.. Christmas markets around were too good.. very close to metro station.. lively place.. beware of pickpockets while commuting in metro..",
          "Be sure to get tickets in advance or it maybe sold out. There is however a tour guide company across the street that will have tickets and tours for a higher price... Worth every penny to see!",
          "Always a delight to see this magnificent structure. A truly must see if you are in Barcelona! Still in contribution obviously and can\u2019t wait to see the final completion in 2026.",
          "It is an outstanding marvelous architecture. However it is annoying the quantity of people who are always around.\nExpensive \u20ac\u20ac to see it inside with a long lines to enter.",
          "I was pleased with the  audio tour as it gives you all the information needed on your own terms. I could still  go back over some points.  Passion towers tour reveals   a splendid view over the city and the experience of getting down a thousand narrow steps down back to  the cathedral. If you are fan of Gaudi, it's a must.",
          "Excellent view from each tower!  Worth to spend more time for \"slow\" tour! Despite the crowd remains its atmosphere. Still under construction, architecture still in motion. Valuable mariage of artistic view with new archtectural technology..",
          "This place is simply amazing! An absolute must-see! Book your slot to visit the towers online well in advance and avoid the huge queues!",
          "Amazing the one place you definitely don't want to miss when you're in Barcelona. The details inside are mind blowing.",
          "Great experience. The detail is amazing. Don't miss out on exploring this soon to be world wonder.",
          "This magnificent edifice deserves six or even seven stars! An incredible feat of architecture and design.\n\nOn a sunny winter afternoon the light floods through the stained glass windows of the southwest-facing Passion Facade, drenching the interior in colour.",
          "If you don't like cathedrals you should still consider going here. This is a unique experience. Religious at a different level.",
          "When in Barcelona you must make time to visit La Sagrada Familia. This is probably Gaudi\u2019s most famous works and the work is not yet done. It will be still many more years before it\u2019s completed. \n\nBuy tickets online to make it easy. Audio \u2026",
          "A masterpiece. Must visit if you're in Barcelona. Of you have to see 1 thing, it Should be the Sagrada Familia. Highly recommend getting an audio guide.",
          "The building is very beautiful. I was even more impressed when I went inside. We took the guided tour which was cheaper than the audio tour. It was very interesting. I am excited when the construction is complete in a few years.",
          "Just goosebumps! A place where your eyes will see beauty and your heart will feel blessed\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc99 Amazing place! \nTake note: there is always thousands of people visiting Sagrada Familia, so book your ticket on line, the previous day!",
          "Interesting story. Very impressive from inside",
          "Do I need to put a review for a sight that already has over a lakh reviews? Yes I do! This Basilica is truly an experience like no other cathedral in the world. Must visit and a bucket list item.",
          "No picture can describe the grandeur of the structure. I was pretty sceptical after all the chapel tours, but this one turned out to be my favorite. \nSomehow it feels like I'm in an alien structure. Again, you need to see it with your own eyes",
          "Get your tickets online beforehand to avoid queues. Unfortunately, tickets that cover passion towers are always in demand and have to be booked much earlier. I\u2019ve also enjoyed a free light and sound show hosted around Christmas.",
          "Worth every penny. It\u2019s magnificence like no other. I recommend spending at least an hour and half to see the lower part of the church. I didn\u2019t take a tour of the towers, but if you can, do it!",
          "The Most spiritual place I've ever visited. Just happen to be in one of the most beautiful city in the world. \n!I love it!",
          "Absolutely gorgeous testiment to Gaud\u00eds architecture. Certainly a lot more impressive from the outside than in, but will be revisiting when it is finished, and I fully expect it to be absolutely breathtaking. \n\nSecurity getting in is phenomenal, and is great to see, but can be slightly overwhelming. All in all, spectacular place.",
          "One of the most spectacular things I've ever seen with my own 2 eyes! I would highly recommend the audio guide as its possibly one of the most informative audio guides I've used and even had me replaying certain parts to be able to take it \u2026",
          "Barcelona is the most beautiful understated city with a beautiful chilled out people. La Sagrada really is mesmerising to be totally truthful. For me it's the best tourist attraction in Europe. Nothing in Paris or London comes even close.",
          "The church was amazing! The architecture and history of the church was interesting. It is a major tourist attraction. Must see. Buy tickets early or online. Sells out quick.",
          "What a magnificent cathedral.  Since 1880, Antoni Gaudi set out to design and construct a new church for Barcelona and to this day it is still under construction.  They are not exactly sure as to the completion date exactly.  It\u2019s so \u2026",
          "Incredible place well worth the visit! Spanish culture and Barcelona specifically is a gem! I love Spain",
          "The most majestic church I have ever visited in my entire life.  The breath-taking array of colors inside and its intricate exterior will captivate me forever.  You cannot visit Barcelona without visiting Gaudi's church, so make sure it is \u2026",
          "Buy tickets online and expect to go through security when you get there. Get the guided tour it's so informative and there is a lot to learn about this beautiful cathedral. Make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy and take in everything \u2026",
          "Planning for visiting to Barcelona? Then know that visiting Sagrada costs \u20ac20-\u20ac30.\nIf you are searching for answer if that amount is worth it?\nElse you are looking at it after reading Dan Browne.. Read on..\nFirst thing to answer is it worth \u2026",
          "A cathedral like no other. Unusual and beautiful structure, well worth the $24 (20 Euro) admission price. Online reservation a must, as they sell out every day. Online res includes audio guide, which is very good intro--explains many features that would be overlooked otherwise. Highly recommended.",
          "This is hands down the most beautiful building I have ever seen. We bought tickets with an audio guide and access to the Nativity facade. The audio guide is definitely recommended since you'll get to hear about the entire process and see \u2026",
          "Absolutely gorgeous! Photos do not do it justice. If you go I would definitely recommend getting the audio tour. It's very informative.  Would love to see it once it's finished.",
          "This place is even more spectacular in person. I feel like no pictures online does this place any justice. You MUST see it in person. Such a magical site to see",
          "Construction of the Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Familia at Carrer de Mallorca, 401, 08013 Barcelona, Spain. commenced in 1882, then shortly after in 1883 Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi took over the project as chief architect. Gaudi \u2026",
          "Unbelievable and just amazing.  Watching this as the sunsets is just awesome.  Walked around the park and also there a nice coffee spots around to chill and soak the views.",
          "Absolutely stunning, we opted for the audio guide option and were not at all disappointed. This is a definitely my favorite part of Barcelona.",
          "Outstanding views, beautifully made. They keep working on it but 'my god its perfect'. Enjoy",
          "Gaud\u00ed was a genius! And this is the proof. This place is amazing! Its architecture perfectly tells you stories and everything fits just perfect on its place.",
          "A must see attraction in Barcelona. Stuffed we with details and many interesting displays. Prebook tickets in order to be sure to get in.",
          "Started in 1882 and planned to be finished in 2026, the 100 year anniversary of designer Gaud\u00ed\u2019s death, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is unlike any Basilica in Europe.  It\u2019s truly magnificent as Cathedrals go.  The colors coming through the stained \u2026",
          "Hands down the best stop in Barcelona. Be sure to purchase the towers tour. We enjoyed the Passion facade tower!",
          "It's a beautiful and spiritual place. It's inexpensive. It is a must do if you are visiting Barcelona. It is easy to get to from the train, bus, and taxi. It is highly informative place.",
          "Absolutely incredible experience. The architecture both inside and outside is well beyond expectations. Highly recommend the audio tour to give you a deeper understanding of the purpose of each part of the design and of Gaudi himself.",
          "Iconic building. Worth to visit - especially on sunny day (coloured glass is giving incredible visual effects).  The only problem are crowds.",
          "The outside was detailed and beautiful, but I thought \"20 Euros worth it? No.\" Even though the Nativity and the Passion sides so starkly contrasted each other - baroque and modern. It really is stunning. But the inside of the temple blew me \u2026",
          "Great place to see. Very helpful advice if you are not rich: buy the most basic ticket. The towers are a tourist trap ( 7 euro for nothing, almost no views at 2020). Most of the people will appriciate the place without the audio tour.",
          "incredibly beautiful, toda una obra de arte. \nIn construction for over 2 centuries.\n\nThe Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, also known as the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, is a large unfinished Roman Catholic minor basilica in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. \u2026",
          "No photo can do justice to this awe inspiring creative masterpiece. The level of detail - both internally and externally - is difficult to comprehend. Take your time. The longer you look, the more you see. Look in every direction, including \u2026",
          "My tot enjoyed it more than us. He was so happy to see the beautiful windows and the colors! He kept dancing and singing :)",
          "Make sure to pay and go inside. You'll need to book it a day or so in advance but it's worth it. The afternoons are really good with the light through the stained glass. If you get to go up to the tower stay and watch the sunset over the city. Well worth it.",
          "May be I just expect more, but to be honest it is incredible. When I said More I mean bigger, so no matter, it is wonderfull. Architecture is incredible, I really can't imagine how it is possible someone to have this imagination and create \u2026",
          "This is probably the best place I visited during my holiday in Barcelona. The church is huge and  different from any other in the world. The ticket can be a bit expensive, but it is completely justified! I suggest to buy tickets online...",
          "A must in Barcelona, beautiful landmark. the ticket is totally worthy, but book them in advance online; there are days when tickets sell out even at the ticket booth of the church. If you want to visit the towers I suggest checking \u2026",
          "Absolutely breathtaking. I have never felt so connected to god in all my life and I was unsure of my beliefs. You walk in for the first time. My jaw dropped and spent most of tour wide open.",
          "DO THIS TOUR!! Don\u2019t just look at it outside. It was even more breathing taking up close with so much detail. It\u2019s incredible. Going inside was amazing and made you feel so small and insignificant. The creativity of this place was out of this world. DO THIS TOUR!!!",
          "Amazing and must see monument of Barcelona. Better to come in morning or sunset hours to take better pictures of Gaudi facade.",
          "Wonderful. Beautiful. Like a trove of jewels. I imagined this is how God perceives our soul, bright with colors from the joy of living in His light. \u2661",
          "Good place to visit. The audio guide helps a lot and explains how Gaud\u00ed thought to build this amazing place. If you are at Barcelona this place is absolutely recommended.",
          "Yes  a MUST see inside and outside. Get a guided tour, but go see it at least a half hour prior, by yourself to get the scope and magnitude. The stained glass windows cast amazing retractions on the inside on a sunny day.",
          "Amazing basilica in Barcelona. If you want to go inside though,  I highly recommend buying your tickets online on their website prior to your visit. Crowds get insane. Lots of tourist groups too. However, it's still all worth it. The \u2026",
          "Once again this building blows my mind as I sit back and marvel at the incredible potential of the human being. Architecture at its finest. This structure is very big, way bigger than I thought. It's hard to capture a photo even from a wide \u2026",
          "Such magnificent Architecture! It\u2019s beauty is just mesmerizing to the eye. The only downside is the construction which is forever going.",
          "Breathtaking,  a must see. \nThe outside is incredible enough,  but if you decide to go inside, buy your tickets in advance. It's a bit hectic trying to purchase tickets in person.",
          "One of the wonders of modern architecture, this is easily the best place to visit in Barcelona. Use of natural light, filtering through specially designed panes, transforms the interior to a dream place. Take guided tour  to appreciate the beauty of details.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral. The unique architecture of Gaudi allows light to flow in from huge windows, that are stained in different colours. The spectacular outside sculptures tell the biblical stories rather than having them on display inside. It's definitely well worth a visit.",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I have ever visited. I advise you go there at sundown as the light inside is gorgeous at that time of day.",
          "Breathtaking. Get your tickets way in advance. Try to go during \"golden hour\" when the sun sets through the stained glass windows. Beautiful.",
          "A monument of the geniality that Gaudi had. It's hard to describe in words what you can see and feel.",
          "Gaudi's whimsical take on architecture in synchrony with nature is a sight to behold. Beautifully lit, softly coloured on the inside, with the different facades depicting different colours in tune with the different times of day. The image \u2026",
          "Wonderful cathedral. Started in 18th century. It is due to be completed by 2026. A must visit place in Barcelona.",
          "\"The Holy Family\" is absolutely gorgeous. I just cannot emphasize how unique and beautiful it is. It truly leaves you out of breath and your jaw hanging when your see its details. A beautiful piece of art",
          "Definitely a must visit, both inside and outside. Buy the tickets in advance to skip the queue. Includes an audio-guide and a visit to one of the two towers.",
          "A truly epic church, it is famous around the world for good reason. Be sure to get tickets early and beforehand, like several days in advance.",
          "This was one of the highlights of my trip to Barcelona.  We went in the late afternoon.  The stained glass was brilliant with the light from the setting sun. Be sure to book your tickets in advance to avoid the lines.  Also get a ticket \u2026",
          "Beautiful place which is truly awe inspiring. I was impressed with how much theological thought went into each and every aspect of the church.",
          "a little bit pricey but that has been the trend with all of the gaudi buildings in barcelona. the structure itself though is nothing like you have seen before it is gorgeous and unique in every way. if you're going to choose one building to see i recommend this one",
          "No words how to describe this architectural piece of art. Still unfinished, but amazing. Will not be missed if you are visiting Barcelona",
          "Amazing architecture, kept thinking I would see a Disney World sign somewhere, certainly the entrance charge was on par for DW Europe! A very clever tourist magnate that is likely to outlive it's original purpose!",
          "I never saw a church like this. It is completely different from an old church. All the things to admire are outside on the facade and the inside of the church is simple and beautiful. The inside is a mix between simplicity and greatness. \u2026",
          "When we were there it was really busy and to be honest i think its like that most of he year. It was really difficult to walk around aswell as there was construction work going on. Taking a picture without getting other people in was really difficult. The artwork is grand and connects nicely with the city.",
          "Absolutely without a doubt the most incredible space I've ever been in. The integration of natural shape, Christian symbolism and stunning stained glass is mesmerizing. If I could live here I would move in yesterday.",
          "Enormous cathedral. In the last few years, can see a big progress in building saga. Probably will be finished in the 2026.\nNice to get in, but better to stay outside in the small park situated near the cathedral.",
          "Great Basilica to visit but about the tower view.. I don\u2019t know what to say.. I don\u2019t think is worth it.. very tight place and very fast",
          "Magnificent architectural work! Couldn\u2019t believe that\u2019s it hasn\u2019t ever been fully completed! Highly recommend stopping even for a quick second to take it all in!",
          "Although this place is always crowded, it\u2019s always worth it to go and experience Gaudi\u2019s creative genius on full display. I highly recommend getting the audio guide to really  understand what is the meaning/purpose of each section in this \u2026",
          "One of the best things I've seen in my life thus far...absolutely amazing and leaves you speechless. A magnificent piece of history and architectural design that started in 1826 and is still being built today...Just wow.",
          "I finally understood what it means to have your breath taken away after seeing one of the 7 wonders of the world. Very honestly I tell you that for the first few seconds or so, you will be speechless. We were too.",
          "What an amazing church. Lots of detail and story telling from the architecture on the outside. Once inside beautiful light rays coming in through the stain glassed windows. Great history to visit",
          "This place is just incredible. It makes you breath faster, when you are inside. \nP.s. Audio guide isn\u2019t so obvious sometimes",
          "Was it worth it paying that 20 -40 odd euro to enter a cathedral? Yes yes and a hundred times yes. I am not a big fan of Churches and generally practices atheism but the wonder and majesty of this cathedral will blow you away. It is not \u2026",
          "Words cannot describe what an incredible place this is. A true Monument to God and to art and architecture at its finest!",
          "La Sagrada Familia is a church that it has yet to be completed. It's supposed to be finished by 2026. The tickets are best to be purchased via their site as you won't wait in lines and are cheaper (recommended with audio guide) but \u2026",
          "Really  worth paying  the administration  fee to enter, the outside  of the building  does no justice  to the inside, the most unique  building  I have ever entered . Highly  recommend  going  inside, boggles the mind. Not many tourist \u2026",
          "It's so beautiful. I love Gothic architecture, this is one of the best buildings in this style.  Must be visited while in Barcelona.",
          "Must visit place in Barcelona. Beautiful inside and out.",
          "This place is unreal! One of the coolest sights to see in Barcelona! Take the self guided audio tour and go at your own pace. I can't wait to return here when it's complete!",
          "Outstanding Cathedral, The Masterpiece!\nThe spot you must see in Barcelona!\nYou need to take the Audio guide ticket \u201d25\u20ac\u201d \nTelling you the history of the cathedral and so many facts! It's a good 2 hours around and inside the cathedral!\nVery well organised!",
          "Absolutely a must see in Barcelona. The exterior is extravagant with several major Biblical scenes sculpted into it and many important Christian symbols. Personally I would forego entry as the interior is not as interesting, in my opinion.",
          "If you understand Catholic Theology, you will have a deep understanding of what Gaudi was communicating in the architecture. Even if you have little to know understanding of The Catholic Faith, the building serves as a great tool to \u2026",
          "Got a fast track pass, got in easily. Spent about 2 hours there. Worth the time and effort. Love the building.",
          "Such a beautiful place, a MUST see in Barcelona. Be sure to get tickets in advance! They have Mass underneath in a small chapel as well if you plan your visit for the right time.",
          "Best ever glass art! Truly stunning!",
          "Visiting la Sagrada Familia was a unique experience. At first I was confused when I saw exterior of it. But when I got audio guide everything was explained and I understood perfectly why it's definitely a master piece. Unlike other \u2026",
          "Beautiful place with a lifetime of history involved. It was a lifetime and more for Gaudi himself. Our guide Amaia was great. Very informative and answered all questions. Lovely to get the talk on how it originated and what the history of the statues and ornate decoration meant.",
          "Happy to contribute to the construction of this great church. Such a joy to see the incredible architecture, and really great audio media included with the ticket.\n\nWe had tickets for the Passion tower but on the day-of we were told entry \u2026",
          "Excellent with a tour guide. I went though Julia Travel tours and the tour guide Viggo was very knowledgeable about the history and small details that would be missed in the architecture had you only done the audio guide. \nIf you're really into architecture and/or world religion history, this is a must see in Barcelona.",
          "Details, details, and details! Absolutely gorgeous! Definitely a must-see for every single person, regardless of religious beliefs and/or preferences. Tickets are not cheap, specially because the work is still in progress, however it is an important sponsor for such amazing church!",
          "Buy the day pass at least 48 hours ahead of time! Worth it! And assures your entrance!! So beautiful!",
          "Wonderful architecture. I would recommend to buy tickets online and be at the entrance at the specified time and you will not have to wait. It would be great to buy tickets with tower visit included and I would recommend the Nativity \u2026",
          "I would recommend to visit the Sagrada Familia in particular time of the day because if you find the perfect position of the sun then you will see the colorful lights of the windows creating a beautiful image.",
          "One of the most fantastic experiences of my life! Being inside the sharada familia is a unique experience I recommend it to everyone! Don\u2019t miss out if you\u2019re in Barcelona!",
          "Very impressive and beautiful. But make sure you buy tickets in advance. If you just come on site without having reserved anything, tickets might have been sold out. And that would be a shame because La Sagrada Familia is the one thing to see in Barcelona.",
          "One of those wonders of the world. A true masterpiece still in the making. Was great to visit with a guide explaining all the curious facts about the cathedral and the mastermind behind it.",
          "Stunning you have to see it to believe it. Advice is book online day before, doing it on the day is almost impossible as there is no physical ticket office and the local network can't handle everyone trying to book on there mobiles",
          "This cathedral - designed by Antonio Gaudi - is an ongoing labour of love in the centre of the city of Barcelona. It is, and should be, a very attractive and worthwhile place to visit. Often. Barcelona is one of my all time favourite cities \u2026",
          "One of the most awesome church in Europe. Architectural masterpiece from Gaudi. Definitely a most see at Barcelona.",
          "Fantastic attraction especially if you like architecture and history! Plan to buy tickets in advance as it is very busy, they can easily be bought online. Website says there is a dress code since it is a catholic church but no one enforces it.",
          "I spent 4.5 hours here. Get the audio tour. Everything was so well thought out that I was moved to tears!",
          "The view from the garden nearby with the lake is breathtaking. The stained glass windows light up the inside beautifully too. Must not miss it if you're in Barcelona!",
          "Great experience, even though I only had 45 minutes there before they closed. Wasn't mentioned that they were closing within 45 minutes of buying tickets. Outside of that, this place is a 5! Gorgeous experience and very informative.",
          "Worth every penny. A lot of people everywhere, so it is better to buy tickets on line",
          "Incredible place. The must-see of Barcelona. Inside is even more awesome than outside, it's a unique church, different from any other church in the world!",
          "Amazing but let down by the fact that it will cost at least 30 Euros for the visit with audioguide and didn't get to visit the towers because of \"wind\"...\n\nStill architecture is something you have to see to believe, watching the building \u2026",
          "Wow.. what construction... It's just amazing and huge. You must visit this place to understand more about the history...",
          "Absolutely fantastic! Well worth the money and is breath taking. Don\u2019t queue as you\u2019ll be lucky to get in, really busy queues, but pre-book online and get a ticket.  Once inside it doesn\u2019t feel half as busy and you\u2019re free to wander at your leisure.\n\nSeriously recommend visiting this place.",
          "Wonderfully crafted church. The architecture of this basilica is amazing, perfecto. When you look at it from the outside, you will have this feeling of looking at a full-of-history building, but when you step inside this building, that feeling will suddenly vanish. You will see how Antoni Gaudi can think steps ahead his generation.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking monument! Larger than life, ultimate piece of great architecture, dream project of Ar. Antoni Gaudi! Can't believe it took 150 years and yet to complete in 2026!! Wow, what a visionary!!!",
          "\"Lets go have a tour round a cathedral\" was what my partner suggested - i wasnt keen!!! But WOW what an experience!! Definitely worth the time to take the tour and understand the story and history of this place.... amazing!",
          "Breathtaking Gaudi building. The photos don't do it justice. The tour was on a phone and easy to use. We went in November and it was a bit crowded. Apparently not as busy as in the summer or early fall. We bought tickets to go up one of the \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture marvel that is unparalleled with anything I have seen in the past. The extravagant designs! The attention to details, the magnificent sculptures! Too bad it is a church so it does have that stench of religion. Went up \u2026",
          "This is one of the most impressive bulging I ever saw. Beautiful and very interesting. If you are in Barcelona is a must to see",
          "Not worth the hype. And the surrounding area is horrible, one fast food store after an other! Show some respect to a place like that and dont treat it like a rundown version of Disneyland",
          "Bought tickets before online directly from the site and it ended up being worth it. Both towers were closed when we went and they automatically refunded us because we bought directly through them. We did the audio guide and loved it. Magical place! Pictures do not do it justice",
          "I've never seen anything like it in my life ! Sometimes what mankind can do with hands is breathtaking , this is one of those times ! Que bonito!",
          "Breathtaking ! Incredible building that defies belief because of it's sheer scale & that period from which building was begun. \n*Beware ! If you have children though it's hard to find a toilet ! \nWe only found a very smelly dark & \u2026",
          "You have to see this. Its beautiful. And wen you go by the metro. There is a direct stop (Sagrada de Familia)",
          "What a masterpiece! enjoyed my guided tour thoroughly. Best to book ticket online as its cheaper and quicker. Will definitely comeback in future",
          "Beautiful place and many different views are there. Recommended for all type of travelers. They have group entrance separately and solo entrance in other side. Many souvenir shops are around the church and even you can find McDonald's, KFC, \u2026",
          "Fantastic place! Not only a touristic must-see and an architectural feast, but also a wonderful experience. Shouldn't be missed. I'd recommend taking the audio guide, but also walk around without one first.",
          "It's beautiful and obviously iconic, have not been inside so cannot comment on that but there is so much to see outside I dont feel short changed.  I would say 3 negatives though.  Loads of people there all the time so it's hard to savour \u2026",
          "This review needs 100 stars, not 5. Go inside. Climb a tower. Being inside this space will bring tears to your eyes, even if churches and religion mean nothing to you. Gaudi is king!",
          "What an incredible, wondrous, amazing building of architecture, labour and love.The  stained glass windows throw out splashes of rainbow colours over the interior throughout the day.\nI purchased tickets before I left NZ as I had heard there \u2026",
          "Visiting the Sagrada Familia has been on my bucket list for a long time, and it's safe to say it doesn't disappoint. Its imposing spires and facades tower of the nearby building and Barcelona skyline. \nThe queues to get into the site are \u2026",
          "Amazing landmark. We did the guided tour & learned a lot. Guides accent made her a little difficult to follow but once we got used to it we were fine.  A must do when in Barcelona.",
          "It's Barcelona. You've got to go. Allow time for the security checks. Guided tour well worth the extra couple of euros to have things pointed out in this massive building then have a wander. Go on a sunny day for the lighting through the windows.",
          "This place is one of must visit in Barcelona. I could not get inside due to Catalan protest and very tight itinerary next day, however this church is worth seeing even from outside after darkness as well. The area is plenty of people so you \u2026",
          "It's a really huge building with great architecture.  It's very beautiful   but the entrance fees is 30\u20ac if you want to buy it on the spot and we found it to costly for one person. Except church with glass and architecture designs there is nothing worth here to spend 30\u20ac as entrance fee.  Think twice before buying a ticket",
          "I've been fortunate to have toured La Sagrada Familia two different times with about 13 years between visits.  Both times I was completely amazed by the structure and how it continues to evolve.  I'd suggest setting aside a good chunk of time to take in all the details.",
          "It was breath taking seeing the old and the new, they are hoping to have finished the build in 2026. Well worth seeing. Thought a little expensive to get in !!!",
          "The best tourist attraction in all of Barcelona. My jaw was on the floor the entire time we walked in and around it. Our AirBnb was actually right across the street from the La Sagrada Familia so my wife and I were lucky enough to stare at it every day. If I could, I\u2019d definitely go back when the construction is complete.",
          "Simply breathtaking. Impossible to describe or capture in photos. Hands down the most extraordinary building I have ever entered. Very special place. Make sure you have enough time to do the museum below and wander through the school building. Just wonderful!",
          "This is a dazzling piece of work! Astonishing build and incredible detail! Every supporting column, every window, every tower and every front, every diferente material has a story and a reason to be, it is just magnificent to watch but if \u2026",
          "I love the Sagrada Familia. I have been a few times over the years, and even though I should know what to expect at this point, it's always a fresh, extraordinary experience. Because it's still being built, it's a space in flux. Inside, it \u2026",
          "This is a world treasure. One of the most important architectural feats in all of human history. Gaudi spent 43 years planning the details of this structure. His genius and the dedicated work of his disciples have made this a modern marvel \u2026",
          "Wonderfully gorgeous and immensely crazy. I just love this building and all its beauty coupled with the ambitions. Buy a pass and go in there, you will not regret it for sure!",
          "It is beautiful but not yet finished",
          "Absolutely stunning.  Pay the money to go inside and walk around,  you will not regret it.",
          "Masterpiece. Must visit. Locals probably don\u2019t like it. The construction has been going on for over 140 years now and it\u2019s obvious why. The sculptures are incredibly intricate. Gaudi is probably unhappy with how it has turned out now. It is questionably in many ways not your typical church. Some of the sculptures don\u2019t really make sense.",
          "Loved it but I am always shocked to see that we have to pay to visit an unfinished basilica. It is still wonderful! It's a must see. But there are still construction works :(",
          "Loved the inside of the church but going up the tower is a waste of time and money.  You don't get great views and most of the time you are in a poorly lit tower with minimal windows walking down 400 stairs.   Thankfully I had a flashlight on my phone or I never would have made it down safely.",
          "Very magnificent place. Love how magnificent this building is. It is still under construction after all these years.. But still a good place to go to. Lots of tourists and one of the places to see in Barcelona",
          "Beautiful cathedral, will be completed by 2026. I will need to visit once more \ud83d\ude04 Lights inside were magnificant.",
          "After nearly a decade of hoping for the opportunity to visit this place, it was so very exciting to visit. This place is very special and the story of it's design and personality it's creator, Gaudi, is interesting on its own. I highly \u2026",
          "Cool place. Looks like they are still building it. \u20ac6 beers right outside if you want to pay a premium for a nice selfie \ud83e\udd33",
          "This place is awe inspiring! It is so big and it's not even done! There were a ton of people there so be prepared for that. We saw a review that said it wasn't worth it to go in due to construction.....WRONG!!! So glad we didn't listen. It \u2026",
          "La Sagrada Familia is absolutely a great place to go in Barcelona. The design of exterior and interior are very majestic even though some parts of it is not finished yet. Its recommended to purchase online ticket before you go here so you can save some time to enjoy more about this place.",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Came back this year and did the audio tour and tower again, then sat outside eating at the cafe across the street with a great view. Wonderful place",
          "Truly magical... Remarkable achievement and the inside forest floor is memorable.. Don't miss it",
          "This is an amazing structure. Well worth the time and money. Only difficulty was locating stops one, two, and three that the audio device had in it's memory. Never did find them. The artwork depicts  the life of Christ. If you've seen cathedrals, you might think you can take a pass on this one. But don't!",
          "A very popular place in Barcelona. Remember to book tickets in advance. We were there during Christmas 2019 but the tickets were sold out until new year 2020.",
          "If you can book the tickets online just like us, definitely no need to queue.\n\nPersonally i was happy that i went there in the late afternoon. Because i really like the sunset shined though the \u201cyellow-glass-window\u201d! \n\nThe explanations \u2026",
          "Its Still Cool to see it but absolutely Not Worth its Price. You walk in and you're like \"Oh ok good.\" Then you walk out.",
          "One of the most elaborate buildings in the world! You haven't seen anything like this before. Gaudi's ideas are unique. Such attention to detail was unprecedented.",
          "Absolutely beautiful, the best time to get the best visual of the inside is between mid-day and afternoon.  If you don't see anything else you have to visit this work of art!",
          "Astonishing but overcrowded and overpriced. Too crowded to take the time to get inside and the price scared me off. The look from the outside is however still free and I can recommend it. It really is crazy, and normally I don't bother checking out the tourist places but this one was definitely worth the trip.",
          "Once in a lifetime experience. The building is impressive and one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.",
          "Absolutely stunning. Recommend paying for the tour and understanding all the amazing detail. Came to Barcelona with my husband on our honeymoon and we went to see this. We loved it. We also paid to go to the top.. view was incredible! Scary to walk back down the spiral staircase but so so stunning.",
          "The Sagrada Familia Is definitely an attraction you cannot miss.  Buy your tickets online and take the audio tour. This will save you from paying the tour guides and is a fantastic way of seeing the Basilica. Also the towers are a great addition to your regular pass.",
          "Beautiful structure and well organized way of entering. Keep in mind that the entrance for prebooked tickets are on the other side of where you purchase tickets day of. You also go through a type of security check point upon entry",
          "Amazing! This place is absolutely stunning and I can\u2019t believe how much effort went into it. The high level of attention to detail is phenomenal. They mentioned that it would be fully built by 2026. I highly recommend getting the audio guide if you go",
          "Very impressive building, like nothing I had ever seen before. We didn't go in as it was very expensive and the lines were super long, but even viewing it from the outside is worth the trip",
          "One of Gaudis best architectural work. Quite accessible through by foot and local transport.",
          "Very nice to look at. There is a lot to see and the story is really interesting. \n\nI have to say that I was disappointed with the tower. We had to pay a lot to get up there and we had to wait for quite a while. In the tower we went to, we \u2026",
          "Very beautiful building.  The size of it is unbelievable. Crowds are everywhere,  plan ahead. Do not expect to go inside without pre-purchased tickets.",
          "Awe-inspiring and beautiful. The architecture style will leave you amazed",
          "Absolutely exceeded my expectations in so many ways.  An absolute spectacle and enjoyed every minute. Recommend getting at least an audio guide so you can get an understanding of the reasoning behind the certain parts of the buildings.  Book well in advance!!!",
          "Exquisitely jaw dropping. Seriously,  my jaw dropped, goosebumps appeared, my heart pounded hard, and my head spinned all while tears filled up in my eyes upon entering. I have some started just thinking about it.  We visited the nativity \u2026",
          "Fantastic architectural design. This church is different. It is amazing. So large. Seeing it from outside is not enough. You have to go inside  to see the details and the materials.  I suggest paying extra  and get the audio to understand \u2026",
          "Must see if you are Barcelona. From the outside it is spectacular already. If you pay to get it is even nicer. If you go in, I would take the option to go into one of the towers and you get some views from Barcelona. One downside is that it is massively visited and always overcrowded.",
          "Didn't go up the towers but don't think our visit we as hindered by it! Beautiful architecture and sculpture.",
          "The area around the church is so beautiful. We did not go inside, but it was an awesome site to see. The architecture is impeccable and unique. I can't wait to go back in the future to see when it's completed.",
          "More beautiful than I have ever imagined. I had an audiovisual tour of the inside and outside of this stunning Basilica. Would recommend this tourist attraction to everyone who visits Barcelona.",
          "What a beautiful place. It's a must visit at least once in your life time. Words really are not enough, you just have to experience it .",
          "La Sagrada Familia is the number one attraction in Barcelona and the most beautiful Basilica I've seen in the whole world. This is Gaudi's masterpiece and rightfully so. You can literally spend hours outside just analysing all the small \u2026",
          "A must see place but not necessarily to go inside. High volume of tourists even during the off season. A walk around would do, taking in account that each side is different from the other. Enjoy an icecream while seating on a bench in the \u2026",
          "Incredible architecture, but there's a ton of visitors. Take time to appreciate each facade and the interior columns and stained windows. It's definitely worth it to visit the towers to get a unique experience. You get to see the intricate details of the form and a view of the whole city.",
          "Spectacular. The architects vision is being carried out while staying true to his narrative. The project and construction management team is doing a phenomenal job to complete this project by 2025 in time for the centennial celebrations.",
          "Booked tickets in advance. What a wonderful building. Definitely go back in 2026 to see when it's completed",
          "Love that place. Full with people. Near is also other nice places to visit",
          "Beautiful cathedral that you can spend hours just looking at the fine detail. Well worth the money to go up into one of the towers and get a breathtaking view of the city. Be prepared though, it has tight corridors and those afraid of heights could get some wobbly legs.",
          "This holy place is probably the most beautiful man-made structure I have ever had the pleasure of visiting in my whole life. I can visit this place 10 more times and still be amazed with the entire history, architecture and story it has to \u2026",
          "Although crowded, it is one of the most beautiful buildings I have seen in my life.",
          "Incredible Barcelona's landmark. The inside is much beautiful than the outside. Always book tickets in advance.",
          "It was good decision to visit it. Beautiful, magnificent. It's important to take audio guide",
          "A mind blowing architectural design in the world.",
          "Unbelievable. I've never experienced anything like this in my life, its absolutely amazing and I feel like i left so much richer with a deep understanding of the history behind it. I went with the full experience of audio guide and tower \u2026",
          "Lots of tourist and a massive construction site, very dusty. The building do look amazing from the outside, never went inside as there were just too many people and you need adanvce booking. Beware of pickpockets, there are lots, its unbelievable.",
          "I had purposely decided against looking for any pictures or depictions of the interior, and well, it was the best decision I could have made. It's already impressive from the outside, but the moment I entered I was awestruck. Absolutely \u2026",

          "Very expensive but worth every penny. Be sure to take the audio guide. Best time to see is early or late in the day. Best at sunny weather.",
          "Oh my gosh! What amazing, breathtaking, beautiful architecture, art, and history! One tour is just not enough to get it all in. The entirety of the experience is almost overwhelming. The stories, the colors, the techniques, the logic behind \u2026",
          "Very impressive to see. It's important to plan ahead if you also want to enter the building and purchase the ticket online a few days before. Also I recommend to go with a guide that can explain you all the history of it.",
          "Just beautiful. We booked ahead and got pretty much straight in. Even if you're not religious, the stained glass work and sculpture should appeal to anyone. Sunny days are the best so you can really appreciate the light from the glass!",
          "Absolutely awesome! But I'd think it's time they end the new additions...it's losing it's character",
          "Awesome, fabulous inside and out. Full of surprises. A must visit.",
          "A cathedral like no other! Must see! The stained glass is amazing. A bit expensive, but totally worth it.",
          "I have to say this is a really impressive building. Its amazing to think it's still being built and will probably not be finished for another 30+ years. Now if you're a builder/architect this is the contract you want to get \ud83e\udd23\n\nWe didn't go \u2026",
          "A remarkable place! One of the places that you don't understand it's beauty if you don't see it in front of you with your own eyes. It is one of those places you need to visit at least once in your lifetime. The only problem is the huge \u2026",
          "Very pretty on the outside a must see. But I honestly don't think you need to buy the pricey ticket (20+ euro) to go inside. Yes it's very pretty but most of that is visible from the outside. It may be different if you are religious.",
          "This is truly a magical place to visit, especially on a sunny day where you can see the sunlight entering through the stained glass and coloring the inside of the building. Definitely choose the audio guide, you will miss out on way too \u2026",
          "It's one of Antoni Gaud\u00ed's most famous creations in Barcelona. People who visit Barcelona will not miss out this magnificent basilica, I believe. It's one of the most famous landmarks or structures in the world.",
          "An incredible church, which mixes religion, nature, architecture, very good ideas, etc. After the Saint Peter in Roma, I am very surprised to know something even bigger. Sagrada Familia is so light and modern: what a feeling when you go \u2026",
          "Very impressive building. I'm not sure it's worth going inside, I think it's more impressive to look at the building in contrast to the city around it. If you do go inside there are fantastic views from the tower. The guide keeps refering \u2026",
          "I've never seen something like this, it's breathtaking. It's a must see if you're in Barcelona. Is till under construction (will be finished in 2026), but it's worth it. We bought tickets online (basic ticket 18 Euro- which included temple \u2026",
          "What can I say about this Church....... Gaudy's dream in the making. The most wonderful place and most significant craft and workmanship I ever saw! Must see it!"

        "wiki": "Tibidabo (Catalan pronunciation: [ti\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0a\u03b2u]) is a hill overlooking Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. At 512 metres (1,680 ft), it is the tallest hill in the Serra de Collserola.  Rising sharply to the north-west, it has views over the city and the surrounding coastline.The summit of the hill is occupied by the Sagrat Cor church and adjacent Tibidabo Amusement Park. The Torre de Collserola telecommunications tower is a short walk away. All three are prominently visible from most of the city of Barcelona. Designed by Enric Sagnier, the church took 60 years to construct and is topped by a sculpture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Josep Miret Llopart.\nTibidabo can be reached by road or via the Tibidabo Funicular, which was the first of its kind in Spain, and by the Tramvia blau, but both are currently out of service. Replacement bus TC2 connects Tibidabo with Avinguda de Tibidabo Metro station. The Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona minibus service 111 connects it to Vallvidrera village and the upper station of the Vallvidrera funicular.\n\n\n== Origin of the name ==\n\nThe name derives from the Latin Vulgate Bible verses:\n\n\"\u2026et dixit illi haec tibi omnia dabo si cadens adoraveris me\" \u2013 \"And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me\" (Matthew 4:9);\n\"\u2026et ait ei tibi dabo potestatem hanc universam et gloriam illorum quia mihi tradita sunt et cui volo do illa\" \u2013 \"All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it\" (Luke 4:6).This phrase, meaning I will give to you, was said to Jesus by the devil as they looked down from an exceedingly high mountain upon all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. The name of Barcelona's hill thus refers to the popular tradition that it was in fact the exceedingly high mountain itself. The phrase Tibi dabo forms part of the inscription in the central dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, although in that case it was drawn from Jesus' words to St. Peter in Matthew 16:19.\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasino Internacional Tibidabo\nList of mountains in Catalonia\nThe Shadow of the Wind\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Nice activity with children when visiting Barcelona. Not excessively expensive entry tickets and a variety of attractions that will keep children and adults busy for a few hours. Jus be aware that attractions are not of the level of Port Aventura and food prices are super",

          "I went with my daughter; we both enjoy it. I think it worth if you are in Barcelona to spend a day there. Fantastic view and great attractions. Bus from downtown take us there for 2.5 euro something - it is not attractions that scare \"the hell-out-of-you\" like in the newest",

          "This was recommended to me by a local. I was not aware of the rides at the top. The funicular was not working, so had to get the bus. The bus does not take cash, so make sure you have a payment card with you. The views were great, well worth it. There are some places to eat",

          "Well worth a visit if you have young kids. Great setting with it being at the top of a mountain. The queues for the rides aren\u2019t too long so you can get around quite quickly. Though not a theme park equipped with white knuckle rides there is the odd surprisingly good attraction.",
          "The park is nice for young kids, we arrives at 11am when the park opens and were lucky to play few before the crowd. Later during the day, it get crowded with queues but bearable and the waiting time is acceptable. We almost tried everything except the rides for older kids.",
          "Whether you have a family or not, Tibidabo is worth visiting. Simply walking around and having the views of Barcelona is worth the trip. You can take the funicular or the bus or both (one way for each). The amusement park is for younger children and maybe teenagers, but",
          "I didn't do any rides but it's still worth going ti for the views alone, the church there is lovely too. It can be a bit of a hassle getting there the cheapest is by the train bus and funicular from plaza Catalonia but the fun way is on the blue tram and funicular. The houses",

          "The parc is alot of fun and not to expensive for a full day of fun. The views you get from some of the attractions are amazing. My biggest issue is the lack of a good restaurant nearby, you must bring your own food to eat something decent.",

          "This is another underrated attraction at BCN which also happens to be quite cheap compared to other attractions. Getting there can be quite a long way, with the need for funicular. Costs around 7.5 euros 2 ways, and with few more euros you can get access to the parc games. There",

          "The park has many levels of fun, most of the rides are designed to take full advantage of the view,Hotel Krueger is a must, don;t miss it. Is a great park for everyone.",
          "Didn\u2019t manage to get on the funicular which was a great shame. We took the bus and strolled around for a few hours. The view is spectacular and if you visit the church you can go even higher ! We entered the fairground although didn\u2019t go on the rides, looks good though. Busy",
          "great place for all the family, plenty to do and see, loads of places to eat, the only thing I didn't like was you couldn't buy single tickets for rides so a bit disappointing when you have young children, but worth a visit.",
          "it was the most beautiful experience in Barcelona. It's such a magical place you have to see when visiting Barcelona. This place is a trip for 1/2 day or all day.lot of atraction in park and amazing Basilica,you must see it! Place is interesting when weather is nice.",
          "This is the second oldest amusement park in Europe. The rides are'nt really special because is a par for young children not for adults or teenagers. The views of the city are great. You can access to the highest part of the park without the whole day ticket and enjoy some the",
          "This place worth the visit. Only thing I didn\u2019t like, you can buy single tickets for rides but only for few attractions. Which I would say it\u2019s shame. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201ca must\u201d to buy ticket for whole park. Can enter without ticket and just walk around. Nice views there.",
          "I kept seeing this from a distance when sightseeing other attractions and finally found out the name and decided to visit, we took the brown metro line to Av. Tibidabo, then walked across the road where you get a 196 bus to the ticket office, however the tram was closed so you",
          "Being on the top of the city you will have a spectacular view on Barcelona. It worths to go there, do not miss it! :)",
          "We had an amazing time !!!! the view is breath taking , but that didn't take away from the great fun we had , we will come back soon",
          "My wife and I visited Barcelona in October and pre-booked tickets to Tibidabo as there was only the Sunday we could go. Unfortunately due to the weather the Park was closed. However we only found this out after waiting for an hour at the bus stop . No information on the web",
          "Despite being there while it was raining and cold, my family & I had an amazing time!!! Quite a few of the rides were still operating even while it was raining. I'm sure the view is breath taking, but that didn't take away from the great fun we had. We'll definitely be returning",
          "A little confusing to navigate tickets and prices and activities. Was freezing atop the mountain. Needed more layers. Too cold to stay long. Very whimsical and charming",
          "Very cute and beautiful place. Nice for visiting with kids. The only thing you need to keep in mind is traffic jam in exit in the evening hours. Plan to leave at least one hour before closing to avoid stuck. Important! You can pay for parking only on the 3d level at cashier desk.",
          "We heard about Tibidado from our taxi driver the day before as a most see because next to the amusement park there is this beautiful church with the biggest Christ on top. The taxi cannot take you all the way to the top but it is about a half a mile on an incline. The view is",
          "Myself and a friend took a day trip here however you can be done in 2-3 hours. After reading reviews we decided to get the metro to Tibidabo. We got L3 and then changed to L7 not realising we would have to scan in again where all other stations you can easily change. On exiting",
          "The park is ok, but small. It was very crowded. It is expensive for what it offers. The bus that brings you there didn't arrive for a long time.",
          "Visiting the amusement parc off season is not totally reccommended. Acctractions were closed according to staff still we saw people on the rollercoaster... A few restaurants were open but slow...",
          "The amusement park is somewhat run down and tired, but the most striking aspect is its location, since it is set at the top of a mountain and beside the stunning church of Templo del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas. (See \"Templo del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\" for further details",
          "Tibidabo must see everybody who will be in Barcelona. It's amazing and it't for free. Only if you would like to go to the tower you'll pay 3 \u20ac. But it isn't necessary. The view is beautiful from the places, which are for free. For fun (main for children) is there Amusement",
          "The view and church were totally worth the trip!! The cable car closes early and the park was ok but not worth it if you don\u2019t have children with you.",
          "If you go to Barcelona you must visit this! First of all I'd like to tell u that u cand arrive by taxi(is cheap and faster) till \"funicular tibidabo) and then you take that \"tram\" that it s there. The price is 7.50 but if u want you cand buy the 11.90 \u20ac because you have included",
          "Nice to get out of the city and away from the crowds. Caught metro, walked up hill then caught the 100-year old funicular. Views were amazing and the old church was cute and worth seeing, Enjoyed all of it.",
          "This is an amazing way to see the city, and really loved the Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor - the church. We didn't pay for the amusements as you can just pay for the ferris wheel individually and there didn't seem to be many other rides that we were interested in. The food",
          "So fun! We visited in October so about half of the amusement park was closed but the ferris wheel, talaia, avionics and carrousel were all operating. We spent a couple hours in the amusement park, which is condensed and easily walkable and affords TREMENDOUS views of Barcelona",
          "Tibidabo is easily reached by a combination of subway, funicular and bus. You can complete this journey with on single subway ticket. It takes approximately 1 hour from the city centre (Placa de Catalunya subway line S2 or S3). The funicular and bus rides alone are worth the",
          "Here was a very good day for our kids and we had different ages from 9 to 19, plus the adults and we all enjoyed very much. It\u2019s a three floor park with many rides to get on, for all different ages. They have food, drinks and an spectacular view!! I\u2019m not sure if they have",
          "Great views over the city worth a visit just for those, and a visit to the church is a must stunning building, didn't go on the rides but would would visit again.",
          "I didn't go into the amusement park, however I guess it's a good place for the kids to go to. We went to the top and there were great views, the ferris wheel also stands out in the pictures with its colours. Definitely worth a visit and it was beautiful.",
          "The actual amusement park is nothing special but I guess for kids it\u2019s allright. But what\u2019s best in here is the view over the city. That alone is easily worth the visit. Don\u2019t bother eating here...",
          "They charged us the full prize although half the attractions were out of service. When we took the big wheel, it stopped when people got off. Then they forgot us on the top of the wheel where we had to wait for 15 minutes - we had to shout at the people down at the bottom so",
          "I visited with my nephew while in Barcelona for a week, Great park easy to get to and worth a visit, I will defiantly come Again when back in the area,",
          "I have a 5 year old and a one year old and we all enjoyed it.....such a great park with an outstanding view....i advise you all to visit it especially that the bus tickets from plaza Catalunya to Tibidabo are refunded by the park.....but make sure you spend the whole day there",
          "The view from the park is spectacular and the sight of the incredible church as a backdrop to children playing on rides is really amazing. Worth the trip to the mountain top even though we did not actually ride on any of the attractions.",
          "Go to the top of the cathedral for the sunset, not a lot of people there and the view is fantastic. If you want to go to the old part of attractions it\u2019s open till 19.00 but it is worth it! The bus goes from the ferrocarril so makes you pay nothing literally.",
          "Old but interesting amusement park with great views of Barcelona. But is only oriented to Catalan people because everything is in Catalan language, even the cinema, the employees can't ( don't want) to speak Spanish or English",
          "Revisited on the way to the airport. As we only had about 2 hours we limited ourselves to a purchase of the Panoramic Level ticket which reduces the cost to 12.70 but even so there is not much you can access/ride on at this level, and TBH you can access the park and view without",
          "As we were in Barcelona I kept seeing this place and wondered what it was, so it was thrilling it be able to go and adventure up to it. We paid for the bus to go half way up the mountain but you didn\u2019t need to because it was a short walk up (if you struggle with steep hills",
          "Wonderful views and a lovely amusement park for the kids. Spectacular scenery. We had an amazing time here.",
          "My 6th visit to one of my favorit cities together with my coaster enthusiast friend. So having done all of the top touristic stuff before we've headed over to Tibidabo. The park has 2 coasters. Muntanya Russa is the newest of the 2 coasters in this park. It's really fun and",
          "The distance we traveled and all the hype I\u2019m sorry but this did not live up to the expectations for me personally, though we did get some really good pics..... this place is just your regular fun fair / amusement park thing.... sorry nothing special",
          "Visiting Tibidado park is a must in baca You drive or take a taxi or a bus or a tram or even bike Smell of fresh air from the mountain facing all Barcelona from the port to the city parts you can see from there Restaurant kids play area Transportation is avaliable and so easy",
          "Save your money and don\u2019t go to the amusement park. For a start you don\u2019t really need to, there are plenty of other things for the kids to enjoy in Tibidabo, and also I don\u2019t understand how parents who love their kids could think to put them on these death trap rides \u2014 many are",
          "Tibidabo can be easily reached from the center of Barcelona - take T2A bus at Catalunya square (it is Tibidabo express) and in 30-40 minutes at 3 euro price ticket you will be on the hill. We liked this bus very much: it is not crowded at all and in very hot weather you feel",
          "I thought I was dreaming. They do not have places in the parking structure , which is quite big, where you can pay with a machine with card or cash. You need to go in line with a bunch of people in a separate building across the street and it is super slow. Unbelievable!!",
          "I love this little park, it's not got massive rides, but it's got unique rides and a friendly relaxed atmosphere. The park is free to enter, so you can just wonder around if you want to and get some food. It was busy on the day of our visit, but we still did all the rides we",
          "The amusement park did not meet our expectations - it was too expensive for the rides it offered. We first tried the Panoramic tickets for our family (of 4), but we could really not take the interesting rides (only the rides on top level were included). So we had to upgrade to",
          "Me and my other half went here on our recent holiday to Barcelona. It was a really nice day out, and it wasn't busy at all. We were able to go on every ride we wanted to in a few hours (Apart from 1, as it wasn't open). I would recommend going if you have a spare day in",
          "Yes the view is breathtaking, the rides not so much, but anyway there is something for everybody from toddler to teen",
          "This is a amusement park suitable for younger children. They also have attractions for older children and adults, but the youngest ones will have an unforgettable day. Thanks to the parks location and settings you have shade all the time which is really good in the sunny days.",
          "It was a very nice experience. It is so calm and architecture is beautiful. From Barcelona center you can take a bus which costs just \u20ac3 one side. Restaurant there serves very tasty tapas. Don't miss it. Games were little costly.",
          "Starting with the tram up the mountain side added to the experience before even entering the park. The park itself is split levels with rides & views of Barcelona that everyone can enjoy.",
          "We had a great time here, not the easiest to get to but worth the effort. The rides are not huge but good enough for my boys who both had a good day out. Would recommend going for a day",
          "The rollercoaster provides a phenomenal view of Barcelona. Some queuing at the most popular rides, but the virtual express is worth the wait.",
          "Anything worth doing has an hour wait even when not that busy. Basically a third world amusement park. Should\u2019ve left after first ride.",
          "It is expensive for what it is and tbh you can have a great time with just the panoramic tickets (you can then access the big wheel, the plane, the church and a few other bits) but I couldn\u2019t really do that to my kids having seen the other rides below and just took the hit. For",
          "Visited this place on August, 8th, 2018. Had to queue for half an hour, then we had been charged too much. The assistant took forever to correct her mistake so we could get a refund. No eye contact or apology for the long time it took her to sort out. She was also chewing",
          "This place is perfect for fun and for great shots from you with Barcelone under your feet. Tasty frozen yoghurt and churros are available. We did not try any of the amusement park rides but if you just go to see the church and the view at dawn believe me it is a must.",
          "Just visit. With. The. Family. The. Best. Experience I. Have. Walking views. The. City off Barcelona. Nice. Place. To. Visit. Again",
          "I took my 5yo here for a special day out recently. It was so much fun! She wasn\u2019t a fan of the queues for the most popular rides, so we went on a lot of the smaller ones instead. She loved the Tibi City one where she got to drive a car. All of the instructions were given in",
          "We liked Tibidado park, purshased only Panoramic tickets. Waiting time was from 10 till 40 minutes. At ticket desk didn't see information abou seperate tickets.",
          "The amusement park is small, there is no roller coaster with loops. Different tickets are not well explained, there are big queues for the most interesting attractions. Cafe services are extremely slow. I generally do not recommend going there.",
          "Kid wanted to revisit the ride with the airplane. It probably takes about 12 people at a time... had to wait over 40 minutes in the scorching heat. Similar lines for most other amusements. There are luckily plenty of vendors with cold drinks and water. Was there before on",
          "I've visited Tibidabo cathedral and amusement park during my trip in Barcelona, and without a shadow of a doubt it's one of my fav palce there! To reach tibidabo you can take many ways, a tram (old fashoned one to get into the mood), the car if you have one or a very very cheap",
          "It used to be amusment for everyone a cetury ago, but lot has changed since then. It\u2019s still worth to visit for the view of Barcelona alone (from Talaia: 550m AMSL). Or if you like oldtimer amusement parks? Do come early, before they even start to sell the tickets, because",
          "Great park over looking Barcelona. Lots of low key fun. The haunted hotel is excellent. Avoid the tourist shop underneath the church outside the park, the guy there tried to short change me.",
          "While this place used to be amazing and cool aproximadamente 30 plus years ago, not much have been improved here since then. The views are still unbeatable and it has a wow effect to visit, however the rides are very old and dated. Service is very average and prices high. City",
          "This place is actaully one of the most beautifull places we ever seen..It is something that you must see",
          "Went to this place just for the view. The views from here over the city are stunning. There\u2019s a small fair ground for children but it\u2019s a little over priced.",
          "Think of Disneyland, but with only the basic rides, and built on the side of a steep hill. Our children enjoyed the visit, but we were all frustrated at waiting 45 to 60 minutes per ride. Also, it did not help that during July the place is swarming with summer campers.",
          "Fantastic experience. A definite must visit. The church situated in Tibidabo is breathtaking. The church is active and boasts the most amazing and tranquil setting. Excellent amusement park with great food and service. A small bar situated in Tibidabo allows you to view all of",
          "We visited by getting off tour bus and catching bus (tram was off for repair) up to funicular which takes you to top of tibidabo! Bit strange to have the amusement park in the shadow of the lovely church, weird combination! Don\u2019t expect crazy high rollercoasters and state of the",
          "Hello there! Been to Tibidabo a couple of days ago and I\u2019m speechless. Still, I\u2019m gonna try to put a few words in here for you that want to go to visit. Stunning view indeed and the short journey with the funicular was so adventurous as is on a very abrupt hill. We\u2019ve been lucky",
          "Our last day in Barcelona, so we wanted to pass our time. From Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya L7, to the end station, then bus 196 to the top. Bus cost \u20ac2.2 per singe trip, which I thought was expensive. At the top, we took the Funicular to Tibidabo. Funicular lacked charm, poorly",
          "Hi, It is by far the Most beautiful view from Barcelona. The panorama of the city is incredible. The park is fun but could be better. After all is the oldest fun park.",
          "Worth visiting just to see the amazing view! We didnt pay for the amusement park but we visited the church where you can visit the towers by the price of 3.50 euros with an elevator. Amazing and the church is very beautiful. The funicular ride was also quite fun. Can imagine",
          "Quite a busy park, we noticed the big church from miles away and thats how we decided to come here. The funicular up to the amusement park is pretty expensive, cost us 15.40 for 2 people to get up there and back. Church is an impressive building, although we didn't go inside -",
          "This the 2nd time I have been. Very little help on which ticket you need. If you dont have kids just pay for the transport. 1 The Blue Tram wasn't working. 2 The replacement Bus is \u20ac4.40 return, if 3 or more take a Taxi. 3 The Automoton Museum 75% not working. 4 Go on a clear",
          "Best views of the city for sure...Avoid the restaurant for food, drinks are ok, hard to mess up. Make sure to explore the highest point of the church also..",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Tibidabo Amusement Park. Our daughter, like my husband and myself enjoys amusement parks. Our recurring statement during our trip to Spain, to our daughter was things are different. The lines were about 10-15 minutes, which is great when you are use to",
          "So we took a short taxi from our hotel (my taxi app so good) to the bottom of tibidabo to catch the blue tram to the top and with a 2year old she loved it... we travelled in june weather was perfect not to hot but hot enough\ud83d\ude0a got to the top and literally blown away could not",
          "Fun amusement park with the best views in Barcelona. Definitely worth a trip up the hill! The kids will enjoy the rides, and you will enjoy the gorgeous view!",
          "Wow what a view!!! Such a peaceful place to send a couple of hours. We didn't buy tickets in advance and had no problem getting in.",
          "Excellet views over the city, can get higher via the church also. Worth a trip up there. The TV tower is also very close (included in Barcelona card if you have that).",
          "The amusement park is located directly next to the Sagrat Cor church, which is weird. However, the church is more worth seeing than the rides in this park, which resemble more of a carnival than an amusement park. Staff was very friendly and that is why I am not giving it one",
          "It is easy to get there from city, take the L7 train to end then get on 196 bus which is about 50m up the street from station exit. Go to the second bus stop not the first. This will take you up to the cable car 11.70euro each for entry and two rides that\u2019s enough. When you get",
          "Easy access by bus from Plaza Catalunya. As Barcelona's tallest peak, it offers you a breathtaking view of the beautiful Cathedral del Sagrat Cor, and the entire city while enjoying the breeze coming from the ocean.... Enjoy a beer, tapas or ice cream and bring your camera out",
          "A little bit of a whirlwind to arrive to from the centre of Barcelona but pretty straight forward once you've got the gist of it. Get the train to Av. Tibidabo and walk out of the station straight forward towards the bus stop which has bus 196 running. Catch the bus to the",
          "Absolutely brilliant experience. I recently took a school trip of 80 students to Barcelona. We had already visited PortAventura and it was far too busy. 2 hours plus to get on rides. Although Tibidabo couldn't offer rides on the same scale as PortAventura, it was a far better",
          "A rainy weekend in Barcelona saw us take a trip on the metro up to Tibidabo via the funicular. The location is excellent for a view of Barcelona city with some of the ride offering a slightly vantage point.",
          "Beautiful. Take the tram up and down. On top of the world in Barcelona. We didn\u2019t go for the rides but they looked like fun.",
          "Wonderful experience when visiting Barcelona. Takes you back to your childhood memories of past amusement park rides. Enjoy spectacular view overlooking Barcelona and the Mediterranean",
          "My granddaughter wanted to go to amusement park while in Barcelona. We went on a Saturday afternoon. It was crowed but the lines were not overly long. There was entertainment for all ages and the refreshments were plentiful for a upcharge.",
          "We went up to see the church but when we saw that there was a theme park we were very excited! We didn\u2019t want to pay the 28 euros for the entry ticket as we were unsure how long we wanted to stay so we brought tickets for the rides we wanted to go on. These tickets were 2 euros",
          "Well worth the multiple public transport to get here from Poblenou!!!! The views alone make you forget you are in a full on FUN PARK!!!",
          "so glad we did this. we were short on time with only a few days to see sites, glad we did this as it was lovely view over Barcelona, having had an exciting ride up the side of the mountain on the railway car. we went on the big wheel and in the by-plane and inside the church.",
          "Not all it was cracked up to be. Amusement park was probably nice for families with little kids. Most of the windows on the tram going up the hill were covered in graffiti so seeing the view was not possible. Church was beautiful and have great views of the city.",
          "Amazing place to visit if you are in Barcelona. Easy to access it from any part of the city, view is amazing",
          "in the top of the mountain you can see a big church cloe to the amusment park, you can see a big area of Barcelona and other cities close to it",
          "That atractions were super entertaining but also long queues and kids with awful behavior. Maybe little expensive.",
          "wow \u2026 absolutely blows you away .. the views are spectacular. there are lots of things to do, park, amusements even free shows \u2026 but the view is the best for barca.",
          "Great place to have a different view. You can visit the church, the amusement park. You can take you own food and make a picnic in some tables that you can find there",
          "Getting here is not the easiest. But we managed to get here and walk from the City Tour bus stop. But I would advise using local bus as the walk is steep. However we did use the VEHICULAR train if that's the word and that was fun . The park itself had unique rides in a stunning",
          "On a sunny day there is no better place to look out over the city than this. Located at the highest point in Barcelona, make sure you check it out. There is a beautiful church building adjacent to the park and a very good restaurant and bar. There are not a heap of rides, but",
          "Really great way to see the views of Barcelona. It all feels a little surreal when you get to the top but it\u2019s a really nice place. We got the tube really easily from the centre then the bus to the funicular (the tram wasn\u2019t running). Really well organised and run. We didn\u2019t go",
          "Great place to visit with kids. Make sure they are over 120cm in height in order to get the most of it. Close to Barcelona city.",
          "I was with my family there yesterday. Only 4 things working because is not week end . Only the view is good there . Is like an old amusement place ... i don\u2019t recommand .",
          "Far, ugly attractions all dated. Too expensive for what it is. Really not worth the detour. You get better views from Montjuic park!",
          "Amazing views over barcelona in an interesting part of town. The church at the top is breath-taking and well worth a visit. Didn't go into the theme park, but it appeared a little strange and overpriced.",
          "We travelled from Port Vell on the V13 which took around 40-45 minutes. The second bus 196 was a shorter 5 minute journey to the funicular stop. As we arrived staff were turning away tourists saying it was closed despite the sign clearly stating the last ride departs at 18:15.",
          "Best place to see the city from up the Mountain. Great views and nice place to wander around and have a picnic",
          "We didn\u2019t know about this place and when the kids saw it, they wanted to try. It was full of families and teens. Really loud latina music and crowded. We didn\u2019t feel to safe there and make sure the kids were holding us all the time. But it was interesting experience for them.",
          "My friends and I lived in BCN for about 4 months. We decided to take the hike up to Tibidabo towards the end of our time in Spain. It was about a 30 minute taxi from where we lived, so we planned ahead of time. The views from the park were beautiful, even the views on the drive",
          "It was extremely crowded and had to wait 20-30 minutes for 90% of the rides. But the view is spectacular, had fun with most of the rides. The rides are for children (3-10) mostly, would not recommend for older ones (but I recommend the view). Just buy a funicular ticket without",
          "The amusement park at Tibidabo is very well worth going but mainly for the fantastic setting and views.The main reason to visit should be the visit to the fantastic Cathedral set on the highest peak of mountains around Barcelona. Breathtaking views, a magical Cathedral set to be",
          "The best viewpoint of Barcelona over 500 m above the city. Well worth to ride up and have a look or to explore the magnificent church on top of the mountain. If you have children, the Fun Park will satisfy the kids needs!",
          "I would say that the best ride here is the funicular. They have also good views to the city. Otherwise i would say this is a place for age group 10 or under.",
          "This review is mainly for the abysmal food and service on offer at the amusement park. I really don't need to say much about the church and the views as they speak for themselves. Absolutely stunning! Let's get on to the restraunt there shall we.. we ordered chicken strips that",
          "When visiting Barcelona you have to include Tibidabo on your to see list, it is as incredible as you might have seen on photos online. The church is stunning and the architecture and workmanship that has gone in to this incredible. The mosaic inside is stunning. The views up",
          "While visiting Barcelona, we had a rainy day that thwarted some of our other plans. We were staying near the Gracia area and had been curious about the Ferris wheel atop the mountain and decided to find our way up there. You will have to take a trolley up to a tram station in",

          "My husband and I travel all the way from Africa for our spring break vacation and all we want to see is all the local church but seam time we want our kids to be happy SO I want to say this place very convenient for family, nearby is nice interesting church with good view in the",
          "The good: The view. Stunning views of the city from the hill. Also the fenicular is fun, especially if you have kids. The bad: Going to amusement parks usually means spend the day in queues. This is one of the worst and the most annoying thing is that the staff don't seem to",
          "Tibidabo amusement park is by far one of my favorites. I spent my husband's birthay there and we had such a good day! I think the price is ok for what you receive - for 28 euros you can ride as many atractions as you want. I personally recoment The pirata and Mine d'oro. We also",
          "Loved the funicular, very short queue and great views across the city. Tibidabo is great for small kids but a number of amusements were closed and they didn\u2019t warn us of that or discount. Food better than many places - you can get beer and olives and decent jamon baguettes as",
          "I am typing this review whilst waiting in queue for the aero port plane ride. This is by far the worst amusement park anyone could visit not in Europe but in the world! Queue is beyond imagination (average wait time for a ride is 1 hour) and the staffs are next to useless in",
          "Not to everyone's taste but attractions kept well up to date and an interesting history. Worth the climb up to Tibidabo on a clear day for the fantastic views over the city and the huge highly decorated church.",
          "The rides are, most certainly, lame. However, the setting is worth a visit, and can be done by taking the S1 or S2 to the funicular, then a short bus ride... and use your T10 pass. We visited, looked, took in the incredible view (better than from Parc Guell), and had a peek at",
          "We went up with the funicular. No one way ticket, just return. On the hompage of the amusement park there is no information, what games are working. When we arrived, we noticed that only the panoramic area is open, and we had only 20 mins to look arund, before it closed at 4p.m.",
          "It's really fantastic place! The few which opens near the statue of Christ I'll remeber all my life! The bus to Tibidado departs from Catalonia square.",

          "I actually came up here to see the Expiatory Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the amusement park was closed. The church itself is a beauty to look at. I paid the small fee to take the elevator 3/4 of the way up the church tower and then climbed the stairs to the top. Wow,",
          "Due to traffic it was pretty slow to get up the hill by taxi. View is definitely worth it. Rides are a few and average quality but again the view is great. The small kiosk selling food had a very slow service. The restaurant was also middle quality. The church is nice. The park",
          "Came here on the train Walked up the hill to the funicular tram this is about a 15 min walk up hill and through a park I can imagine it being hard work in the summer heat but today was ok You can get the bus from the metro but we decided to walk The funicular tram is about a",
          "It is situated on top of mountain and gives perfect view of city. If you go to Barcelona you have to see this place! Old amusement park is really colorful and nice. Make sure you go on a sunny day. We decided to go back to the city by foot and it was great walk in the mountains!",
          "Stunning views, but shut during the week when we visited. Nevertheless, worth a trip to see the church and the views",
          "It was fun , it is situated on top of hill and gives good view of whole city. Loved the place.Lovely experience.",
          "This place is a bit further away from the Barcelona city centre but it is absolutely worth a visit. The old amusement park on top of the mountain looks lovely and if you go on the rides, the view of both Barcelona and the nearby Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor - you will truly",
          "Good views from the top of the church. Not sure why there is a fun fair at this location it ruins location photos.",
          "this point is set to offer a better understanding of the city it's like a google map real view - will help you to plan a quick weekend itinerary if i'll come for the first time in barcelona - start from here, end on La rambla ;)",
          "If you go to Barcelona, you have to see this place, it's a must!! Great view, great food, like I said, you must see this place!",
          "Had been here previously with my eldest - though lovely to be back again. We loved taking the Blu tram to the foot of the hills of Tibidabo, then making our way up using the older tram. Once at the top we then descended to the top of the monastery (well as far as it would take",

          "A really nice view over the whole city. The old amusement park is really colorful and nice to look at. It was closed the day we were there so we didn\u2019t try anything. Make sure you go on a sunny day.",
          "So nice place with an amazing view in the top of the hills of the city, highly recommended for kids!",
          "Wrap up as it\u2019s cold at the top Comfortable shoes Spain\u2019s oldest theme park Not great rides or thrills more fascinating and quaint The uphill tram is fun and it\u2019s simply what you make if it as a couple of family Worth the money to see a very different type of theme park",
          "The place gives a great view of the city of Barcelona. It was an easy bus ride from the city center.",
          "Rode a bike up to the church. A nice popular ride for cyclists. Last little bit to church is steep but you are rewarded with an incredible view.",
          "From the top of the Barcelona there is such a view of the city. It is breath taking. Recommend with both hands.",
          "You remember those episode? \" When i enjoy foot-tourism on the Tibidabo mountain...\" Ahhah. So was i. Great view, place with intersting energetic fon. And no, nobody wanted to get acquanted with me. Oh, poor Ross - I understand ya!",
          "On our recent trip we decided that we had to visit Tidibado so we could take some wonderful photos of the city. From getting off the tour bus we went on the blue tram up the hill. This is discounted with the vouchers you get on the bus tour. Its a nice way to start going up the",
          "This church was stunning. We paid a few euros to take the lift to the top, where we got a beautiful view of the whole city. It was very quiet when we visited, which was a bonus. This was perhaps because the theme park next door was closed. I would recommend visiting Tibidabo on",
          "This is a really old, believe the oldest, theme park in Spain/Catalonia! That said, it is very well maintained! We had a great, unplanned day here, and enjoyed the more retro attractions, including something\u2019s oldest rollercoaster!",
          "A great place to see the views of Barcelona. There is also a small amuse the park for the kids to enjoy. A great place to walk around if energetic a good walk going up or down. There is a funicular the connects or you can use the circular bus 111.",
          "Barcelona is a small city , and the place to comprehend how it develops and the best views are from Tibidabo. It is always nice to go there with family or friends, if you travel with a little kids its is nice to go there, so they can enjoy the simple pleasures of having fun in",
          "I came when the amusement park was closed. I took the L7 train from Placa de catalunya (from the metro stop in front of the Zurich cafe) to Avendia Tibidabo. You don't need a special ticket, you can use the T-10 metro pass. From there, I exited the metro and got on the blue tram",
          "Tibidabo does offer great views to Barcelona and merits a visit. As far as amusement park is concerned, be very careful about the time of your visit. If it is a vacation time, like it was in the beginning of January 2018, this becomes almost a rip off. You pay an expensive entry",
          "This place is worth a visit, just for the amazing views across Barcelona. The tram and lift is fairly pricey, but it was well worth paying for.",
          "It was worth the trip for the excellent view. The church is definitely worth a visit, especially paying for the lift to go up to the top. Breath taking views.",
          "is a great place, with a lovely view over Barcelona!!! You can see all the city from here and you can have, also, an adventure park for fun!",
          "Visited for the views and to do something a bit different in Barcelona. Not many rides for older ones, but our 11 and 14 yr old still had fun. Quite expensive as you can't pay just to access the park - you all need a wristband. You can however visit the first level without",
          "You can see Tibidabo from downtown Barcelona especially at night. It is actually an amusement park on top of the hill. You can take a tram up there and then the train. However you can visit the church and get the great view without paying they entrance fee. The 3D roller coaster",
          "Upper end of the Barcelona. Not far from the center, worth to visit for different perception of this beautiful city. Positive energy from the holy place - Templo Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas. Where you can go to the top - up to the Jesus sculpture. And of course - the oldest",
          "Well worth a visit to enjoy the view from the highest point in Barcelona. A visit inside the church is a must. Take the bus up and down.",
          "not much to see, 2 churches on top of each other, a bit weird, we walked a bit around in the surrounding area, good places if you want some peace and quiet in contrast of the busy centre",
          "To reach the hill of Tibidabo the best alternative is the funicular or perhaps if you are a sportivo and have many time, make it by walk; or by bycicle; the views are magnific and you can visit also the nice church. In my language tibi and dabo means other things.",
          "This tivoli is cozy and worth a visit even though the transportation to and from the mountain takes a long time. The view there is difficult to find better.",
          "Definitely would go again, great for kids and adults. Spent the entire day at the park and could not do all of the rides, plenty to do there. Some rides we did more than once, others the queues were a bit long and we either skipped or toughed it out. We also went in September",
          "We rode the Metro and the cable car (one metro ticket for about 1\u20ac) to the top and walked down to the city metro stopping on the way at Mirabau cafe for lunch and the amazing view over the city from the open air tables (weather was cold and sunny so the windows were wide open).",
          "We walked to the top of Tibidabo from the entrance to Collserola Park, which took about two hours. The trial was mostly uphill, although the inclines were never too steep. The views from the top are fantastic and well worth the effort. The way down can be a bit confusing. The",
          "This is one of the most Interesting amusement parks I have been to. The views from this hill is stunning. Don\u2019t expect the rides to be great, just gofor the views and the atmosphere.",
          "Children, girl 11 and boy 8 thoroughly enjoyed afternoon and evening here. There were queues but not too bad. 8 year old found the Hotel Kruger too scary so we were let out of side door before end. Some of the aminations didn't seem to work at time we were there. We enjoyed",
          "Take the tram up to Mirablau and enjoy the panoramic views over lunch or drinks. It is not worth paying an extra 7 (!) euros to the top. It is a tourist trap of rides, so maybe worth it for younger children. The church is nothing impressive. More enjoyable from afar.",
          "This is a perfect place to spend time with family, especially kids while enjoying some of the best views of Barcelona. I have been here several times with my daughter and friends, there is a Ferris wheel and other fun stuff for everyone. It is quiet big and I recommend walking",
          "The view from the top of the church is spectacular you can see the whole of Barcelona from this height. There is a lift inside the church which will take you to the top. You need to have coins to purchase your ticket from a machine. There is also a Ferris wheel which provides",
          "A great way to get a view of the city from above. This was our first stop for the morning. We took the bus, for those not in a hurry, and in good shape you can walk up the hill to funicular. There is a little amusement park at the base of the church with a few rides.",
          "Gorgeous church, amazing views, great hike up the mountain with an ever-changing perspective of Barcelona laid out beneath you as you climb. You could take the trolly, but if you've got the energy, I'd recommend climbing to the top. When you get to the church, take your time on",
          "We took a taxi up to the funicular and spent the afternoon wandering around. It was a bit chilly and windy but the views were totally worth the hike to get up there. Before going to the funicular double check that it's operating. The first time we attempted to go up it was",
          "It is always fun to go to Tibidabo with your boy/girlfriend or with the whole family! No need to go further! If you travel with children, suprise them!",
          "Would definitely recommend this attraction if you are in Barcelona. We got the train from Catalunya to Peu del Funicular. You can get the S1 or S2 train to Peu del Funicular. Be careful as when you go to the train platform there is a train that goes to Tibidabo, but it is easier",
          "We had the Hola transport ticket so we took the S2 from Placa de Catalunya and then the Funicular to Vallvidera. From there there is a small 111 bus. That takes you to Tibidado. The bus journey is pretty spectacular on its own. On arrival we had a coffee at the restaurant but",
          "After reading Dan Brown's latest book, this was a \"must-do\" on my list. I was not disappointed - stunning facility, great views. Easy access with various modes of transport. The theme park (in my opinion) is a bit out of place and do not add value to the actual attraction - but",
          "It\u2019s easy to see as it sits perched up on top of the hill but getting to it is another topic! Once we found trolley to take us up to the funicular it was a straight shot up. Magical views of Barcelona from the top. You can go up the church all the way to the statue for an extra",
          "I went there with my friend in a low season. The most of the amusement parts were closed but we were more interested the original since it\u2019s the first park in Europe. Also we went on top of the cathedral for the sunset and the view is fantastic! The highest spot of the city!!!!",
          "Nice short ride on funicular up to the mountain. If you had a hop on hop off bus then you get Euro 1.60 off the ticket. well worth it.",
          "Well worth the effort,the elevation gives some spectacular views over the city A trip on the old funicular an experience to say the least",
          "The church is beautiful; however, the main highlight of this visit is the view of the city from above. Tip: to avoid paying the tourist price and reaching the top by the Tibidabo funicular you can choose a much cheaper way: we took the train from Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya to Peu de",
          "If you are in Barcelona, i would really recommend that you do not leave Barcelona without making a trip to Tibidabo. The view will leave you breathless. Not difficult to get to either, you can take the Tibi bus or the train.",
          "There's lots to do inside but could be cheaper - it costs 28,5 Eur per person, the same price for children over 120 cm height! And we made the mistake by going there on Sunday when the park was full and we had to queue a lot.",
          "A beautiful place filled with unexpected combinations. Old beautiful church and amusement park. Great views of Barcelona. I suggest the bus or a cab. The funicular is expensive for what you get. The climb is very long but easy walking on a road. There is food at the top.",
          "Awesome panoramic view of Barcelona and the sea. Interesting amusement park at the base of the church. Lots of families with small children and teens hanging out at amusement park--beware if you're not about that kind of stuff.",
          "If you have little time, this might not be the first choice as there are so many things to see in Barcelon. But if you love a nice view from above and if you saw Vicky Barcelona of Woody Allen - then the visit is well investetd. There is a huge fun fair and a museum that",
          "I keep bugging my boyfriend I wanted to visit this beautiful church ! and we ended up going !! We visited El Sagrado Corazon de Jesus church after visits Park Guel. We got a taxis witch was round 20 euros. we spend most of our afternoon here since there is so much to do! for",

          "Used metro to Tibidabo station and planned to take trolley to funicular but it wasn\u2019t running- may be seasonal. Instead, we walked uphill to trailhead shortcut and hiked to the funicular. At the top, the city views got more spectacular with each level you ascend. It was very",
          "Took Hop on/off to city bus. Caught it just past trolley stop. Then took funicular up. It was surreal having a beautiful church high up on hill overlooking barcelona surrounded by an amusement park! Gift shops available. Beer and wine and food available.",
          "Tibidabo fair is different. It's full of old but restored atractions. Like a one hundred years ago fair but modernized. The main attraction? many but I love Krugger hotel (scary dark freddy krueger hotel visit with real actors inside, jeje), the atalaya (simple but with amazing",
          "Our kids are 3 and 1. Although there was hardly anything for my younger one, our older son loved the park. There were at least 5-6 rides for his age. And he loved the slides and playgrounds and trampolines. Will definitely re-visit when they are older. Pity the park was only",

          "Took forever to get up there! Packed full of school kids. Nothing special. Good for photographs from the top over looking Barcelona.",
          "Fromt the church to the amusement park, the whole thing is pretty darned tacky. That said, the views are amazing and it's totally worth paying the 3.50 Euros to take the elevator go to the top of the church - you basically end up at the feet of the statue of Jesus at the top",
          "Beside church and train ride this has a wonderful restaurant and a fabulous view of city. They made good special veg lasania for us Took good care must go to this restaurant",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to Tibidabo, walked up to catch the Funicular which was fun and reasonably priced. Once up at the top the views I am sure are spectacular we were unlucky with the weather a low cloud cover. Recommend to anyone visiting the area",
          "Beautiful church in the mountains. It\u2019s quite small inside but you can take a lift up to the rooftops and the view is amazing. Worth visiting!",
          "This chuch is on a top of a hill and you can see this building at alms everywhere in BCN city center. I was wondering what this building is, so I planned to come there. There was calm and cozy church and inside the church, there was a lift to the top. I forgot the fare but the",

          "The view is fantastic but the rest is rather disappointing . The tram was great but the \u201camusement \u201c park at the top is just pathetic. You can say you visited Barcelona without going to Tibidabo. Trust me.",

          "I agree with the reviewrs here, this is a spectacular place to have a view of Barcelona view. Besides, there are Fun rides for kids and a historic church to visit. Getting there is also quite an experience, not to be missed if you are in this city.",

          "Amazing views of the whole of Barcelona. Quite a journey to get there. Metro, walk and funicular. Don't forget your camera! I did find the small amusement park at the top slightly odd.... Plenty of places to eat and drink.",
          "Fabulous views of the city from this hilltop church. Well worth visiting and an adventure getting there via tube, train, funicular and bus!",
          "Well worth visiting even just for the views. We didn't do anything other than sit with a drink and look at the view and it was worth the time.",
          "Visited here as part of a Thomson organised day excursion from our holiday resort in La Pineda and was wealth worth the money. The views from the top are amazing and you can see right over the whole city of Barcelona. The churches are lovely especially inside. I am not at all",
          "Tibidabo was beautiful and the views of Barcelona were amazing. I am not religious, but the church is pretty spectacular! It is so big and beautiful, inside and out. Yes, there is a small amusement park up there as well, but it was there before the church, and it is kind of cool",
          "Park is located in beautiful place, on the top of the Tibidado hill, where you can admire Barcelona from the 518 metres above sea level. But entrance to Park costs 28 euro per adult and attractions are mostly for children, so I do not recommend to enter in. You can see views of",
          "Try and plan this into your trip, nit the easiest of places to get too, but well worth making the effort, beautiful views of the city",
          "It is an amusement park in the city. Old and new at the same time. Breath taking views. Take one full day to enjoy all the rides and the views. If summer drink lots of water.",
          "Who puts a ferras wheel and amusement park beside such an incredible church?! I'm not religious by any sense, however to turn such an amazing structure and location into a 'tourist trap' is so disrespectful.",
          "Had a free afternoon and evening with my kids while we were in Barcelona. Went to Tibidabo with kids ages 12, 9 and 7. Great fun for all of us. The views are outstanding especially from the top of the tallest ride. The roller coaster was pretty tame but fun enough for a short",
          "you have not eaten Churros until you eat Churros is Tibidabo, they are simply GREAT. The theme park is so much fun with amazing rides, Vintage meets new . The ride all the way to Tibidabo is fun and interesting. Bus , Tram, walk .... it is an experience.",
          "We bought tickets to Panoramic part of this park and this was excellent! Magnificent views of Barcelona, sometimes some sharp feelings as well. The museum of automats, however, was a single disappointment, as many things just stand still, despite the fact that in theory you",
          "The church is wonderful and scenery from terrace great. Best route is bus T2A from Plaza Catalunya. If you want you can also access the amusement park at the same time.",
          "I arrived to tibidabo by using Hop on hop off the red line bus services, they drop you at a place where you take a tram - you have to pay for a tram you reach a place really up in the mountain and again you need to take a cable car REALLY UP UP in the mountain - the view is so",
          "You can see all Barcelona from here!!! Great attractions and a view you will never forget!!!! It is a must!",
          "Visited this location and was blown away by the views over Barcelona. It is very easy to get there, metro, bus and the the funicular to the top. Lovely church with a statue of our Lord on the top. This I understand makes it the highest point in the city. Plenty to do even if",
          "This makes a nice half day trip out. You can take the old \"Tramvia Blau\" (which is very vintage and costs 5EUR) and then the funicular (7 EUR return) up to the top where there is a spectacular church (3EUR entry), small theme park with vintgae amusements and an amzing view",
          "We went to tibidabo and we went on this super cool roller coaster with these amazing VR goggles and you could see super cool things even though there is no drops",
          "There were four of us on this trip up to Tibidabo and what a exciting trip it was. We started on the hop on hop off bus then we then took the tram after that we took the funicular railway to the top these do have a charge but its well worth it the views of Barcelona that spread",
          "A bit expensive for a family of 4 (about 100\u20ac) but we did have a good day despite many of the park attractions being pretty old. Great views of city to enjoy while resting. Ticket booths at entrance to top level but you don't have to buy them unless going to lower levels where",
          "I Highly recommend to visit this place. Go there using the step gradient train, and so avoiding getting lost or parking problems. Once there you will have a stunning view of Barcelona. Try to choose a clear day, otherwise visibility can be restricted. And obviously there are",
          "On my childhood I have been there many times, now with child I try to repeat everytime I visit Barcelona, and still like it a lot. Is not Portaventura or Eurodisney, is a city park on the top of the highest mountain in Barcelona, some old attractions, carrousels, some roller",
          "Visited Barcelona for the first time and stayed in a lovely hotel near the university areas. Speaking to the locals we were advised to use the train service rather then taxi and when we asked all the local what do they do on their days off young and old all said we go to \"",
          "I'm sure there is a lot more to do here than what we did but the amazing views of the city are well worth it. You can take a cab up to where they have a tram that will take you to the top. There are some rides up there and food/drink available. You can see practically the entire",
          "I wanted to visit this park ever since I saw pictures of the beautiful coloured Ferris wheel! So we made the very long and complicated journey up the hill and it was so worth it. We had to get a bus into the centre from Park Guell, then the metro, then we boarded the funicular",
          "Well worth the trip up on the funicular railway to this lovely spot overlooking Barcelona. You can climb to the top of the church for the most amazing views of the city. There is a small fun fair and somewhere to get refreshments",
          "Best place for watching the sunset, Best place for kids have fun with amusement park, best place for panoramic view, best place for picnic. Must visit, when you in Barcelona.",
          "Recently visited Barcelona with my young son and wanted a day out for us to enjoy together. I had previously lived in the city but never visited this. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this and we both had a great day out. Perfect for families with young and teenage",

Hot weather with cold beers and amazing view!Just fascinated!!! Take your jacket with you very windy !!! Highly",
          "I took a train, funicular, and a bus to reach there, so it did take me quite some time. The view from the church is nice and cool. But there are not that much to see in the area, just the church and the amazement park. If you have time, it's nice to go. You can spot the church",
          "We didn't hear about Tibidabo until i heard it on the audio guide while on bus turistico hop on hop off bus. We just decided to get off the bus and try the old tram and the furnicula to get up to Tibidabo even though we don't lnow whats instore for us on top. But the trip was",
          "Tibidabo is a - must visit in Barcelona. The view from top of the beautiful church is unbeatable. (Also, it's good to know that you can get there with public transportation with T-10 ticket)",
          "There is great view from this place, but it is small and unless you are with children who try different kinds of attractions, there is nothing much to do there. Also, if you go up with bus or taxi, and only want to take tram down, you shall have to pay two way full price, as",
          "I spotted this church from the roof-terrace of the Barca Ravel hotel in Barcelona, I was determined to get there. It took 2 tube trains, a vernicular train and a bus ride, but we got there, It took about 1 and a half hours and was well worth it just for the view. The",
          "Get excellent views of Barcelona and a diffferent familiy activity you can do during the day. It seems to me a great park to spend the day. Don't expect adrenaline rides, kind of Port Aventura Dragon's Khan rolllercoaster, but the offer is pretty decent, family experience.",
          "This is a must place to visit in Barcelona. The view from top is awesome. The rides and the food is also great. A good one day to spend.",
          "Tibidabo ( Barcelona ) , Europark ( Rust) and Disneyland Paris Theme Parks Written By : Ameer AlSaleh So many visitors and tourists to Europe and more specifically, Spain and Germany have had never heard of a theme park as Disneyland Paris. Subsequently, family leaders do",
          "And also good for enjoying the view over Barcelona. Not so great food available in the zone. Also visit the church.",
          "Recommend for kids and for the view. The interactive fontains are very nice. Not si great food available in the zone.",
          "It might be because this place is on the outskirts of the city, or cumbersome to get to or that people get distracted by the amusement park next door; whatever the reason, do not miss out on visiting the Temple Tibidabo. A hidden secret is the EUR3.50 lift all the way to the top",
          "Pay attention to the beautiful mosaics on the walls If you have problems with walking or beware heights, don't go to the top by stars. The lift is taking up only to the certain level.",

          "I never thought that this place is Amazing! I took a metro from the city to Tibidabo and from there you can go to the top in two ways: by bus or by this tram - I took tram which cost around 5euros for 1 way (this will give you 1eur off the return ticket). If you want to",
          "I've been there a couple of times when I was younger. Thus time I went with my fiance. We both loved it. A very enjoyable day, with a lot to do. Will definitely be back when back in Barcelona.",
          "Take the kids up on the bus or the funicular too for extra excitement. Great for very young children and older kids too. Rides, play park and splash parks.l, something for all. Restaurants are generally very good, not extortionately priced and a great mix of fresh healthy food",
          "After reading the reviews I was expecting long queues and everything being over priced. We took our own food (subway from Las Ramblas), took the T2a bus at the top of Las Ramblas, off the far left corner (3 euros each). The views from the various platforms, church and ride are",
          "The cathedral is amazing with it's view of barcelona. It's funny that a whole amusementparc is build all around the cathedral. There is hidden trail through the valley from the amusementaparc that gets you in city center within 20min...very interesting with a little forest in",
          "We are two adults and we both loved it. Wonderful view to begin with. Enough attractions for grown-ups. I enjoyed the house of mirrors, swing ride, roller coaster. But I loved the virtual reality train ride. If only I had known about it earlier, I would have taken the train as",
          "It takes some time to get there - first we took a train L3 till Tibidabo , then walked uphill for approx. 20 min (you can take a bus or a tram instead, but we just love walking). Then it was funicular which costs 7.70 euros both ways. It all was totally worth the view. To enter",
          "The actual church on the hill is reasonably interesting and the views are quite impressive, however...... This review is not about the church and view, it is about the transport. Oh yes, a very pretty little blue tram, but circa 5 euros each to go up the hill BUT also circa 5",

          "This small themepark high in the mountains of Barcelona is a lot of fun for the whole familie. This park also has one of the best views of the city. And the journey to the park can be a lot of fun to, with the historic blue tram and the cablecar.",
          "After an interesting journey there via the tourist bus, the tram and funicular we arrived at what could best be described as an old fashioned fun fair. The children thoroughly enjoyed the carousel, the dodgem cars and all of the rides. The restaurant prices were reasonable and",
          "A great day out. We didn't expect alot from this park but we had so much fun. It's fun for all ages, some of the rides have awesome views over Barcelona. We payed almost 50\u20ac for 2 persons and got green bracelets which means that you can take all of the rides including the bus",
          "Awesome panoramic views of Barcelona, definitely worth the drive up. We enjoyed taking the elevator up to the roof of the church and taking in the views. Good use of 1-2 hours. The place is much less touristy than other attractions in Barcelona which makes it ideal for photos!",
          "We got there by underground, a fabulous little 1920's restored tram and the funicular and it really was worth it for the spectacular views from the top - they really are breathtaking",
          "Go all the way to the top! Great views of the city and a truly magical place except for the small theme park which we avoided.",
          "Bus trip. Then \u20ac15.90 for3 to go on tram one way. Catch a taxi back down cheaper. . Then got off to find you had to pay again \u20ac7 each to catch the lift up to the top. Or \u20ac27 to enter top and access to the fun fair.",
          "Have visited the park twice already and it will certainly be a must go every time I'm in Barcelona! I absolutely love the church and the amusement park, always have tons of fun, highly recommend!",
          "We took our 16 year old daughter with us to the amusement park and had a great day out. The top layer of rides are the oldest traditional rides with amazing views of Barcelona. The lower levels are more up to date with a rollercoaster, log flume etc. The rides range from being",
          "We took an old outdated train to the top ; it was a great experience to visit Tibidabo! We had a quick aperitif but I realised later that there is a self serve restaurant just 200 metres away!",
          "Slight parking problem on Saturday noon, but once you get there, it worth while. Been only at the Panoramic area. Amazing view of the city. Ferris wheel was superb.",
          "If you do not catch the tram up, it is quite a hike to the funicular! Once at the top, the views are beautiful, and the cathedral is great. You can take the steps to the top of the church for a better view. Good place for kids since there is an amusement park at the top.",
          "Nice place in an unusual setting Good for young children 15 years tops Food very expensive and mediocre Use busses from down town or metro avoid blue tram rip off",
          "If you fancy lung cancer for your kids Tibidabo is a great place. People are smoking shamelessly every where EVEN on the kids areas. Needless to say the staff does nothing to stop this even thou it is prohibited. Complaining about this does nothing either they just don\u2019t seem",
          "Great view from the top, but besides that and church that is interesting only from the outside, I did not find too much to do there. Unless you are into attraction park. Then it's a place for you.",
          "I've been there three times. If you want to go there the touristic way you can use the tranv\u00eda blau and the funicular, but it is expensive. If you only want to go to the park of attractions you can also use the tibibus from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. However, it is really nice to take a",
          "The first part of our visit to Tibidabo was getting there. You can take the bus, drive or use public transportation. We used the public transit route that included both the blue trolley and the funicular. We took the L7 metro from Plaza Catalunya to the last stop, Av.",
          "Take a funicular to get to the Tibidabo mountain. You can buy tickets to the whole day at Tibidabo Amusement Park, which are quite expensive, or you can actually buy separate tickets to the amusements that you really wanna try, this will cost much cheaper for you. There is",
          "Really beautiful scenery on the top of Tibidabo mountain with this nice and original park with multiple attractions in different levels for the whole family.",
          "This year (July 2017) we went to Tibidabo for the second time. Our kids are 4 n 6 yo. Besides that, we couldn't spend too much money. That is why we chose for the Top area (Panorama) which allows you to go to all attractions on the 6th floor (the top one) plus the museum. It is",
          "I saw this theme park on the film Vicky Christina Barcelona years ago and have been wanting to visit ever since! We bought the cheaper panoramic ticket which allows you to go on all the rides on level 5 (highest level) of the theme park. As we got the bus to the park we got a",

          "It is a bit expensive, considering the amount of rides. The tube costs extra as well. In my opinion, the awesome roller coaster alone is worth the effort and money :)",
          "We weren't going to do this but decided at the last minute to make the trek. And we didn't regret it. We took the bus up to the old trolley stop (which tickets for the trolley are pricey, but we wanted for full experience) and then from there we took the tram up the mountain the",
          "This is a great place to go late in the afternoon and stay into the evening to get the best daytime and nighttime views of the city. A strange juxtaposition of a church and amusement park, but just enjoy it.",
          "We went to Barcelona for the first time and were looking for attractions for children. The Tibidabo Park was the most wonderful place to have fun! We spent the whole day and the kids didn't want to leave! Take a taxi to go up there and by the end of the day take a bus to get",
          "A must go place! Incredible views of Barcelona from the top. The amusement park seems family-friendly. Definitely visiting Barcelona is not complete without going there.",
          "The view is just excellent! Basilica is really nice as well, it is really a peaceful place... I don't really get the idea of amusement park, but for families and kids it has to be fun... If you are in Barcelona for the first time and staying just for a few days, skip it... there",
          "So I just wanted to take the kids to the top level to do a couple rides overlooking Barcelona. We drove up Tibidabo and parked in the amusement park garage which is on the lowest level. Didn't realize the Amusement park had the other levels. We paid for the entire park to",
          "We could see that we wanted to go here from the first day we arrived in Barcelona. It did not disappoint.",
          "It was a beautiful church, but I think it was a little bit weird with the amusement park around the church.",
          "While in Barcelona my friend and I wanted to take in the best view, as we had done in all other stops of our European vacation. This IS the place to go. Upon arrival, I hadn't known there was a theme park attached to this site. We arrived and were initially confused but walked",
          "The church is beautiful and the views outstanding. Our guide gave us history of the church and is not favored by the locals. We had a snack there and then left to find a remote restaurant that the guide knew.",
          "You really have to arrive early .. possibly by 10.00 to be able to get tickets and move between the different rides. The park is full of rides beautifully designed and appealing to the taste of the adventurer and the not much. The scare hotel is not to be missed and their tapid",
          "My family had an extremely poor experience here, mainly due to bad customer service and inconsistent standards. First, be aware that if you're taking public transport, it's a bit of journey. You have to take a train out to the area, then take the blue tram (overpriced tourist",
          "This place has an incredible view of Barcelona. It is amazing. You have to get in a train to get there. The amusement park was very fun. I loved every part of this place.",
          "This is mainly a kids amusement park parked high on a hill overlooking Barcelona. Go for the views and the Cathedral, and the Olympic Comms tower. You can also travel by Historic Blue Tram, and a funicular railway. The journey is as much fun as the destination.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our day up at Tibidabo. The trains were a real treat and added to the experience immensely. The vintage amusement are expensive but I would say very worth while if travelling with children",
          "The views are amazing. It was a little odd having an amusement park at the foot of a church! The church, Sagrat Cor, is definitely worth a visit. We took the blue tram up, plus the funicular up and down, but instead of paying for the tram down, we walked and it was an easy 20",
          "If you want a rather breathtaking view of Barceolna it is worth the visit. Be physically prepared if you intend to climb there. It is not that easy to reach it. There is a tram going up to the main view. (7.5\u20ac valid both ways) until then I think you can get a bus, we went on",
          "This isn't the greatest amusement park you will visit but the one with the most character and the best location. Given the prices of some of the iconic attractions in Barcelona this is actually very affordable. It is not overcrowded, has enough diversity, long opening hours,",
          "It is not easy to get there unless you take a taxi all the way up. If you want to take your time, they have a funicular which takes you up the mountain. It was quite enjoyable. At the top, the Cathedral is spectacular and the views match. The amusement park is an interesting",
          "We took our kids (3+5) here for a super fun vacation day. It was saturday but the wait to get into the rides wasnt bad. Lots and lots of fun things to do and see. And the view is amazing!!!!",
          "I really visited to see Sagrat Cor church and the view but had two tickets for rides so I went on the Ferris Wheel to see the city. I can see if I had younger children this would be a fun place to visit. However, even for older adults, there are some classic rides that enhance",
          "I wanted so badly to visit the last time in Barcelona that visiting was a priority. According to Barcelonans this is the mountain on which the devil tempted Jesus and after seeing the view, I understand why. The view is only part of the reason to visit. In addition you have",
          "I find it weird it is next to an amusement park - the visit was enjoyable but nothing to write home about especially considering that its not the easiest place in the world to get to.",
          "Go to Tibidabo for the views and the church NOT the amusement park. We had a hop on hop off bus ticket so rode the bus as far as the Blue tram. The tram takes you about half way up the mountain and costs \u20ac5. It is well worth the cost as it's a long way. We decided to walk back",
          "A Heavenly Veiw of Barcelona. Not far from the city centre, 15 minutes by car. Good place to look from above",
          "Wonderful small amusement park, with incredible views! I think kids over 12 might want something with bigger, faster rides, but out 8 y/o and 6 y/o were thrilled! *Note: Kids' pricing is by Height, NOT Age. Under 90cm and under 120cm enjoy reduced pricing. They won't be able to",
          "Definitely worth the trip up here. Keep a few pennys spare. Use the metro to get to the bottom of the mountain, then use the tram to get half way and the funicular the rest of the way up. I would reocmmend using all the methods on the way back down as it is a long steep walk",
          "The exterior of the church is very beautiful. The interior of the church is not so impressive. The scenery is very very beautiful, seeing all of Barcelona below. We arrive by metro and then a kind of cable car and then by bus. It takes about an hour to arrive. In a day of good",
          "We decided to visit this place because there was no tickets in Gaudi park and Tibidabo was next destination by tour bus. And we was not disappointed. It was the best view to Barcelona. Myself and my boyfriend were amazed. Also, the old Emusement Park on top. Catedral is",
          "Very different. Not to easy to get to but different that Park Guell, this one has transportation to take you to the top of the mountain. A little expensive because you have to pay to get to the place where you take the tranvia, then you have to pay for the tranvia and last you",
          "I had really high hopes for Tibidabo and unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. I imagine if you had young children and you wanted to keep them occupied for a couple of hours this is the place for you. What I didn't realise is that there is actually an amusement",
          "this is one of the places which should be in your list. its a different face for Barcelona. very calm and relaxing spot. however there's a small adventure park with 4 or 5 games the best one is only for 2 euros and you can see all Barcelona from the top. there's a special train",
          "It is definitely worth making the trip up the mountain, the views are spectacular. Not the easiest place to get to, we used the hop-on-hop-off bus and from the closest stop caught the local bus to the top of the hill (although there was a tram but it was slower and alot more",
          "Tibidabo has the best views over Barcelona out of all the places we visited! I would recommend this to all. It sits perched up on a hill over looking the city, and is a great get-away from all the crowds in the inner city. Take the elevator to the top of the church for the best",
          "Fantastic view of Barcelona and the surrounding area. The church is beautiful. You can get to the top of the church for just \u20ac3.50, and the view from the top makes it completely worth it. Easy to get to by public transport (bus 111) - there is no need to go via the tram which",
          "Visited here after a recommendation. Glad we made the trip. I thought this was going to be just another church. It was that and more. The views from the top are unrivaled in Barcelona. It was fun hiking all the stairs to,the top of the church. This has a breathtaking view of",
          "Do not take the tram. It is way too expensive and not necessary. I would recommend to take public transportation which takes you right to the top of the mountain in a bus.",
          "It\u00b4s a nice trip to go up to Tibidabo. First go to Avenida Tibidabo, Placa Kennedy with L7 from placa Catalunia and then take Tramvia Blau opposite the placa. At last take the funicular to the top.",
          "Seriously underrated part of the city, tram and gondola were so easy to find, amazing views of all of Barcelona. Would recommend to make this part of your itinerary when you visit",
          "Coolest place to see the entire city - top of the mountain. We took bus T2A that takes you directly to the top (from Placa Catalunya, in front of Desigual store). From where the bus leaves you walk around 5min to get to the view place. There is also an amusement park. To get",
          "Tibidabo is the highest point in Barcelona; it has a beautiful church on top of it. The views are spectacular from the main plaza, and you can still go up two stories to the church plaza for more views. You can get there by bus or tram & funicular -- READ UP ON THESE, BE",
          "We had a very nice time on the Tibidabo mountain. If you don't want to walk a lot uphill you can take the blue tram that will take you to the funicular (the ticket is around 7 euro) which drives you directly on the top. You can enjoy an amazing view of Barcelona from the top of",
          "The view is absolutely spetacular, especially from the tower of the church. There isn't a lot of space in the tower, two relatively thin people get past each other, but for others this might be a bit difficult. There is also some stair-climbing involved to get to the top.",
          "Good for all the family. Rollercoaster, log flume and Big Wheel. Fantastic views of the city form this park as well.",
          "Si est\u00e1s en Barcelona es muy recomendable acercarse a pasar un d\u00eda entero o unas horas en el parque de atracciones del Tibidabo.

          "Tibidabo is ideal to spend a day with the whole family, specially is you have young children. Attractions available for all the family. I totally recommend it. If you're planning to go 2-3 times per year, then the annual pass (Tibi Club) is the best option",
          "We went here for the amazing view. It ended up being very foggy and that made for a very special experience. See photos. The iconic church make for contrast with the rather tacky amusement park. Perfect for photography.",
          "How you enjoy this place will depend on your age and outlook. The views from the Church are stunning and the stone carvings are incredible. The amusement park has to sections one for younger children and the other for older dare devils. Having a younger child we didn't get to",
          "There are plenty of ways to get great views in Barcelona (such as Montjuic) but this is one of the best. It is usually busy in the Summer but that shouldn't be surprising for a theme park. The park definitely caters towards family more than thrill seekers, but there is still a",
          "This was a stop on the hop on, hop off bus tourista. So glad we got off here. The tram ride and then funicular to the top was a fun experience on its own. Once at the top, the views are spectacular. The vintage amusement park is delightful and the church wonderful to see. We",

          "Although there are other ways to get to the top of this mountain, the funicular railway is probably the quickest and probably worth the high price to use it. The church at the top is very pretty and is very peaceful and cool inside. The views across the city are by far the best",

          "Take the trolley up then the funicular to the top. The view is absolutely amazing. You see the whole city, sea, mountains. Watch for the mansions on the way up the road. Exquisite. Then the church on top. It brings tears to your eyes. Take the bus down- it's much less",
          "Easily one of the most unique amusement parks! The park is a short tram ride from the center of town and it offers an amazing view of the city and countryside. We went in the afternoon and the rides are available either individually or as an all day pass.",
          "I recommend going there for the view. We did not have time to go to the amusement park but we had lunch at the restaurant outside. It is really easy to take a train up there. We took the taxi up and then the train down hill.",
          "Stumbled upon a picture of the church on instagram and thought it looked amazing. Was pleasantly surprised after a trip to parc guell that it would only cost 14 euros in a taxi to get up to the top of the mountain. Once there, the views are amazing, much better than what the",

          "I had never even heard of thes place and was reluctant to go because they charge so much to ride the street trolley to the top. A city bus is more affordable, but I wasn't aware of that until after our visit. The cute little hippy style bus tram takes you up the side of a",
          "This is a rather small amusement park and really not that many rides. I was there with my teenage daughter and we did go on a few rides and had great fun. The views from the ferris wheel are spectacular and so was the ride in the mountain roller coaster.",
          "The drive up to the mountain was beautiful. Steep mountain road surrounded by trees and beautiful panoramic views of Barcelona. At the top stands a stunning church.",
          "High, high above Barcelona, visible from just about everywhere, it has a nice church, but it is the views of the Barcelona region that are captivating. There is also a children's park which might ease the strains on a family visit.",

          "You can get the tram and train but from what I understood it was quite pricy, I just went to the centre and caught a bus from there for something like \u20ac4 euros each way. It's a must visit with some incredible views of the city....",

          "We spent \u20ac5.50 per person on the tram and then another \u20ac7.50 per person for the funicular. That was just for the view and then church. Anything else cost more. To go to the top of the church is another \u20ac3.50, but it is not needed as the views from the park are spectacular as is.",

          "A statue of Jesus on the cathedral (weak architecture) overlooking an amusement part, it's a bit weird, had to think of the Don Bosco paintings in the Prado. For art lovers, they understand this remark. The antenna from Norman Foster is impressive, and great architecture. Trip",

Every ride was 1+ hours waiting time and it became exhausting and not enjoyable. I think they need to decrease their numbers that they let in.",

          "Lively theme park to go to in Barcelona, amazing views from the very top of it.",
          "Amazing. There are 2 Cathedral one over other. The view is fantastic.",
          "Amazing place. Beautiful views! Genius who thought of view point rides on top of a hill! You can buy solo tickets for \u20ac2 for the rides instead of having to buy a pass if you only want to go on one or two rides.",
          "Nice place to go with family for a half day trip...make sure to check the timings of opening and closing before going",
          "It's very beautiful place with the best view, i think anyone has ever seen. it's not a place with wild and big roller coasters. It's totally worth the money for both a child with some good child roller coasters and for an adult with the \u2026",
          "Weird religious mini Disney land on a mountain. Beautiful",
          "Queues a little long for some attractions and expensive at \u20ac28. The food isn't great. Otherwise a good pace to visit. Transportation was excellent and covered by a T10 ticket. The views of the city are amazing. If I was to visit again I would go just for the views and skip the amusement park",
          "Check it out.  Nice view.  Did not enter the park.  The church in the hilltop is nice",
          "Great views of Madrid from above. Not 100% sure if worth the drive through town and up the hill to see it but was neat to see a different perspective of Madrid from the top.",
          "Amazing amusement park. More for kida then adults but still had a lot of fun. No scary rides..maybe just a bit the rollercoaster. Best views of Barcelona",
          "The park is nice for children. They music and games for the kids and you get a wonderful view of the city. The lines can get long for the rides. It is best to give your self more time in the park if members of your family looking to get on rides.",
          "Amazing views and a good day out if you have plenty time in Barcelona. Food was reasonably priced and tasty but drinks expensive. Many of the food outlets were closed which surprised me in the height of summer. My daughter is just below one \u2026",
          "The view of Barcelona is amazing, but other than that it feels like a small town amusement park from the mid 80's.\nI believe Barcelona deserves something (much) better.",
          "As a first timer that had 4 days in Barcelona, I went and it was well worth it. Would have been worth it even if I only had single day. Views up At the top are amazing where I felt peace and rejuvenated. Worth every minute I spent and I dedicated 2+ hours.",
          "Great place to spend some time with family or friends. Easy to reach by bus from the Placa Catalu\u00f1a.",
          "A tourist trap, a mix of low grade carnival rides and a .... church? sure the views are great but you'll get the same views from Parc Guell and at least that place is legitimately and originally beautiful. I'd skip if this is your first time in Barcelona.",
          "One of the best places in Barcelona! Should go there before sunset to get the perfect view",
          "The best thing about this place is the location. The amazing view of the city you get from several of the attractions is breathtaking. Very good for photographing and enjoying. The attractions are okay. Some good, some old and some news. \u2026",
          "Great view from the top of a mountain near Barcelona. Very good for pictures. There are spaces for picnic and many parts for kids for free. Only some parts (adventures ones) demand ticket.",
          "The views we're amazing, though the park was closed for the winter",
          "Panoramic views of Barcelona and an amusement and aqua parc ! I love hiking here from the last metro stops!",
          "Views are amazing. If you can help it, don't pay the \u20ac28.50 for the amusement park, and instead pay the \u20ac3.50 to go to the top of the church. It's worth it. The amusement park takes away from the awe-inspiring architecture.",
          "Super amusement park that is over 100 years old. There are rides for all ages. It offers a superb view of Barcelona and the cathedral is magnificent.  To do.",
          "Cool place with great views. Better if you are traveling with kids.",
          "Great view on Barcelona. I really recommend to visit it if you're in the city.",
          "Small but fun. Great view of Barcelona and surrounding areas.",
          "It was a nice view point for sunset and panoramic view of the city.",
          "We couldn't go to the actual parc since it only opens on March 7. Most other rides were closed due to the wind.",
          "Unfortunately \u00e0 bit cloudy when we came and the theme park was closed. But otherwise I imagine it'd be a great place!",
          "Very nice place for tourist and for local people to spend Sunday and enjoy the views to Barcelona city",
          "Really great fun for a day out. Being able to mix the culture of the church with the fun of the amusement park was really great and the views from the top of the mountain really can't be beaten. I thoroughly recommend the watchtower for great views of the church exterior and over the city towards the ocean.",
          "Amazing ! From the church terrace, you get beautiful views of the city and nearby amusement park. The church from the outside looks majestic. It is a must visit on a trip to Barcelona!",
          "The best amusement park I have ever been too.\n Just be aware of the thieves that robbed myself & girlfriend of our gold chains & money .\nOccurring near the bus stop under the trees. It unfortunately is a regular occupation during summer \u2026",
          "Overpriced, boring attractions. Only special because of the view (which is spectacular). Staff not friendly. Save the money and just buy a ticket to the top without the theme park included. Maybe nice for little children, but not older than 12.",
          "Beautiful church inside this park, however costs money to go right to the top, the tickets for the bus and the day there worked out to just over 25\u20ac each. The park is build in 5 floors, obviously mainly for kids but we had loads of fun, \u2026",
          "So we were backpacking through Eastern Europe, just outside of Barcelona, climbing the foothills of mount Tibidabo.... couldn't find a lake \ud83e\udd23\nWell worth the hike for the story and the amazing view.",
          "it is  a good place to your kids  and  so very nice place to stay and relax",
          "Super fun and some of the rides allow for unique pictures. Would hop on a few for an experience.",
          "Access Funicular shut. Access tram shut. Alternative transport provision /information 0.00, Brilliant",
          "This is a very iconic, adorable and beautiful place in fantastic Barcelona. Sure you have big lines to get there and the entrance ticket is not necessarily cheap, but it's totally worth it. The view is stunning, the church is also gorgeous. \u2026",
          "it's a very nice place . you can see  Barcelona skyline from there . the travel is fun when you use the public transport",
          "Wow awesome thanks God Jesus Christ is alive",
          "Breathtaking view. highly recommend. Few minutes by funicular and you are in the top of the city",
          "I loved this place.\nThe park is perfect for families with children and for primary school groups.\nAmazing view of Barcelona.\nIf you like high quotes, you can visit even the terrace just below Jesus Crist.",
          "The Hotel next door has 12 star food, well worth going there for lunch or dinner.\n\nThe church fantastic, and the amusement park good fun.",
          "Excelent place to visit for o short holiday in Barcelona, for kids is heaven on earth but there are also museums and fun riders for adults.",
          "The view from the top is quite spectacular. You can see all of Barcelona from up there. There is also a nice looking church and attractions.",
          "Really nice atmosphere, beautiful scenery and a lot of things to do",
          "Very nice place. Good wiev",
          "Nice park, mostly for younger kids. We have the Tibiclub card for the whole family and can go whenever we want. Queques are not too long.",
          "Great place to visit in Barcelona. Amazing panoramic view",
          "Great views from the top of Barcelona. Definitely recommend for a brilliant panoramic of the city.\n\nThe funicular up is a little disappointing as it's covered in graffiti (even most of the windows!) So you don't get the view when travelling up and down in most of the carriages- bit shame!",
          "It worth to go just for the view. But there is no public transport and you have to pay 3 euros per way. Nothing special anyway... Too tourist",
          "Fantastic views of the city and lovely artistry on the church halls",
          "It is great that you can enter it and walk around for free. You only need the ticket if you want to use the rides. The prices for children are also pretty low. Sadly the Funicular (\"train\") did not work so we had a pretty ruff hike to the top.",
          "Unless you go weekends, and certain days of the week, you won't be able to ride all attractions as they are not open.",
          "Love this place for the view! Slow service.",
          "Love it beautiful place specially to go whit the family",
          "This offers unparalleled views of Barcelona.  Climb the church tower for a few dollars and you'll certainly feel on top of th e world. Aside from that, the park is also entertaining especially for the young.  There's lack of exhilarating rides for the thrill seekers. Kids friendly..",
          "A beautiful church and a great view of the city. When you take entrance pass, they are it 2 types. One with just enterance and other with access to the theme park..so decide accordingly",
          "its worth going up there and see the city",
          "The place I go first when visited Barcelona. Amazing views on the city. Didnt have a good weather but the place still nr1 to visit in Barcelona",
          "Tibidabo is always a yes! Either you are looking for fun and excitement, learning about arquitecture and history of the place, or just to enjoy fresh air and majestic views.  The access to tibidabo is easy from plaza Catalu\u00f1a on the \u2026",
          "A must see in Barcelona. The church built on the top of the highest mountain, Tibidabo.\nYou can see the whole Barcelona from there. It's a beautiful view point.\nAlso, visit the park of guell , house of the famous Antoni Gaudi is located there.",
          "Grey place to spend a few hours.  About 1.5hrs is enough if you are a couple.  Maybe 3hrs if you have kids as there is an attraction park there as well.",
          "A lot of activities, the view is breathtaking! Definitely not orth a visit!",
          "Visited at midday and the view from up there is breathtaking. I bet that during the evening it will be even better",
          "Facilities for children, rising really slowly, a scary road but it has a beautiful view, nothing too special.",
          "Great view, but the atraction are from 20year a go!",
          "It's a must visit while you are in Barcelona. Although small but there are a lot of things to do for both adults and kids. It's like a mini Six flag park but more fun and very cheap. The kids will not be disappointed about the unlimited rides they can enjoy plus the Cathedral offer an exceptional view of the whole city of Barcelona.",
          "Breathtaking view of whole city from this spot! The cathedral is a story of its own, and there is an amusement park right next to it which makes it fun for kids to visit too. Take the old funicular to the top to enrich your experience from the visit.",
          "Worth visiting just before the dusk \u2014 you'll encounter less people and get the opportunity to enjoy the city lights",
          "Bit tricky to get to. Beware the T2C bus is only for people with tickets to the amusement park in your planning. Otherwise great view of the city",
          "This should have been the first visit to see the entire city! The best views were from the very top of the basilica.",
          "The view from this place gives you a nice idea of Barcelona views above the city. It's not very popular advertised but it's very nice and a shame to miss it if you are on a city break and you are an avid landscape viewer\ud83d\ude0a we drove over \u2026",
          "Great place for adults and kids to have fun",
          "If you came to Barcelona with your children you should visit here. You have not to buy a ticket for the entrance. I strongly recommend to try ferris wheel and you have not to buy a daily ticket for this.",
          "Beautiful and amazing views, be sure to pick a day that it\u2019s not so busy to visit but either way very beautiful (golden hour might give you the best views if you want some photographs)",
          "Such a great views besides a good amusement park",
          "Park is ok. Churros are delicious. View is incredible.",
          "When you out of ideas and you are in the area, visiting Tibidabo is always a good option for your afternoon. You have restaurant, attractions and , of course the monastery, for the ones in search of other type of relaxation-in fact I find \u2026",
          "A very unlikely, nonetheless spectactular location for a theme park..it is close to the Tibidabo Temple and on a clear day you can see the ocean and Barcelona, which is jaw dropping..the rides are great for kids (there is a restaurant/bar for the adults)",
          "Nice vibe but very tame rides",
          "Great view !! Awesome for kids !!! I went twice I loved so much !! Try to avoid weekends and public holidays if possible as the lines are pretty long !! If you have a disability and have proof you should show the ticket booth when you \u2026",
          "This is a super scenic place, love the views and vintage attractions they have!! It\u2019s a \u201cmust\u201d if you\u2019re around Barcelona !!!",
          "Beautiful place to visit. From this spot you will find one of the best views over Barcelona.",
          "Great place. A Barcelona must",
          "Great location with insane view!",
          "Nice Park and a wonderfull view for free. One minus point. The bus driver, who drive down the hill doesn't accept hola BCN Card. You have to buy an extra ticket in the parc.",
          "Atm out of order, bus takes no cards so you can have a problem",
          "Amazing views of Barcelona... the park hints a little old and needs an update!!!\nBut it's good too see once time!",
          "I love this place , very good for those who has child .",
          "Fun place for kids and amazing views of Barcelona city!",
          "Nice place and the view is awasome \ud83d\udc4c",
          "4 stars mainly for the amazing view over the city.  This is a nice enough park for families, more kids rides than thrills.  They've made an effort to bring it up to date with 1 VR enhanced ride which is ok and a 4d cinemas, but that was \u2026",
          "A beautifully place to be! Really nicr view of Barcelona",
          "Woooah.. this is worth it. This is at hill top. Getting parking at this is tough. Try to go early morning. We walked almost 2km uphill to get at this place. Amazing view fr there.. there a public amusement park with roller coaster and other rides. Caf\u00e9 shop is also available.",
          "Great historical and cheap rides with an astonishing view.",
          "Great view over the whole city, the attractions are cheap so you can enjoy them without worries, can't say the same about the food stands though... if you're in Barcelona on a sunny day, it's definitely worth a visit. About 1 hour from the center in public transport, not bad for what you get",
          "Very nice place. Unclear directions, only in Catalonian. Snacks and drinks are overpriced. Only fast food available. The parking guy talks perfect English, unlike the personal inside the park. The view over Barcelona city is amazing - everyone must see it.",
          "You will find there the best view of Barcelona",
          "The roof of the Bar\u00e7a! Very nice view from there however I think the amusement park doesn't make sense if it's located next to a church. Anyway, a must see place.",
          "Great place for holidays. Amazing view, fresh air and smells.",
          "Amazing place witg breathless views over barcelona. At this time of the year (november on), it can gets really really cold up there (bring some warm clothes if you are planning to stay there until night).\nI went to tibidabo onlu with the \u2026",
          "I love this place the view is smazing",
          "Nice place, but quite far from the city... a great view on Barcelona nevertheless!",
          "It's a fun experience there. It's a rather small park but worth a shot if you are already there and visiting the Church. It's really good for kids and many rides are one for kids.",
          "The most favorite place in town!!!! It\u2019s a must! The entries is a bit overwhelming but totally worthy! Try to hike the mountain, the view is priceless! If you are not a fun of hiking, the public transport takes you up there.",
          "Crazy and wonderful. Fun place with the best Barcelona views",
          "Magic place with astonishing view on Barcelona. The whole city is in your sight. You can just walk and have a rest there, snack (I recommend eating churros) or try some rides. Definetely worth visiting.",
          "Difficult to reach the park. Must be shuttle bus or car parking and they bustards will learn how to attract peaple",
          "Lovely place for a great view on Barcelona. Take the bus and don't forget to pray in the church.",
          "Nice lil theme Park! Great views as well!",
          "Great for kids, reasonably priced, especially tibiclub, great views and great location.",
          "Main attraction is the church and going ontop of it.  If u have time to kill you can go on the rides etc",
          "beautiful panorama, both on the sea and on the mountains, you can see both the sunrise and the sunset, there is also an amusement park for children",
          "Cute little fun fair kind of thing. Brilliant views and awesome how old it's been there",
          "Very beautiful place at the top of the mountain away from the city. A place where everyone will enjoy.",
          "Amusement park from where you can see the tremendous view of Barcelona.",
          "Stuning 360 degree view of the city",
          "Beautiful place!! I loved it, it has the most amazing view of Barcelona",
          "Stunning views and you can get a reasonably priced bite to eat and beer or wine. You don't have to pay just to take in the vistas, only (I think) for the rides. You can take funicular then schlep (a workout) or babble car (extra cost), or \u2026",
          "Nice  view, but long waiting times and slow personal. Attractions closed without advice.  I suggest only to walk through the Park what is for free.",
          "An amazing place with some breathtaking views and landscapes, worth visiting! Try and go there and come back by bike, amazing experience \ud83d\ude01",
          "The place is great and definitelly the great view over Barcelona, highly recomend to visit.\nBUT! To get there is a shuttle bus T2* (the ticket costs 12.70\u20ac) which goes every 30 minutes only. I was at the Bus stop and the driver passed me by \u2026",
          "Visually absolutely stunning, we went for the church more than the rides, and the wraparound views of the coast, but, good rides, check which rides are open on the day before buying your ticket, as a lot were shut",
          "Loved it!!! It has the best view of Barcelona! Don't miss it!!!",
          "Kids play. I suppose it would be great if you where 6-14 years.",
          "Worth checking the view, otherwise it is rather average as an amusement park.",
          "An amazing place to enjoy the view of Barcelona",
          "One great thing about this theme park is that if you pay \u20ac28 you go on all the rides, no exceptions. \nNot a HUGE selection of rides, but enough for nearly a full day.\nQueues are always (in my experience, during summer holidays, daytime) \u2026",
          "Amazing traditional spot in the up town. Have been going there since I didn\u2019t walk and still love it. Last time went on a hike ending there and is an easy nice one to do! Otherwise you can go by various classic teams and cable cars .... \u2026",
          "Fantastic views of Barcelona. The church is pretty impressive too. Amusement park would be good if you like rides.",
          "Long way up cycling and walking but worth it. Great view from the church and a amusement park for kids.",
          "It has a stunning view. A terrific place just to sit and watch people.",
          "Visiting this place on foot walking from Park Guell was quite challenging, but definitely worth experiencing. The view on the city is wonderful. Despite I haven't tried any of the park attraction, I really enjoyed its atmosphere.",
          "A bit undermaintained but nice",
          "So awesome view!!! Public transport works so good...",
          "Amazing view over Barcelona a must visit for every tourist. Easily reachable by car :)",
          "Great journey to get to the park and much surprise and fun for the children.  Also a great view of Barcelona from the top of the basicila.",
          "Beautiful views of the city, along with a fun little amusement park and more modern church. The church isn't as old as some of the sites in barcelona, but it's still a beautiful piece and going to the very top is amazing. The amusement park itself is quite old and the views from the ferris wheel are well worth it.",
          "Nice attraction park in the city but now we\u2019ll organize the line fir many of attractions ..",
          "Very nice place if you have time you should go there.",
          "It's great for kids IF the adults will let them play",
          "For the price and type of rides I think k they charge too much esp for adults. The view is nice. Could have a better variety of food selections.  Also needs more places to sit and eat besides the stadium like seating on top level and about 10-15 booths on lower level.",
          "Great American style bar , the staff was amazing , thank you for a great time . Will visit again .",
          "Great place. Very kids oriented. The only thing is that the lines are very long on August.",
          "Beautiful place to visit on a sunny day. You can see the whole Barcelona city from here. You can get here by car or public transport, if have the energy then hike or bicycle. \n\nYou can go all the way up to the top of statue by stairs. Not for someone with fear of heights.",
          "Great place to jusy hang out",
          "Great location with amazing views.",
          "Wonderful amusement park, some good rides, and the view of Barcelona is simply stunning.",
          "Interesting and a bit confusing park... \ud83d\ude01 Crowded But Nice and good for families with children. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8",
          "We took a lot of time to come. There's not a lot of things to do for adults. We only spent the day coming there. Anyway the view is good",
          "If you have many days in barcelona please go to spend a night here! You'll have a lot of fun between all the plays and the music, festival and all of the party that goes on here almost everyday in summer !",
          "A very beautiful day! If you are looking for perfect date or perfect day with family ... trust me you will find it here",
          "Very nice place to visit with the kids , be prepared to spend most of the day here due to long lines and not really efficient staff's way of work.\n\nIt's much cooler and windy up here than in city center, therefore come prepare.\n\nMost of the \u2026",
          "perfect view on barcelona plus theme park",
          "Will worth the trip just passing for sightseeing pass and then 4 euros extra to go to top of the basilica.",
          "A long trip, but a nice place and a complete view of the city. Go there with the children, but ask info for the quickest trasportation.",
          "Most recommended place to go on Barcelona.",
          "It has gorgeous views of the city from up high on the mountain but the rides aren't that great. Would go up just for the view but wouldn't buy rides tickets again.",
          "Literally everything costs money, and its very crowded. But the view is worth it!",
          "I imagined it very beautiful, but it was not. There are just few things, and according to it's price it is nothing. Liked the fact that you can see the whole Barcellona from the top and nothing else.",
          "Very good place for family visit, my older was really exited and she is only 5\nit is good for adults also, recommend to visit",
          "Amazing place, you should to go there!!!",
          "You don't need to go inside.. You get the extremely good view for free!",
          "A beautiful church with city view",
          "Amazing place. Beatiful top view to Barcelona, open for everyone, the ones with access to the attractions have bracelets.\nAlso you can pay only for the panoramic area attractions.\nMy kids loved!",
          "Amazing\ud83d\ude0dI had so much fun here\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffeTibidabo\ud83d\ude0eIf you haven't been here, you don't (really) know Barcelona",

          "Amazing views of Barcelona and lovely fun fair. Terrific and scary \"Krueger Hotel\" \ud83c\udfe9",
          "So beautiful place I like it",
          "Signage is awful. Hard to determine where to go.\nBeware the bus arrangements. Our tickets got us up the hill, but we had to go back up to a ticket office to get tickets down the hill.",
          "Cool little park with amazing views of Barcelona City",
          "Honestly, come for the views which are free, and the church. Don't bother with the rides. Only 4 were open and the bored looking staff did not always fill them up. For example, the Ferris wheel takes 120 people but was sent off with only 8 \u2026",
          "Nice amusement park. We paid for the funicular ride + emblematic rides, but as we got to top we found that because of the wind, the plane and the big wheel were closed, so consider buying tickets when you get there, as I think there is always wind up there.",
          "The park have both beauty at day time and at night time.gives such a beautiful top view of the city and full moon",
          "Best place to see Barcelona",

          "Great for kids, packed on weekends so weekdays better if possible. Views of Barcelona are just stunning.",
          "Views were great, I didn't go on any rides but they looked like they were good for families. Churros were tasty. We had a good time walking around and taking photos. Pity the funicular and tram were not operating. Paying the 12.50\u20ac for the \u2026",
          "Well worth the short hike up. Amazing view.",
          "Super complicated access for a family. The park is fun and it was cool to go there with our 4yo boy - but it was a nightmare to come back in Barna :(",
          "I have been coming for over 20 years, and it has been ever since one of my favorite childhood memories. Fantastic views from Barcelona city, and very enjoyable park even though is not huge. There are different passes in case you\u2019re not\nA \u2026",
          "The place is magical, having a theme park embedded in a mountain is a totally different experience, the games are very nice for all ages and some of them are making great use of the mountain view. The roller coaster ride is really nice on the edge of the mountain. Totally recommend.",
          "Great place to be. Loads of fun to have.",
          "Great place to spend time with family and friends..amazing panoramic view.",
          "The awesome place, must see",
          "Much better deal than Disneyland",

          "Very nice park with excellent view to the city. The cathedral was also amazing.",
          "Great place to go in family to have fun in the park, the church and see great views of Barcelona. If you like any of my photos and you want to purchase them, you can do it in my website. Link in my instagram pofile's bio (alejandromarquezperezph)",
          "Went there on a closed day. You can still walk around the park and enjoy the views down to the city. The park itself looks rather old and \"worn out\". I would recommend to visit the park. But rather for the view and enjoying a little hike thorough it than for amusement.",
          "Very beautiful and great place for kids",
          "Another great view over Barcelona. Take a ride in the train up and down the mountain",
          "Funny park at the top of Barcelona. A lot of walking ways, entertainment park and church with amazing views. Must to go if you want to look at the city from the eagle eye. Only for sunny weather )",

          "The view is amazing, the park itself is pretty much small and mostly for kids. Far away from the tourist areas and not that crowdy.\n\nThe church was great as well...",
          "This is the second oldest amusement park in Europe. The rides are'nt really special because is a par for young children not for adults or teenagers. The views of the city are great. You can access to the highest part of the park without the whole day ticket and enjoy some the rides buying a single ride ticket.",
          "Great place. Can enjoy a fantastic view!",
          "Beautiful place! Must visit",
          "It gives you many things at once. The best view of Barcelona and the nearby towns. You can also pump some adrenaline with the rides and if you come to Barcelona with kids, this is going to be their favorite spot.",

          "Alot of this was closed on my visit however some great views",

          "Great place to have a great pic-nic",
          "Amazing journey up the mountain. The amusements are fantastic. Great views from the top. Church is beautiful. Absolutely recommend going here. Went on out last day when we had a flight to catch so had to leave reasonably quickly. Only wish we had more time to enjoy it here.",
          "A nice place to check out the view of the city and a nice cathedral to see also. The shop there was unfortunately not the best, since they did not offer but a few tables for the customers that had no view over the city.",
          "Sooooo much fun!",
          "Very overstated. Half of the attractions were closed. Nothing really interesting. Service at the food points was more than awful, in fact I've never seen such thing anywhere - I waited more than 45min for French fries. The same thing was at \u2026",
          "Very beautiful place for all family top of the Barcelona city",

          "Beatiful view of entire Barcelona but little windy.",
          "Good rides and alright prices usually 25 euros for a whole day of unlimited rides",
          "Ok ammusment park although a little frustrating as 95cm tall child gets on similar rides where as here they have to be 100cm.\nBreath taking views of Barcelona. Worth the trip up if only for that. \nYou pay for wristbands rather than an entry \u2026",
          "Very cool for younger kids (2 - 9)",
          "Fantastic view .. small amusement park with couple of games to ride",
          "Very very good. A nice view to the city and I enjoyed it .",
          "Family trip on a Saturday morning! Had to use bus, metro, train, cable cars and bus again .. but the view was amazing and the kids had such a good time. We could use only 1st floor's rides because in February they open only weekends. Ticket \u2026",

          "Amazing views! Top destination in Barcelona. Definitely have to be visit. Recommend!",
          "A fun place to visit with fantastic views of Barcelona. The ride up on the funicular is a must. The church is impressive and you get to climb to the very top. The small selection of antique rides is fun. All in all a great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "The hike from Park Guell is around an hour. The views are amazing! Peaceful and places for you to sit and relax. There are vending machines for you to get water bottles as well as sodas (fantastic, coke, etc.). There was also a small pastry \u2026",
          "This is a bit of the way out of the city center but worth the trip. The views of Barcelona are incredible and the beautiful church are worth the visit. We went in January be careful it can be a touch cold it's a beautiful walk though.",
          "One of my favorite places",
          "One of my favourite places and viewing points",
          "So cosy and old fashioned. Cheap",

          "Very nice place to enjoy the breeze(in the summer months)  and the view of the city.",
          "Well the view is gorgeous. You can see all of Barcelonfrom up there. The sagrada famiglia  And the sea. I dif not play in the amusement Park. But did capture great photos and made a couple of videos doe my YouTube channel \ud83d\ude09",
          "Fun for kids. Quite costly if you want to try all the attractions.",
          "Excellent views. Pay for the trip up here. Don\u2019t walk it!!",
          "Great for kids. I have been there and for adults there is only one or two games. I paid 37 per 2 person. It definetely has spectacular views.",
          "only open till 21,  otherwise its great theme park, had lot of fun",
          "Great view over the city and the church is also very nice to be at. To get to the top you have to take the elevator, however, for some reason, this roundtrip going up and down will cost you 4 euro's. That seems a bit much to me for a 30 \u2026",
          "Best view not only of Barcelona city but also to the Mountains around. We went Hiking from Baixador de Vallvidrera to the Tibidabo.",
          "Incredible Park to enjoy with the family.",
          "You could spend all day there great for kids.",
          "Kids can enjoy a few rides, while you enjoy the views. Don't plan on lingering too long",
          "Probably an unmissable trip in Barcelona for the stunning view. Forget about the 80s fun fair, it's all about the view. Don't get sucked into buying tickets for the park, unless that's your kind of thing. The scenic view is free both from \u2026",
          "My son loved the red plane. A lot of fun and very cheap",
          "Tibidabo is one of the most ancient and emblematic funfairs parks in Spain. Besides of getting in the attraction park (by paying an entry fare)  you can have fun by walking in the park and enjoying the most  beautiful views of Barcelona. \u2026",
          "Incredible view to Barcelona and the sea. Amazing church. Also, the trip with many different and interesting vehicles to the spot was great!",
          "The Site is splendid, but attractions don't  justifi the wait. Queus are too long.",

          "For me the best thing. Nice view of Barcelona city. Really you should stop by.",
          "How to reach this place?\nThe route shown by Google maps to take T2B bus from Val d' Hebron can't be done while using the Hola Barcelona pass. So you have to take a long route which you can go free with Hola Barcelona pass. Follow the below \u2026",
          "It's really good",

          "There are extremely long waiting times and the prices are too high. Actually I couldn't understand what was the purpose of this place. The Tibidabo mountain is a nice place, there's a beautiful church on the top of it and the views of the \u2026",
          "Wonderful views from this compact but well-loved amusement park. Watching the sunset from the ferris wheel is a great treat. The prices are fair and there is enough variety for any family.",

          "Great fun. Wonderful view of the city",
          "Very nice place to visit",

          "This is a wonderful place for children, lots of old fashioned rides.",
          "A beautiful place !! Best view of Barcelona.",
          "Amazing view. check if it is a school day or getting on any of the rides will take forever or even won't be allowed to get on some.",
          "Nice place with a great view",
          "I was there at night but the view is beautiful",
          "Only there as part of a tour of Barcelona. The fairgrounds were not open at the time. There is a big church to visit if you are up there.",
          "Cool spot.. went up to see the sagred heart.. what a stunning view of Barcelona",
          "The park was close but just for the view at the highest point it was worth going there",
          "Good for smaller children, only a couple of facilities fun for teenagers and above :)",
          "It is worthy place - views are amazing, you could get some churros and have a walk, look around. We got there from downtown using T10 card - it was fun and easy , though some ppl saying its lots of interchanges - it was like a small \u2026",
          "You don't necessarily  go for the Amusement Park, you go for the fantastic view of Barcelona. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USUAL FUNICULAR IS NOT IN OPERATION AT THE MOMENT.  You have to use the alternate funicular which uses a small bus as part of the route. This is the free option, otherwise you will pay 12 euros for the other funicular bus.",
          "You can have an overview to the whole city from upthere",
          "A must see when you go to Barcelona!\n\nAbsolutely breathtaking inside and outside. It's beautifully crafted. You can pay to get a lift up to the upper section and then there's a climb to reach the top (Jesus) - only one of us made it right \u2026",
          "It's an experience to remember.  Tourist in Barcelona and the environ should endeavour to list it as a must go. Still reminiscing.",
          "An average park and definitely an exciting activity to do whilst in Barcelona. The city views are beautiful and there is an on site restaurant as well. A gift and candy store is located on the premises as well.",
          "The one hour transport from the city is totally worth it!!! An epic view you won't see twice in your life. There's not much to do else than that there so you need to have half a day to spend just for the view ;)",
          "Essential place if you visit Barcelona in good weather,  impressive views of the city from 550 meters high  mountain of Tibidabo, the access to the terrace are free.",

          "Great place for kids mostly",
          "Great view! Would recommend paying the couple euros for the elevator to the top of the Church.",
          "Not all the attractions were open for apparently no reason and literally no one told us so. The view is great, the park not so much. Anyway, visit the park on weekends, all the attractions should be open.",
          "A big hype.... Check for days they are not working",
          "Great place to go and see Barcelona from the top.",
          "Bit busy but nice views and a funny ride",
          "Don't try to go by bus, it's a fraud. You will have to wait more than an hour and the service in general is not worth it. Also, it is pointless to claim any kind of compensation or even trying to make complains.",
          "Interesting place. Strange to have an amusement park on top.of mountain but the views are wonderful",
          "Really nice location with the best view over Barcelona! The queues for the attractions are seriously long on sunny days and you have to wait really long to get on a ride, which is annoying. We just visited the Panorama Area of the park. The entry is a little overprized for my taste.",
          "Cool if you don't mind watling on the line",
          "Awesome place, enjoyable and well recommended",
          "highest point in Barcelona. amazing views. one can see literally the whole city from here. place is colder and windier compared to city",
          "It was ok, plenty of food choices, i did not entered the amusement Park, in my opinion an amusement Park should not be in front of a church, but it is just my opinion.\nThe toilets that are closest are small and there is always a queue, more \u2026",
          "The old fashioned rides were fun and the views were fantastic",
          "Incredible city and sea views.",
          "Beautiful view & not that far from Barcelona Center.",
          "Very beautiful place, make up for the visit with younger children, watch out before going to the height of the toys. Wonderful view of Barcelona. You can arrive by bus or car",
          "Nice view, but only one mildly interesting attraction",
          "Great view on Barcelona, definitely worth a treck",
          "Good for the view. Not much else unless you have kids.",
          "It's a great place to chill out..",
          "Great views of the city with a fun amusement park and religious site",
          "Worth a visit. Views are spectacular.",
          "Nice place can spend all day, suitable for the family. Bought ticket to use all attractions enjoyed very much. If you ever there visit the Kruger Hotel amazing show. Secure parking. Reasonable prices.",
          "Very nice plays with a amazing view over Barcelona. The attractions are a bit to expensive in my opinion",
          "It's beautiful and you can see the beauty of Barcelona but the ticket for the entrance is too high..",
          "Very expensive and super small themed park. Not really worth it for adults. Mainly for kids.",
          "Verry much fun",
          "That is amazing placee",
          "I'm really disappointed. The wait for most of the rides is over 30 minutes and the food you find here is mostly fast food. Not my definition of quality time.",
          "This park does not have entrance fee. You can visit and then buy tickets if you wanna play something. Apart from this, you can come to see the panoramic view of whole Barcelona and other cities in catalunya. And the most beautiful building \u2026",
          "Amazing view, super sweet train ride to the top.",
          "You should wait for half an hour to have 1 minute ride. Also inormouse queue for the tickets and strange priority queue for their friends. The atractions are old and not really attractive. They did not want to allow my son to have a ride on \u2026",
          "Had an absolutely amazing time one of the best views of the city and the amusement park is so fun for people of all ages! Can\u2019t recommend this place highly enough well worth the trek!",
          "If you dont have a ticket for the attraction (28.5 euro), you can not get on most buses like T2B. They don't accept standard bus ticket or money. It is ridiculous. You have to get on bus only from Plaza Catalunya. It is a thieve",
          "Only for kids. There is a parking for 10 euros",
          "Transportation was a bit difficult but the scenery was absolutely fantastic.",
          "You can have a nice walk through the park without paying.  There is a shaded playground area with a few slides, lots of places to picnic with your family.  The beautiful Bacilica Sagrada Corizones is right there as well.  Amazing view of Barcelona and a funicular can take you down the mountainside.",
          "This review is about the entire experience visiting this tourist trap. No one tells you that the Funicular is out of service, yet they still sell you tickets, then tell you a bus comes every 30 minutes to truck you up to the top. You then \u2026",
          "When I was in Barcelona I heard about this park and I really wanted to get to it. I took the tour bus and went to Funicular del Tibidabo and got on the funicular to Parc d'Atraccions Tibidabo. We drove down the funicular, and in front of us \u2026",
          "A very underrated attraction in Barcelona. Stunning views of the city and pretty good theme park. Tickets are quite expensive, we opted for the blue band price which includes free rides on the top level, which has the most scenic views. The \u2026",
          "Very hight on mountian the park. And the rides is love. Must visit 1 of the best attraction place in Barcelona",

          "I like it, nice view to the city",
          "Very beautiful views and fun for children",
          "Beware of this company.  I bought tickets to go to the Amusement Park the same day.  We were charged \u20ac57 only to find out later that the park was not open.  They then refused to refund our money!  We were in Barcelona only a few days.  This \u2026",
          "Good walk to get there. Amazing view on Barcelona, th\u00e9 Park is Nice but nothing fantastic for me. Good place for \u00e0 few hours.",

          "Spectacular view, but cable car under construction while summer",

          "nice location and nice little park",
          "Very small amusement park closed, but views from the top of the mountain are spectacular.",
          "Not bad, but maybe not worth the detour if you don\u2019t have a lot of time in Barcelona.",
          "Great for kids and family!",
          "Here was good site to play , and you can be Happy",
          "Marvellous view. Especially after a stormy day!",
          "One of the best places in Barcelona & for me I have ever went, the view & atmosphere there is wonderful, spend best time there & took remorable photos, totally recommended for all friends, families couples, my childs were also soo happy especially with birds & safe games",
          "Amazing place! Must visit!",
          "Beautiful and must see!",
          "Amazing views, but bring a jacket--the wind makes it chilly!",

          "Beautifull views.",
          "Fabulous and intriguing place. Loads to do.",
          "Really good attraction park in my opinion. Good place for kids, but parents can also find something fun for themselves. Good historical landmark and viewpoint too. Definitely would recommend visiting.",
          "This park is absolute garbage. totaly destroying atmosphere of tibidabo place . park for kids are nice but problem of this that is very very loud and bad music coming from sound system of amusement park.",
          "You can have a very fabulous view of the Barcelona city from Tibitabo . We hired a taxi cab to go there but on our way back we took bus #111 right from tibitabo park to a funicular station ( Funicular ride was good) and then a train to the city centre.",
          "Great place for pictures and recreation with all the family",
          "A must for the retro lovers. Also great views of the city of Barcelona. Not overly easy to get there by public transport, but still worth a visit!",
          "Bad management. People kept cutting the line and no one around to say stop. Long waiting time to ride an attraction. Better visit the church next to it to enjoy beautiful art work and views.",
          "A lot, a lot of things. You have what to choose.",
          "At Tibidabo you can get a nice view of the entire city. The Blue tram is a unique way to travel to the top and back down. Great place for young and old. At the top you will find the Temple of the Sacred Heart, a resataurant and the Amusement Park.",
          "Nice place to visit when you visit Barcelona you must visit this location",
          "The staff from the information center was very unqualified and rude.\nThe journey was very complicated, because the rack railway did not drive.\n\nThe only great thing was the view.",
          "Fun with family and friends",
          "Nice place. But in this time of year we have not found any restaurant here",
          "Nice park with beautiful buildings and a lot of trees",
          "We had a good time but the waiting times where slightly too long that day. The food is over-priced as in every park of this type. The attractions are good for children also of lower age. Though it was sad that after standing in queue for 15 \u2026",
          "Nice to go when it's foggy... jeje locks like in a semi horror movie. There is also some spooky music playing mean wile you walk in the park. Was am amazing experience with fog. I believe so different as when it is clear sky",
          "Very nice and easy to find the perfect place for you and your family!",
          "Very nice experience exept for the only option for food - junk food and long long waiting lines. Kids love it though.",

          "Pretty cool. Good for kids",
          "The lines are very slow, and seemingly normal families with 8 kids show up and skip the line with disabled passes.  On rides like Tibi City, 8 kids can take a half hour.  I suspect someone in ticketing is giving away disabled passes to friends.",
          "There should not be that theme park, it kills the atmosfere of that mountain and church.",

          "OMG, this place is amazing. Some locals mentioned  that it was the best view in Barcelona.  I gotta admit the locals are 100 percent  right.   No charge to go up  into the church. The amusement  park is a charge. But not neccessary  .",

        "wiki": "Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya (pronounced [\u02c8plas\u0259 \u00f0\u0259 k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8lu\u0272\u0259], meaning in English \"Catalonia Square\"; sometimes referred to as Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a, its Spanish name) is a large square in central Barcelona that is generally considered to be both its city centre and the place where the old city (see Barri G\u00f2tic and Raval, in Ciutat Vella) and the 19th century-built Eixample meet.\n\nSome of the city's most important streets and avenues meet at Pla\u00e7a Catalunya: Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Rambla de Catalunya, La Rambla, and Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, in addition to Ronda de Sant Pere, Carrer de Vergara, and Carrer de Pelai. The plaza occupies an area of about 50,000 square metres. It is especially known for its fountains and statues, its proximity to some of Barcelona's most popular attractions, and the flocks of pigeons that gather in the centre. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the medieval city walls were demolished in the 19th century, ambitious designs for the city's public spaces were conceived under the guidance of notable urban planners. Pla\u00e7a Catalunya was conceived as part of pla Rovira in 1859, but no official permission from the government was given until the 1888 Universal Exposition. It was urbanised for the first time in 1902 and was further modified in 1929, on the occasion of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, which also included the construction of a metro station. Architect Francisco Nebot designed the changes made in 1929.\nIn May 2011 Pla\u00e7a Catalunya was the main location where anti-government protests and sit ins were held in Barcelona, mirroring the events in other Spanish cities.\n\n\n== Art ==\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nPla\u00e7a Catalunya hosts quite a few interesting sculptures representative of Noucentisme, Neo-Classicism and different avant-garde movements.\n\nDeessa, by Josep Clar\u00e0.\nPastor de Pau, by Pablo Gargallo.\nFrancesc Maci\u00e0 monument.

          "Certainly one of the main plazas in Barcelona. It has attractive fountains and statuary and a center point for the free Barcelona walking tours. You would definitely have to cut through this plaza if you were to venture off for the high end shopping area and to visit any of the",

          "The plaza itself is nothing special and I would not go out of my way to visit it as a tourist attraction. However, you will certainly walk through it plenty of times on your visit to the city. The restaurants on or near the plaza tend to cater to tourists with overpriced menus",

          "I'm happy that I stayed at this hotel. First of all it's locared in the city center, you have so many places to choose for walk in the evening, for example there are singing fontains not far from the hotel and it takes you about 30 minute to go to Port of Barselona. Second",
          "Walk all Passeig de Gracia before getting to this huge and Amazing square. Even the Rambla starts from here. it's picturesque and all Barcelona people will pass from here, so if you stay a day here, the Whole city will pass in front of your eyes.",

          "Lovely area but spoiled by the amount of pigeons. Having visited St Marks square in Venice where there are now signs everywhere saying not to feed the pigeons, I definitely think this is something which should be invested in here",
          "This central and bussy point of Barcelona surrounded by monumental buildings is not a beautiful one. Maybe because it has been rebuilted many times. The current enormous square was created between 1925 and 1927. A large number of sculptures are planted around the central paved",
          "Quite by accident we discovered that Plaza de Catalunya is: the end point for the Aerobus; within walking distance of our hotel; next to an 8-story department store that includes a food market; a primary stop for the Hop On/Off bus and where two of the routes overlap, and",
          "The Central hub of Barcelona. Parking here is charged by the minute (see photo). There are a lot of street pigeons and street hawkers selling fake goods. This area is rife for pickpockets and handbag snatchers. Having said that it is surrounded by impressive buildings and is",

          "This is a huge plaza with various statues from history. It also has a huge population of pigeons. There is a mall around the plaza, the Hard Rock Cafe, and more. It is right by La Rambla!",
          "Plaza de Cataluna, with statues, , pigeons galore , and colorful street vendors is a hub between La Ramblas and other important avenues. Nice place for a short stroll as you explore Barcelona.",

          "This is the center of the town. Buses, Metro and tours start here. Lots of activity in this area. If you are close to the Plaza nothing is far away.",

          "It's one of the most crowded places in Barcelona. It's easy to access it from almost anywhere so it's the main point for meeting someone when you don't know the city very well.",
          "This Plaza is at one end of La Ramblas and certainly has large numbers, but it's more open and enjoyable. The center square is a haven for pigeons and seagulls and you can spot kids in a state of delight holding out food for birds tame enough to hop on their hands to feed.",
          "This is the center of Barcelona. And that's about it. However during holidays special events are held here.",
          "So my experience of this Plaza was on a date with a local. They mentioned this was one place that would be great to check out, and they were right. I would suggest going in the evening, you get to see the Art Gallery on the top of the Plaza, if you're there during the evening",

          "Likely the biggest square in downtown Barcelona. Good starting point for exploring the city as you can go towards Ramblas and Barri Gothic, or then opposite direction to Passeig de Gracia. As a square not that unique however but I guess a must see.",
          "Terrible experience. It seems that this is a perfect place for pickpockets and thieves, either avoid this altogether or make sure you have no valuables or important documents on you. There are multiple street cafes that are dirty and smell of urine, not an aspirational place",
          "Catalonia sq. Then we walk all the way throw the Catalonia Bolouvar to get to the square and u can find some buildings on the way that seined by Gaudi and some of them are museum some of them not but they are beautiful and u can not notice them they r really eye catchy. you can",

          "It seems that many tours meet at some place around the square. There are fountains and sculptures. Very busy area with tourists and the Ramblas starts near one corner. Buildings which may now house the Apple store were significant spots during the Spanish Civil War.",
          "Easy access to Placa de Catalunya from the airport via Aerobus. You'll be able to walk to your hotel if you reserve nearby. La Rambla starts directly off Placa de Catalunya. And, the not-to-be-missed Palau de la Musica Catalana is a short walk from the Plaza. Don't miss the",
          "Covered with pigeons & homeless around the Plaza.... But is a nice place to walk through if you are in the city center before heading down the Ramblas..",
          "The park is at the north end of the Ramblas marked a good spot to start our walk through the Gothic Quarter. We used a free Rick Steve's audio tour guide that introduced us to the city and provided a lot of meaningful background about the history and orientation of the city. It",

          "Ok nothing special but on the way to everything. Also kids like feeding pigeons. Good to stop for 10 minutes before starting walking around.",
          "This is a central place that's good as a starting point for all your sightseeing - it's not a place you go to see perse, just a landmark. If you were meeting people this would be a good, recognizable place to meet them, plan your adventures around the city and feed the pigeons.",
          "We ended up here several times during our stay. The hop on tour bus lines change at this location. There is shopping and eating around here. Beautiful flowers, too!",

          "Plaza de Cataluna is really nice place to take a rest after long distance walking, but it has one minus. It's so many birds over there and people feed them so they fly here even more, that's not really nice actually.",
          "really pretty, very busy, magnificent, full of life, plaza de cataluna cannot be missed, but maybe the throngs of people also detract from its beauty?",
          "This is one of the central plazas for the city. Although the city has made an effort to make it nice, there is no reason to visit it, except as a starting point to go somewhere else, such as Las Ramblas",

          "The Plaza is the heart of the city. It is where the Aerobus stops, the Hop on Hop Off buses begin, the various metro buses and it is a major station for the metro trains. It is a great hive of attactivity with La Rambla leding down to the marina and other streets and lanes",
          "Love Plaza de Cataluna. Lovely shops can be found here and this tends to be the place where you can pick up many of the local attractions, ie.hop on/off buses etc.",

        "wiki": "The Magic Fountain of Montju\u00efc (Catalan: Font m\u00e0gica de Montju\u00efc, Spanish: Fuente m\u00e1gica de Montjuic) is a fountain located at the head of Avinguda Maria Cristina in the Montju\u00efc neighborhood of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The fountain is situated below the Palau Nacional on the Montju\u00efc mountain and near the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya and Poble Espanyol de Barcelona. The fountain, like most of the surrounding developments, was constructed for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition.The fountain sprays 700 gallons of water a second through 3620 jets to create its effect.  The highest water spout is 170 feet.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Magic Fountain was designed by Carles Bu\u00efgas, who had designed illuminated fountains as early as 1922. The site where the fountain was constructed was the previous location of The Four Columns. The columns, representative of the Catalanism movement, were demolished in 1928 under the orders of Prime Minister Miguel Primo de Rivera and were re-erected in 2010 a few meters away from the original location.\nBu\u00efgas submitted his design a year before the exhibition, with many calling the plan too ambitious, with too little time to complete. The construction project utilized over 3,000 workers. The first show took place on May 19, 1929, the day before the start of the Exposition. The fountain was badly damaged in the Spanish Civil War and did not operate until 1955, after Buigas oversaw needed repairs.In the 1980s, music was incorporated with the light show and the fountain, along with the Museu Nacional (National Museum), was completely restored prior to the 1992 Summer Olympics, held at Montju\u00efc. Performances include film, classical, and modern music, such as The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, a Spanish zarzuela movement, \"Barcelona\" by Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9, and modern pop songs. Performances take place at half-hour intervals every weekend, with weekends extended during the summer season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Magic Fountain at the Ajuntament de Barcelona website\nMagic Fountain of Montjuic in Barcelona",

          "Got to the steps at 7 and was already very busy but got a good view and when the fountains started and Freddy Mercury\u2019s \u2018 Barcelona\u2019 struck up it was magical.To see the colours and the power of the fountain was awesome.Would definitely recommend.",
          "With one of the few things that\u2019s free in Barcelona, magic fountain is lined by both kids and the adults. To get suitable place to watch, reach at least 1.5 hours before the time. The seatings provided are ideal place and make sure that you avoid places very near to fountain",
          "In front of the Catalunya museum, there is a magnificent Magic Fountain sitting inside the Pla\u00e7a Marques De Foronda. This giant fountain has 3620 water jets within its 3.1 million litre pool. Each of its fountain show lasts 20 minutes and it runs every 10 mins. Its opening times",
          "The show is very beautiful, so it attracts cents of people there. It can be viewed from some distance and it's really eye-catching. To cheer the public, the dancing waters in different colours is complemented by a playlist of nice pop/rock music and some traditional songs,",
          "Loved the fountain. Lots of people geather around it to watch the show even in winter time. It starts around 8 pm, depends on a season.",
          "Part of the light and sound show on certain evenings. Worth going to see it. It is quite magical. For those who have been to Las Vegas, it reminded me what they do at the Bellagio Hotel.",
          "This is one of the best attarction of Barcelona. The fountain is huge. The light and sound show is extra ordinary. However it only works 3 days a week - Thursday to Staurday. Check the website for the fountain for schedule - before planning your visit. We visited from Sunday to",
          "It was a mystical & magical entertainment at the National arts museum, watching the huge magical fountain. It is a free visual treat to all for 30 minutes on select days of a week. Check for the days of performance before going, as the schedule changes to the season. The whole",
          "The beautiful show - water , color , music. Try to see it while in Barcelona. Make sure you know the schedule in advance.",
          "Placa d'Espanya is a great place to relax. Arenas de Barcelona is ok. Simply stroll and enjoy the view",
          "The palace and the fountain are wonders to see even when the waters are not dancing to music. But it is worth hanging out to see the show (when we were in Barcelona, it was 8-9:00 on Thursday and Friday nights only). It was crowded, but we stood on the walking bridge so that we",
          "I took our teenagers to see The Magic Fountain and it was heaps of fun and free. Basically it is a water, light and sound show free for everyone to enjoy. The music selection is wide and covers most languages and styles. We enjoyed some songs in English, Spanish and Italian",
          "It was a magical moment when I reached there and got mesmerised by the dance I got water with a beautiful melody and this was it a great night with a fabulous display and music \ud83c\udfb6",
          "Magical fountain is really good but make sure to check the timing and day of display in advance. It changes from summers to winters and from day of the week to weekend. Do go there in plenty of time to get good view.",
          "Worth a visit, despite the crowds that come to this spectacle in the evening. To see the fountains glowing and splashing, the music in the background, a great experience that, despite the large number of people, is worth a visit and a great start for an evening in Barcelona.",
          "It was absolutely beautiful!!! We were there for the new years celebrations and it was truly spectacular!",
          "They had a nice light show by new years eve. They had good security too. Nice place to see for once and to be there",
          "There is nothing magical about it. Yes the synchronization and the music are good but there stops the story. There are not enough seating arrangements to watch the show and people sit wherever possible. Hawkers and street vendors throng the place and are an obstacle at times. I",
          "Very special fountain. We liked the evening show a lot. Amazing. At daytime it does not look so good, however, worth visiting.",
          "Celebrating 90 years of water fountains!! Simply beautiful!! The fountain is huge and located at the centre of the Spanish square. It has other small fountains all over as a frame of beauty!!!",
          "Very, very good and for free! It was busy but not as bad as I had expected but it was December so I expect in the summer months it will be busier. We stood on the steps, depending on the way the wind is blowing you may get a little spray from the water, well worth watching",
          "We rode Metro Line 1 to Placa de Espanya. What a busy place in evening traffic! We walked to the Font Magica de Montjuic and having arrived early, found seats directly in front of the fountain. A group of young men put on a dance show as we waited and passed their hats for",
          "The magical fountain started right on time with very beautiful water works and colors. The synchronization was brilliant and also the mini fountains in the background made it even more special. The songs played were also mainstream so it was fun to sing along. I would definitely",
          "I had heard about this Magic Fountain, and made sure not to miss it. Best to google the show times; they vary a bit per month, and no shows in Jan-Feb as far as I know. I went in Sept and made sure I was in the area at the top part (The museum side) at around 9. First, they",
          "I was there today, but the spectacles are only 31 december, 1 st and 2 nd january, so if you wanna see the lighted fountain go in these days. But the view from the top place is the best you can see at night, just amazing.",
          "A popular show of a colourful fountain display to music. Also ensure you take the escalator up toward the house for a spectacular view.",
          "Having made an effort to visit this fountain due to it being advertised that music would play with the water movement I have to say we were a little disappointed. Every piece of music played the fountain had the same lighting and colours. Glad I saw it but wouldn\u2019t do it again",
          "Definitely a fun experience with beautiful lights water and music. Crowds are large. Definitely worth a nighttime visit and glad I went but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s five star spectacular.",
          "It's nice , splashy and musically but kitchy somehow , go there only if you've time , not a pure must.",
          "We got the metro to the watch the magic fountains. It was easy to find and a nice experience. Very pretty to watch the water flow from the top right the way down. It was a good experience and if you haven\u2019t been to Las Vegas I could imagine it would be quite a spectacular thing",
          "The Magic Fountain is closely to Plaza De Espana on one sight, and Monjuic and Museum to another side. The experience of fountain is free of charge.",
          "Just a wonderful acoustic and visual experience. Don't be put off by the illegal booze sellers....if you don't want a drink just tell them to walk on!",
          "We checked the website and also asked at the tourist information centre and was told 8pm to 9pm for the fountain. We arrived 7:45 the place in darkness and very few people around, just like us a few tourists hoping it would be worth braving the cold night. Unfortunately it was",
          "After experiencing the musical fountain in Hanoi, which was amazing, this magic fountain in Barcelona, came a bit on the down side fr me. Do not mis-understand me, it is nice but not beyond it. the magic fountain was not sophicticated and music responsive as I expected. played",
          "It's a very nice light show with good music. At night it plays every half hour. It's a sort of wonderful magical feeling you get when seeing it up close. Would definitely recommend seeing it if you're in Barcelona. Only downside is that everyone and i mean everyone will want to",
          "Yes it is a big beautiful fountain BUT it is till just a fountain like many many others in the world. It is a big draw so expect a crowd for the night \u201cshow\u201d. I honestly enjoyed it more in the afternoon with no one there much better.",
          "Very nice Light & Music show by the Magic Fountain. Go early to choose a good view of the fountain...",
          "did it last night beautiful light and water show,even though it was a cold night but a lot of people nice atmosphere quite magical",
          "We didn't know what to expect from the magic fountain, but it was so beautiful and relaxing. An experience of a lifetime. We didn't even know of it until we went for a walk in the evening and seen huge crowds gather around, so we waited for roughly an hour before the show",
          "This is one of many attractions that were built in the Montjuic area for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. This fountain is impressive not only for its size but also for the numerous and varied water fountain patterns and water shows that it performs. There are over",
          "This was so beautiful! It does get very crowded and people arrive quite early to get in a good position and there are a few good places to sit on the wall opposite so people took them early so I\u2019d recommend grabbing a some food or drink and getting a good view. The fountain was",
          "Don't miss this orientation of music and lights at the fountain! Very beautiful. Arrive early to get a good viewing location. The grounds are scenic and it makes for a great evening out!",
          "The fountains themselves are spectacular. I am really happy we visited. The light and music show was short, sweet, and superb, but, oh my, the number of people to see this spectacle is HUGE! It was hard to find a spot, impossible to be nowhere without being squished or pushed,",
          "A nice location with beautiful displays. Make sure to arrive at least an hour early to get a decent spot to see the fountain show. The displays are varied and stunning. It\u2019s right by a metro station and the MNAC museum is at the top of the hill so you can make a day of it",
          "A fountain show to rival Las Vegas. What an amazing show. Music for all ages and lights. The show was wonderful. I would definitely recommend. For free it was a fantastic show. Just make sure you check the times.",
          "Absolutely enchanting fountain in the middle of Barcelona. With the sun shining , the fountain beauty shone bright......amazing and tranquil.",
          "The fountain was one of my favorite things that we did in Barcelona on our trip. Truly a spectacular display of colour, light, motion, music and water acrobatics!!! It\u2019s very famous and if you are planning to see it, you\u2019ll be among the crowds but it only adds the magic in my",
          "This was an awesome night time attraction that I could not recommend more. We went on a Saturday night and the area was full with several thousand people. We were treated town awesome fountain and light show. To make it even better it was free. The pictures were some of the best",
          "A wonderful fountain that fits so nicely with the museum behind it. We have been there during the night but should worth it.",
          "One of the places you should definitely visit. The show was amazing and its free. It does get fairly busy so arrive in plenty of time.",
          "The setting is beautiful. But if you're choosing between seeing a show or going to this, pic the theater. It's pretty and the music coordination is fun, I just didn't think it was as spectacular as the other reviews I read. Don't get me wont, you'll enjoy it just fine. I'm just",
          "Go early to get a seat, it just kept going. covers all music tastes and endless combinations of fountains misting and colours.",
          "Beautiful evening watching the fountains and lights dancing to music. Wandered around the grounds to watch the fountains from different levels. Would go again",
          "Colored-lights shine on the fountain that dances with music. Lots of couples, families, and groups of all ages will be out enjoying the show.",
          "These fountains are huge and in a prominent area in front of a big museum up the hill and also at a big crossroads where the metro is provided. Lovely spot.",
          "Magic Fountain show, so beautiful right in front of the State Capital. Music, mainly American pop through the ages, and colored lights on the fountains! The water is jetted up into the air so high and gorgeous. Just pay attention to the wind because you could get wet closer to",
          "Very nisce fountain located in a lovely area. It attracts the sights of the visitors and it is really beautiful!",
          "Wonderful colours and spectacular for about 5 minutes and then there isnt really any change for rest of the 20 minute show other than a change in music. The fountains dont change in tempo with music so once you've seen it for a little while it's done.",
          "Beats the Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas. With the music, lights, theatrics and fanfare, you can view this for hours on a nice day. Great venue for photos.",
          "Pretty good. It's a long show if you get there early. The seats on the stairs get taken right away. There are vendors selling some beer so that helps the enjoyment level.",
          "This is one of the things that you need to see in Barcelona. So whenever you are planning a trip to Barcelona make sure that your days are going to match with the days that the fountains are on. Because it's not every day. Also, it is a place that you need to arrive early to get",
          "The water feature show to light and music starts at 8pm. If you already in the area then stroll by but don't make a special trip. Feels like needs revamping. Interesting was the local talent busking on the sidewalk.",
          "I\u2019m sure this was exciting when it was first introduced in the 1920s...but - snoozeville tourist trap now.",
          "While exploring Montjuic one afternoon, we found out that the Magic Fountain light show happens every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8:00pm. We ended up watching the sunset up there then went down the street to grab a drink and snack to eat. Headed back up for the light show,",
          "While you are touring the city go by and see these beautiful fountains. I believe they might have a show on Friday and Saturday nights. Very nice",
          "Wrap up warm if you are going late in the year we were here in November and arrived early to get a seat on the steps. You really need something to sit on and the steps are very cold. If you can stand easily then you get a great view from the bridge in front of the fountain.",
          "The area is very pretty and right in front of the art museum. However,the day we went, the fountain was not on/functioning.",
          "The architecture, the fountains, the views, the grandeur of the whole area are beyond description. A must see for any tourist!",
          "I'd love to say we were out for a stroll in the evening and found this, but the truth is you have to plan it. In winter, it only happens on Thursdays to Saturdays, at 10pm. The area around the fountain was packed. We stood back on a pedestrian bridge a few dozen metres back. It",
          "Magnifique spectacle et gratuit! \u00c0 voir en prenant des trucs \u00e0 grignoter Beautiful ! You should be bring some food with you while enjoying the show !",
          "Definitely a nice touch after a great meal the different colors and the fresh clean smell of the water shooting in the air is very romantic in itself and fun to watch.",
          "What I love about Barcelona is that its sights run from the sublime, like Sagrada Familia, to the kinda smarmy. The Fountain is on the smarmy end of the spectrum but great for teenagers and younger kids. Major crowds. We arrived by subway. Two guys acting drunk walked DOWN",
          "A little chilly on a November evening, but a pleasant way to spend half an hour, totally free of charge, watching the Magic Founntain display. Just a few minutes walk from the Placa Espana, we stood on a bridge and had an excellent view of the display. The music could have been",
          "Fabulous place to visit. We visited Barcelona for my birthday. There's lots to do and visiting this place is free! There are some little stalls and public toilets near to the fountain. The weather was lovely whilst we were there too which always helps! Highly recommended",
          "As it says on the tin, a spectacular combination of fountains and music, and its free of charge ! Show starts at 8pm and lasts for about 30 minutes.",
          "If you are lucky enough to be there when the fountains are on then you will be amazed . Best viewed from the bottom of the stairs. When the fountains are off its still a nice view.",
          "We just went there last minute, it was crowded but we still had a lovely show. Music, lights are great. Really nice to watch. Make sure not to stay on one side but walk around the fountain and watch the show from higher (stairs up toward royal palace).",
          "Very popular fountain set to lights & music. Get there early if you want a close up view. Worth visiting as it's free.",
          "First of all, get there early (at least 1 hour) and pick a good panoramic spot. At the top of the stairs is recommended. The show with the fountains is super and if you are lucky street artists will perform before or after.",
          "1) The sound system is not good, we were standing 5 feet from the fountain and can hardly hear. Also the music and fountain don't sync up well. 2) a lot of tourist (that is to be expected), who will record the whole thing on their cell phones while holding the phone high",
          "The light and music at the fountain was amazing. I would recommend seeing this it is well worth a visit",
          "This Is a free event you can attend and very worthwhile. Takes about 20 minutes and the colourful fountains dance to music. We attended the international music event at 8 pm but at 8:30 it played to symphonic music.",
          "Very nice light show with music. The water and lights effects are captivating, the music is sometimes tacky but it's overall a cool experience to have, especially on a warm night.",
          "Trip Advisor failed to point out that this fountain does not work 24/7. Furthermore, the light shows are only (so we were told) held on Thursdays to Sundays in the evening. Perhaps it was the time of year we visited, but make sure you check so as not to be disappointed like us!",
          "I ran to the fountain on my first day and decided to go back with my camera that evening. Although it\u2019s busy the views were amazing especially at sun set.",
          "Very nice show started a but earlier, be aware the it continues with another song:) I would say you will find a good spot for watching all the time as it is huge.",
          "We enjoyed the fountain (and art museum) and the expansive public space around it. It was also great fun walking the back streets of the city from our central hotel to find it. Very doable for good walkers who can read a map. Note that google maps proposes an oddly longer way",
          "Located at the beginning of las Ramblet. Busy section but very attractive place to stop and look at. There are much to do around that area that you can explore shopping, restaurants, hotels etc....",
          "We couldn`t see the magic show, however we were hoping to see the fountains during the day. Well, we managed to get there only to see fountains with no water. That was 10 am, not sure if they do this during the day or the water is only for the magic show, who knows...a bit",
          "Its on each night to a different music theme. people from everywhere of all ages come together to just sit and enjoy great fun for families as its spectacular to watch",
          "Fantastic display to music, starts around 8pm with a different theme each night, we were treated to a first half of a Beatles medley, Bruno Mars, Little Mix and Justin Timberlake followed by a classical mix and obviously \"Barcelona\" lots of drinks/food stands, If you stand next",
          "We saw it, it was ok and the surrounding park is ok. We spent maximum 20 minutes there. It was not running when we arrived or at least not as much as on the pictures we saw online. So we went to the Gothic quarter which is just next to it.",
          "Very good entertainment for all the family. Get there early ISH to get s vantage point. The steps overlooking the fountain were packed by the time we arrived but we're able to stand next to the fountain but think you probably saw more from higher up.",
          "We have lived in Barcelona for 4 years and we loved comming here even though we did not make the first years.",
          "The changing colors were quite beautiful. Stayed here for about an hour. Nice fountain to visit. But I have seen better.",
          "Unfortunately, I was not here on one of the days they do the show ( Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in October), but the experience of going was still really nice. There is a fountain, but there is also a water fall here as well. This area can serve as great back drops to awesome",
          "This was a great find while on our Barcelona trip. It wasn\u2019t something we expected to find until we searched online for local attractions near our hotel. It is often quite busy around here and rightly so. There is a museum which is really good during the day but the main",
          "It's a beautiful place to visit - look around, the whole area is picturesque. I loved the Magic Fountain.I believe it's 30 min show with music and lights. You don't really need a tour, just walk there and enjoy your time. Check online the schedule of the shows.",
          "Great to see day or night. Busy square in the center of the city. Good meeting spot or just a nice place to sit a people watch.",
          "Caught a glimpse of it but apparently at night it is lit and there is fountain show with colours. Missed that!",
          "So if you go see the fort in Barcelona, your better off go see the fountain \u26f2. Starting from the top down you do get an awesome view of the city, each level has a different fountain which is pretty cool. It's a nice place to take some pictures and maybe have a sandwich \ud83e\udd6a if",
          "great think to see in barcelona!! located on placa espania and truly it is magical. But you shoult come erlier because to much people comes to see. Don t be to close to the fontain you will get wet!!!!",
          "We arrived about 7pm just in time to get a good spot to sit. Bring a picnic or snacks and drinks to enjoy. Recommend 100% , although tired the kids said it was worth the long walk and loved it!!!",
          "The show lasted about 1h and was spectacular. Defenetely a must see! In high season it\u2019s defentely worth arriving a bit early to gain a good wantage point.",
          "One of the true highlights of our trip to Barcelona was our night (actually two nights) visit to the Magic Fountain (Font magica de Montjuic). We had heard about the colors and varied spay patterns of the fountain, but seeing it in person was amazing and hard to leave. From 9 to",
          "Some of my best Barcelona pic's were taken area the Fountain, both day and night. Worth the time and effort to visit",
          "Good evening entertainment. There are toilets here but you need to tip the lady with the mop or she gets angry!!! But the beer off the tours selling it, you can get 3 cans of estrella for 3E if you barter enough!!!!",
          "We made it through the protests to get here and for a free show it is very impressive. I'm really glad we didn't miss it as we were recommended to go and check it out before getting to Barcelona.",
          "Great tour and guide with fabulous views of the fountain and drinks after just topped it off! Well worth it.",
          "After reading lots of reviews my family decided to visit this fountain and it really was fabulous. It\u2019s completely free but be warned as it gets extremely busy. We got there about 2 hours before it was meant to start and ate our picnic there so we managed to sit on the steps but",
          "It's wonderful, it's a wonderful feeling to be there. A handful of people, good vibes, a pleasant spectacle, it's worth seeing for sure. However, given today's technology and the number of tourist visits, I resent the bad audio sound as well as the selection of songs, which are",
          "Very beautiful to look at with the right light you can take amazing pictures. At the evening there are sometimes light iluminations.",
          "Very nice \ud83d\udc4d place to visit on a sunny afternoon you get great views of the city. Lovely time walking around to take in the views",
          "The evening atmosphere was nice with people surrounding the fountains and eagerly waiting for the show. The show is free with fountains changing colour and as if water is dancing to music .I feel the music choice could be improved. Lots of street vendors selling local small",
          "This is a unique hangout in the city....a little bit like the Spanish Steps. There are plenty of vendors and visitors, but it's not overly crowded. There are plenty of steps between the fountain and the museum so we recommend starting at the top and working downward to the",
          "In a lovely area of Barcelona with so much to see in the immediate vicinity. We saw the fountains by day but returned again on the Thursday evening (as per the schedule) to see the Magic Fountain in action at night. The advertised programme started at 9pm however we turned up",
          "As we finished exploring Poble Espanyol and taking photos, The magic Fountain is only walking distance from Poble Espanyol it took us 10-15mins walk, the Plaza is huge wherein you can sit and relax and enjoy the magnificent fountain, the place is so relaxing, just be there early",
          "Check the times out and get there early if you want a seat on the steps, also you may want to pack some food & drink. For free you can't knock it. The water & light show is great fun",
          "The pictures of this look majestic, do your research so you aren\u2019t disappointed. We missed out due to the time of our visit and the changes to the seasonal timing of the show. We had hoped to see the fountains running without the show. But when we got there they were still. We",
          "The walk towards the fountain from Spanish Plaza is beautiful, with fountains on the roadside towards the grand magic fountain show. The show is amazing, well organized and fun. We stood on one of the over-crossings to get a good sight, but the traffic under the bridge does",
          "A great variety of music accompanies a beautiful fountain show - don\u2019t be afraid to work your way to the front, you may get a little wet from the spray, but it\u2019s actually much less crowded than it appears from a distance!",
          "A great sight to see and so easy to get to. The metro brings you right to the start of the walk way up. The show lasts from 9-10 pm from memory but lots to do round there.",
          "One of the favorite things to do in Barcelona at night is to watch the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, at the beginning of Avinguda Maria Cristina in the Montjuic neighborhood. The Magic Fountain is a 'must-see' Barcelona attraction. You have never seen a fountain like this. It does",
          "Practically one of those things that makes you realize how great people are when they want to do great things. One of the most beautiful experiences in Barcelona, you must definitely see. I advise you to arrive a little bit before in order to get places that are better suited to",
          "First you need to check the timetable. Then be there in advance and you can get a good place to watch the show.",
          "Go at night when they light it up and do it to music! Quite a scene!! I took a night time bike ride through Barcelona which made a stop here!",
          "The fountain itself is beautiful. But continue up the many many steps (escalator is available for those unable to do a lot of steps) to get the most gorgeous view of the city. Further up the mountain is a museum. Yes, it is all free !",
          "The waterfalls were being repaired/cleaned so not much to see. The large fountain was lovely but again, a limited display. The gardens and pathways around the fountains could do with some tlc.",
          "If you visit Barcelona this is a not to be missed experience. It is completely free. Great for all the family to go to and watch. If you google it you can find what times it is on, on what days and which months as it changes throughout the year. There are stands to get food and",
          "See this fountain with a music and light show at night. For the best experience, get as close to the fountain as you can, if you don't mind getting wet!",
          "One of the best show in Barcelona for one great hour 3 times per the week, dont miss it when you are there made you feel you are fairytale. \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc95",
          "a lovely sound and light show at night. A lot of people in attendance. Good to have seen it once and probably better to have seen it with some beers on board as it is kinda psychadelic",
          "My boyfriend and I trekked here on our last night in Barcelona to see the show and were not disappointed. The place was buzzing, the fountain display was colourful and the music had something for everyone, started poppy and then when classical/orchestral...a must see.",
          "It\u2019s not the most impressive water fountain displays I\u2019ve ever seen but it\u2019s really great and well worth a visit. I loved the atmosphere and the music was prince and Bowie so great. The music changes with each performance so check it out and go when your favs are playing.",
          "Worth seeing. Happens at 9pm and lasts about 30 minutes. Get there by 830. Crowds are huge...beware of pickpockets. Stand with your back to the wall near one of the bridges.",
          "Beautiful fountain with a nice light and music show on Friday and Saturday night. Rate this as an average fountain though and not worth a long walk to see.",
          "We went for the full hour. Great show. Excellent choreography. Not too busy. Well worth the visit. Good and easy viewing spots.",
          "I found the show to be mildly impressive it not very entertaining. It's pretty for 5 minutes then it get boring",
          "Was a highlight of our Barcelona trip. Would recommend to go early and watch the show from the steps of the art museum. Was spectacular.",
          "I admit off the top that I did not visit the fountain during a time when you could appreciate it for its primary claim to fame, the evening light show. But it was still quite a sight. Towering over everything and everyone around it and constantly changing in its patterns. It",
          "This is a fantastic free show. 45 mins of music to fountain show. We didn\u2019t sit, but stood close to the fountain. It was thrilling, we got a bit wet, but it was fun. The music is great and the colours, and water was beautiful. Highly recommend this show.",
          "The crowds were in the thousands at this fountain and the music of Queens lead singer Freddy Mercury was fitting",
          "Had a great spot at the front, expect to get a bit wet. The fountain display was well timed with the music, specially the Freddie Mercury songs. Loved it.",
          "Beautiful place, great view, but it can be a bit crowded. Nice place to visit, take some nice photos nd enjoy the fountain show at night.",
          "Sorry, but I'm disappointed by a fountain that has no water! It was day time so we already knew we wouldn't see the advertised light show, but really, can't they at least run the fountain during the day? We were there on a festival weekend, lots of people around, but no water!",
          "You should notg to miss that show. Thousands of people waits every night at 21h to see this show of water, lights and music.",
          "Brilliant show, it is set to music however we could not hear it that well and the traffic also passes by. Get there early to get a good spot",
          "Lots of crowds and if you have enjoyed fountains of Las vegas Bellagio or Dubai Mall area you would be disappointed",
          "This is a great evening show and a must see for travelers to Barcelona. The fountains and their sycoronous show with music are magical. Get there very early - seating is limited and the tour busses dump hundreds of fellow travelers there over an hour prior to the first show.",
          "We were impressed by all the different colors and the backdrop of the art and buildings and also the musicians that were around this area. Quite delightful.",
          "The Magic Fountain is located in Montjuic area, close to Espanya Square, in Barcelona, the main city of Catalonia. At night, you can see a show with water, colours and music in this place. Really, it is very beautiful. In fact, it is one of the typical places in Barcelona, where",
          "We got to the fountain half an hour before the show began, and it was a little late to arrive. If you want the best places to sit come at least an hour before and bring yourself some wine and snacks. When the show begun the area was packed!! Strangely after the first 15-30",
          "On a night tour of Barcelona, the fountain was one of the stops (and the highlight of the tour). Beautiful show!",
          "Beautiful fountains in Barcelona. the surrounded park is beautiful to walk through and see Barcelona from above. Unfortunately when we where there no fountain show took place.",
          "It was my best evening exper ience in Barcelona.When the show started we all had goose bumps.Maybe the music was too quiet. Go there and enjoy.",
          "A must experience when in Barcelona. The water/colour/music combination was beautiful. Just make sure on what days and at what time the show is. The water show is not on every evening, and it differs every season.",
          "Truly amazing. Get there early as it gets very busy. Dont make th mistake of sitting on th edge of th steps in th middle as you'll get wet when th fountains start !! An hours worth of water displays to music and light. A must visit in Barcelona...",
          "The display of water jets, light and colour and varied water pressure to music is something not to be missed. It is popular and there is collective appreciation of this creation.",
          "Was luckily staying within walking distance of the fountain as it is not a long show. There were thousands of people there, but it can be seen from many different places - even from quite far away. It was lovely; the height of the water and colours made me gasp a few times. I",
          "Started with Freddie Mercury\u2019s Barcelona not loud enough for me but still great the fountain and lights are something not to be missed when visiting Barcelona",
          "Travelled over 45 minutes to visit the magic fountain and was extremely disappointed to find that the fountain wasn't even on at all so was just an empty fountain - on the plus side we saw the columns which made it a bit better but the information on this is very poor - check",
          "The fountain was closed for repairs. Not sure when it will reopen! It was still a nice walk from downtown but it would have been nice if the fountain was running.",
          "'must-see' in Barcelona. Quite close to Catalonia Platz, in the evenings (not every day - must check) the spectacular fountains 'dancing' into music. Very crowded place, but worthwhile to see.",
          "The magic fountain is an fantastic show of light and sound combined with diferent textires and shapes created by the water. It is a free show and it is worth to do it. I have never seen such a well done and long( one hour) water show!",
          "It is a spectacular dancing fountain. It operates every Thursday, Friday and saturday at 20:oo in winter. Go early if you really want to enjoy it",
          "We got there early and had great seats. Met some people seated next to us and had a great time watching the show. The fountains were spectacular, but enjoyed the atmosphere as well. It was crowded, but really conducive for meeting people, kind of like a party.",
          "Read the schedule carefully - it\u2019s not easy to understand. Lots of people went in vain. US too \ud83d\ude14Perhaps the online informations are better.",
          "A large square in the centre of Barcelona with beautiful fountains and an ideal meeting place. Surrounded by shops, shopping centres and eateries",
          "Visited the fountains during a family trip. Wouldn't waste time with them to be honest. Arent that impressive and arent timed to the music or lights. Music is so quiet compared to the sound of the water you have to strain to hear what song is playing. Music is all very dated",
          "We stopped here for about 20 minutes while on a bicycle tour. We drank some Cava and enjoyed the light show and music while watching the fountains. Rivals the Bellagio in Las Vegas.",
          "It was an enjoyable experience to see the fountains turn colors along with the music that played. It is very crowded but there is ample seating or standing areas.",
          "We went before dinner (9pm). Arrive a little early, a lot early if you want to bring snacks and drinks and hang out in a good viewing spot. Huge crowds, but fun light show with fountain water and music. Very enjoyable evening. Thursday-Sunday only.",
          "After all of my pre-trip research, I only found out about this from our taxi driver. Neat experience for all ages (but there are a lot of smokers, so be ready to change spots if you\u2019re sensitive). We copped a squat on the stairs in front of the museum at the top of the hill.",
          "Well worth the visit and it's free!! Amazing show, make sure you arrive early to avoid the massive crowds.",
          "Stunning and magical place, beautiful architecture and amazing atmosphere a real must go, reserve a couple of hours sit and relax :)",
          "Amazing show! It's so beautiful, the music is good. It's a lot crowded but we manage to be on front. It's magical indeed! It's a must when in Barcelona",
          "Magnificent! Great entertainment that costs absolutely nothing. Our show started at 9pm and continued to 9.30pm. We were informed but our tour guide thsy they run well into the night! Go see them!!",
          "We 'were impressed with Barcelona as a city and it's giving/gifting of many open spaces and beauty. The fountain of 'dancing waters' in colour and music was delightful. The only thing we anticipated but never happened, is better outdoor restaurants at the fountain. It was",
          "A great way to end a long day in Barcelona. The show is great, but the view of the city at night at the top is simply breathtaking.",
          "Went there early, but still all the best positions directly behind the fountain taken. It\u2019s not really an issue, as wherever you stand, you can see comfortably. For those unable or unwilling to stand for long periods, get there early or be prepared to sit on the grass, walls or",
          "Must visit the music show in tune with the water!! Take something warm as you can get slightly wet from the fountain. Very busy but a must visit!",
          "So our first night in Barcelona, our cab driver told us this was the only night during our stay we could see the Magic Fountains. Our tour director Darko was happy to arrange taxis. The surprise was that fountains along two blocks also began, toward the end of the main show.",
          "On our guided bike ride we stopped in this park and got a look at this great fountain. There are some tourists here, but it doesn't ruin a great experience. Recommended!",
          "We went to the evening show of fountains and music, it was stunning and had a great vibe with the many people watching",
          "check out the evening displays at 9pm and 10pm, but get there early as it is worse that Sydney Harbor on NYE",
          "Arrive early to get a great view . Simply stunning watching the display of the various water spouts and listening to the beautiful music .",
          "We went of a Sunday evening and despite it raining the display was one of beauty. Defiantly worth a visit, we chose to go at night time as the light show would be more vibrant than during the day. Very glad we did. A note of caution watch your handbags etc as we noticed police",
          "Great views from the top during the day and escalators to get you up there :) Saw the magic fountains from the top of the nearby shopping mall - well worth a visit both day and night",
          "Crowded but wonderful! I couldn\u2019t believe how they made that water dance and change colors to the music like that! It was wonderfully entertaining and...magical!",
          "The spectacle is not breathtaking, the srroundings are very impressive. The thing that imressed us the most is the amount of people who gather every evening!",
          "We got there 30 minutes early and the place was already packed so I would recommend at least an hour before showtime. It's very beautiful and we wish we could have explored more of the area it's in as it also seemed to be very nice.",
          "Get ready. Its an eye feast to see this magical foundation. Its a spectacular show of lights, sound and dancing fountain. Tip: arrive there early to get the best spot to view and record. Usually starts 9:30pm so be there an hour earlier. No nearby toilets so visit the loo first",
          "It was fascinating for the 20 minutes that we watched. The fountains and colors were constantly changing! Crowded but worth it.",
          "You need to be here at least an hour before to get a good spot, so take snacks and drinks. Really pretty lit up fountains in time to music. The music could be a bit louder to have more effect though. Well worth a visit!",
          "Worth the visit. Tourist and locals come to watch the fountains. Lots of families there. Security was high. We had to watch from across the street and we arrived 30 minutes early. The crowds were unbelievable. Bus groups were being dropped off. However, everyone was",
          "its was a show to remember, the whole atmosphere was beyond amazing , the fountain , the lights and the cheerful crowd made this a memorable experience",
          "Magic Fountain show starts at night and lots of people attend to it. Water/lighs/sound synchronization is good and worths the visit. Music should be louder and of better quality to improve the experience of the show.",
          "The magic fountain of Madrid! Open only on weekends nights and holidays!! 30 minutes of synchronized music with the water fountain!! Ahhh!!!! Beatles music , all kinds of music! Pop,rock , indie!! Music!!",
          "Definitely worth seeing on the last day of the festival La Mercer! Absolutely brilliant! More than 30 mins of fireworks, music and fountain show!",
          "Maybe it was just the night that we went. It was packed at 830 even though it didn\u2019t start until 930. At 925, the fountains warmed up. They played one song then took a 2 minute pause. They picked back up and ran straight into the 10 show but w different music. I enjoyed it",
          "The fountains were ok. but not fantastic, massively packed in, we had to leave before the show finished as the traffic afterwards would have been horrendous.",
          "Well worth the walk to see this display of light, colour and sound. Be prepared to get wet if you stand near the front!",
          "Daria did a terrific job with a Drive by tour of most notable parts of Barcelona. Over the 2+ hours on the open bus, (weather & temp permitting); you have a good working knowledge of both Antoni Gaudi influence, and the historical background of a city founded by Romans in",
          "It is a divine experience for the people who love water and fountains. When it starts, music and water are synchronized excellent and the choreography is excellent. This show starts in the evening at 21.30 and lasts for an 1 hour. Too pity that during the day fountain does",
          "Pretty good, not near the best I've seen but nice to see if it's on the way to an attraction or if you stayed nearby",
          "My friend and I went to see the magic fountain show and were a little disappointed. We waited 45 minutes in the crowds of people for the show to start, and when it did, we were less than impressed. It\u2019s a fountain. With water. And some cool lights. And random music. The music",
          "Truly a unique experience! We thought it was going to be a quick show but it ended up being 45 min. The music was diverse as it was classical to pop. There was so many people that it covered the steps and the fountain. Thankfully the fountain was large enough to be seen from all",
          "Spectacular colored fountain displays with music, classical to pop. It lasts 9:30-10:30 PM. which is pretty long. Best place to view is on the steps. Take the escalator up on the side. If by the fountain, be prepared to get misted. Fun thing to do with family and friends.",
          "We went 2 nights in a row, Thursday and Friday, the weather was fantastic, the music lovely. Take food and drink and have an evening picnic. Loved it",
          "We got to the Magic fountains about 10 in the evening. There was probably over a 1000 people around. However we stayed and wonder around till we found and stop to watch, Well worth the stay. We were there for 2 hrs and they were still going. WOW!",
          "Very enjoyable evening waterfountain- light-music-show between 21-22 o'clock (depends on season). Gets always very crowded (be careful of pickpockets!)",
          "I had included this activity to surprise my 10 years daughter after a tired day in the area but it wasn't worth the stay. Average for us but yonger kids might find interesting. Good thing it was free but lot of people.",
          "Great show. It's been several years since I last seen it and it was different than what I recalled. It was good to go back so many years. The kid also enjoyed it.",
          "This was a surprising experience. When we went to see the fountain there were tons of people there, music playing the lights of the fountain, and people singing and dancing. So much fun!",
          "Great show of water, lights and music. You cant miss this spectacular show specially for the kids. You need to be there at least one hour in advance but the wait is worth it",
          "I felt that it was a great thing to see, but if I had to travel a considerable distance to it, I'd be left disappointed. The water effects were fairly standard, nothing amazing. Would be great to take the kids though and stand close so you all get a bit wet in the wind!",
          "Have been here before and made sure we allowed time to see it again. Show started a few mins late but went on for over an hour - maybe best to find somewhere to sit to watch - there are some steps going up the slope. Beware - you can get wet if you're too close and the wind is",
          "Highly recommend coming to watch this! It's not as synch'd to the music as say the Bellagio in Las Vegas, but the colour and light combination is wonderful!",
          "As most of the other reviews state any trip to Barcelona would not be complete without a trip to the 'Magic Fountain'. Best viewed in the dark the display has music for all ages and tastes with fantastic lighting and water effects. The whole displsay was breathtaking and quite",
          "This show of the dancing fountains was one of the best things to see in Barcelona and it is free the music was brilliant as well and the atmosphere was really good",
          "Really one if the greatest places in Spain! Advice to come earlier, as it's very crowded when it starts at 21.30. Better be there at 21:00 at least",
          "Worth an hour of your time one evening to watch the fountains light up in different colors and \"dance\" to the music",
          "I've been to see the Magic Fountain three times now and it is always fantastic, I'd never have thought a fountain could be so impressive. Basically it is like a firework show but with water instead of fireworks! Be sure to check when the shows are as it does not operate every",
          "We didn't know what to expect when we went to see the fountains, but we actually really enjoyed it! Its free too. It went on for an hour, 9:30-10:30, and was packed - alot more people there than we imagined. But we got a good spot. There are people selling drinks and the",
          "A fun display of lights, music and water at night time. Very crowded but still possible to get a good view",
          "Yeah this one is not a solid three, but also it is not a four. But the grading system aside, the fountain show is totally ok, the problem though is that this attracts very much people! And they also show up early, so I guess so should you, if you want a great spot. Also there is",
          "This was a lovely fountain in the city and us well worth a look. In an. Attractive part of town too. On a hot summer's day it was a cool. Attraction. Barcelona has much to admire including this attractive fountain.",
          "The fountains are spectacular we arrived early not sure you needed to do this as great viewing spots and not overcrowded. Remember if the wind blows and you are close you might get wet.",
          "This is totally free and a must if in Barcelona! The atmosphere is buzzing, very popular! The shows in summer run from 9:30pm-10:30pm in 20 minute intervals. If you\u2019re on a budget in Barca this is a good option!",
          "Our hotel was somewhat close by. We viewed the property during the day and then had the opportunity to go back at night during a festival. Beautiful at night with all the lighting !!! ( that coming from someone in the lighting industry). It is probably one of the largest",
          "Beautiful and free show Its very beautiful and its awesome to see the amount of people that get together to see it and the happyness on the children`s faces,",
          "Quite spectacular fountain. The volume of water was impressive. Less variation but just as enjoyable when compared to the one in Dubai. Especially with the beautiful building in the background. Very very busy though. It is difficult to find a standing spot. It might be better to",
          "A top thing to do in Barcelona. If you really want a good seat, do get there early, but we arrived about 20 mins before the first show and just sat on the floor, right up close (literally within splashing distance! More of a light mist than a soaking, tbf). Was wondering what",
          "I wasn\u2019t expecting to be so impressed by the fountains, water cascading don to different levels and the colourful fountains at the bottom. Lots of people but easy to get up close for photos. Don\u2019t buy drinks and food at the top cafe, what ripoff prices. Too late we discovered",
          "The Magic Fountain is a must do when visiting Barcelona. There are not many thing free there but this is beautiful and amazing and cost nothing. You need to arrive early if you want the best view",
          "What a spectacular sight. A lot of work has gone into this free spectacle. The show is 1 hour of pure entertainment. Male sure you get there early for best views.",
          "I\u2019ve visited this fountain twice now - there\u2019s an amazing atmosphere for the build up with local dancers putting on a show. There are toilets and food and drinks stalls around too. It\u2019s a free attraction but make sure you get there early so that you can get a good spot and seat",
          "First time to experience a dancing fountain with on going fountain on 2 lanes of the street. It was remarkably unbelievable and beautiful",
          "We went on a Thursday evening for the first display having postponed our plans the night before after an unexpected rain storm. Got there early, and the steps unto the Palau Nacional and the area immediately around the main fountain were already very full. So we stood",
          "Nice show with lights, music and the wonderful fountain. It's free so I really recommend going there to take a look.",
          "Imagine thousands of people around a colorful fountain which spreads water in extreme highs, while listening to famous songs. This is the show of magic fountain. I have been twice in Barcelona and this was something I watched again and it was as spectacular as I remembered.",
          "Honestly left after about 10 minutes. Maybe it get some better...but I wasn\u2019t super super impressed. I got there about an hour early to get a good spot and I would definitely not wait that long again. Might be worth stopping by after dinner on your way home but wouldn\u2019t make a",
          "Enjoy the fountains day or night: refreshing to watch in the heat of the day and lovely colors in the evening.",
          "Get there early to get a good view otherwise you will be amongst the crowd. Some people left after 20 minutes so we moved to the steps. Lots of touts selling cheap tat and the blanket sellers were out in force (amazed at how quickly they scooped and ran when a couple of police",
          "The fountain and architecture of the city are beautiful but the experience is spoiled due to pickpocket gangs and bag snatches. You have to constantly be on guard and never let go of your bag. You're not safe even in the shops.",
          "We saw the fountain during the day ad also in the evening when it got dark and it was so much better then! All the lights and the music are amazing. It was great to see this and we took some really nice pictures there. Recommended",
          "We came here a few days ago and this was our second visit! It\u2019s just magical! The water, lights and music altogether is so beautiful and majestic! It also lasts around An hour and half. I would highly recommend doing this on your visit here if you come. It made it extra",
          "It is not often when on a city break that you get a chance to view one of the attractions for free. We visited twice, once during the day , climbing the steps up to the museum and enjoying the views and the Beauty of the gardens and fountains. Then again at night to see the the",
          "The fountain is pretty big yes but asides from that it is not very spectacular to look upon. Went there and past it several times",
          "This is a must see if you are in Barcelona. Make sure to check online for the schedule and arrive early to find a nice spot to sit on the stairs.",
          "These fountains are amazing. They start at 9.30pm Thursday, Friday, Saturday & Sunday and are definitely not to be missed. They are on for around 1 hour with music and lights. The street leading up to them also has fountains which come on at the same time as the main one. It",
          "Bit crowded and beware of pickpockets but overall a charming experience - spectacular light & music show. Don\u2019t miss!",
          "Exciting for the first 30 minutes, but you get wet and move back, where the music and atmosphere is lost.",
          "Yes its a nice spectacle, yes the fountain is cool, yes the backdrop of buildings at night is unique. BUT, for me, way too many people and we knew there were pickpockets there. What was worse were these unlicencesed chancers selling those ridiculous toys whi ypu catapult into",
          "It is crowded ! But it\u2019s is festive and not hard to find a sitting spot on the steps. It is right next to the art center. It\u2019s the art center that has amazing photo op at night time .",
          "Great Water Fountain Show. The best place to sit is the steps one level higher from the fountain. Initially we could not find a spot there but some people started to leave about 15 to 20 min into the show.",
          "Got there just before dark and waited as hundreds of people arrived ... was not disappointed as the atmosphere and music were magical",
          "We lived near Placa Espana so a visit to the Font Magica is very convenient after a long day. We went around 20:30 and stayed there for about an hour enjoying the water fountain dancing in tune to various classical music.",
          "Absolutely Brilliant Arrive early get a seat and enjoy the View for the light show on every evening! Such a great free attraction! We had dinner up at the bullring before hand which is a 5 minute walk away.",
          "I went with Disney aficionados and I think they were disappointed. The lighting and water display was wonderful but it was let down by poor audio so the whole effect was diminished . If you want to hear and see best then I think you need to be on right side overpass as you are",
          "Super view from top. The fountain was huge with nice setup. Great to see during night. Should eb there at specific time to take the experience.",
          "We had been told that the Magic Fountain was a \"must see\" in Barcelona. While we understood that the evening is the best time to go when the lights are on we were unable to go then so went for a daytime visit instead, expecting to at least see the water ... Sadly, there was",
          "This is a classic must see in Barcelona. There are multiple shows that include varying water cannons from the fountains arranged to music with varying light colors. Large crowds so expect lots of unregistered or unlicensed sales of products. This is family friendly and take",
          "Free to watch, extremely busy with coach loads of people, a bit over rated if you\u2019ve already seen fountain shows elsewhere, show starts at 9:30pm for about an hour, toilets and refreshments available. If you haven\u2019t seen a fountain show before then this is a very good one to see",
          "Used the hop on hop off bus to get to the art museum on Montjuic, the views down across the city of Barcelona and the fountain are incredible, we walked from the Art museum down the the arena at the bottom, took many photos of the fountain on the way. At night tho is is all lit",
          "A free sight: fontana magica- close to placa Espanya on Tursdays to Sunday from 9.30 to 11.00 - the fountain changes its light and form all the time for 30 minutes. Really awesome! Don\u2019t miss it",
          "A lovely nights free and relaxing entertainment watching the spectacular and colourful fountain display. On the down side its very crowded but standing on one of the pedestrian road bridges on the approach gives a good and clear view.",
          "We watched the Magic 'Dancing Water' show one evening that we were in Barcelona. It was very fun to watch! Get there early to get a good spot to enjoy the show!",
          "I have no words to say! The fountain show that lasts for about one hour is amazing! Throughout the show the fountain changes colours and shapes. There are also songs playing in the background that create a relaxing atmosphere! It is really worth it and is also FREE. You hardly",
          "We got here early..or we thought we had! The place was jam packed!!! We ended up standing on the side where the wind blew the water on us! It wasn't even a windy evening! It was so fun to watch the colorful waters dance to the music! And hilarious when we all got sprayed! Go see",
          "All you have to do is to gather up by 9:30 around the fountain and see the magical water dance to music. It is in one of the centers of Barcelona, so it is easy to access it.",
          "Beautiful fountains and a must do in an evening in Barcelona. Kids had a great time ! Would go again",
          "Very impressive and busy. Were lucky enough to see the display accompanied by Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Cabelle singing Barcelona. Well worth a visit, get there early if you want a high vantage point but ringside is great and refreshingly spray.",
          "The fountain is very beautiful but it gets so crowded before it has even started so it\u2019s hard to get a good view. It lasts 30 minutes but you can really just watch 5 minutes to appreciate it",
          "we stumbled upon montjuic fountains by accident and we are very glad we did. the light show was incredible and lasted a whole hour.",
          "This was just around the corner from our hotel and when we arrived the fountain wasnt on but bit by bit they all came to life, amazing. We would want to go back at night to get the full effect.",
          "We were told not to leave Barcelona without seeing the foundations. So glad we did. Arrived early where there were boy dancers to keep us entertained. The show was amazing we were near the front so got a bit wet but worth it. Suitable for all ages I had 3 teenagers with me and",
          "We chose not to walk down to the plaza. We sat on the steps behind the four columns. They were kind of in the way but it didn\u2019t really matter. The only thing that we missed was that we could barely hear the music. I really think that we had a better view of the fountain. If",
          "Didn't understand how cool this would be until we saw it in person...this was amazing! It was gorgeous and beautiful, and every angle of this area was a phenomenal view. Get there early, sitting room fills up quick. Perfect romantic spot and the best nightcap",
          "It is a huge fountain and it can shape the water so differently. Additional there is music but the music coordinated with the fountain. Nice atmosphere in the evenings. The art museum and al the other waterfalls are also lightend",
          "a great idea but packed with hundreds of people and the sound wasnt that good. I guess that if the sound would have been louder the experience would have been much better.",
          "Did not know about the fountain show but arrived the right day. Really well done. A typical example of if you pour enough mo et into such a show you can get a great result Well worth the walk up to see it",
          "Cascading from high above down steps set too music with lights go with a tour group is better ours was a small group tour",
          "Magnifiscent fountain which is beautiful in daylight as well as in the evening. Trafic usually is heavy, so don't expect a tranquil scene.",
          "I'll be honest - I really didn't expect much at all. But it's superb! It's well worth planning your arrival time to suit your level of concern with the viewing arrangements. We arrived for the start of an August Friday display about 40 minutes beforehand - to find several",
          "We watched the fountain show on a crowded Sunday night. There was plenty of room for everyone to have a good view. The show had lots of beautiful colors and patterns, but the music had no rhythm or correlation to the lights. This show is nice, but the fountain show at the",
          "We arrived just after 10 pm on Friday, August 31. We really enjoyed the portion of the show we saw, which ended just past 10:30, after which they turned off the water and light for all the surrounding fountains. A municipal worker we asked said the the show runs from 9 to 10:30",
          "All of the local people we met in Barcelona urged us to go to the \"Magic Fountains\" show. We finally did on an evening when we didn't have any other plans and were sure glad that we did! It was an amazing play of water and lights and music that reminded me of a firework show.",
          "The fountains are a piece of a great architectural ensemble. The main fountain is big and powerful, with a lot of various jets - that also creates a pleasant fresh atmosphere in a hot spanish evenings around. But the place around gets too busy, so it is difficult to get the good",
          "A nice to end the evening event! Have an early dinner then venture over early. Scheduled to start around 9:30 but plan to arrive at least 45 minutes early if you plan to fins a place to sit. It is a sIt on the stairs or ground event. The vendors are quite annoying so bring",
          "Beautiful display of lights, water and music. It lasted 15 minutes and it was super crowded. Not easy to maneuver with small children. More suited to adults and young adults.",
          "The fountain itself is nothing special and the are certainly more impressive and ornate ones around the world. However it\u2019s about the experience. It wasn\u2019t overly crowded but if you need or want to sit down you need to get there early. The best place to sit is on the steps",
          "It was a Magical Experience. Another favourite in Barcelona was Sant Pau, now a UNESCO heritage site, it was once a hospital.",
          "We had to leave halfway through due to our tour bus leaving but would highly recommend. Very atmospheric and dramatic",
          "It is a beautiful and magical show! Really impressive and really really colourful. If you want to watch the entire show, you should definitely be there 45 minutes before it starts in order to find a place to sit. It gets really crowded so be prepared. Definitely worth it!",
          "Beautiful light show and much bigger and more impressive than it looks in photos! We arrived 45 minutes before the show and really struggled to find a place to sit because it was so busy! Make sure you get there at least an hour before if you want really good seats. The show is",
          "we went here a little before sunset. We explored the sight of the 1992 Olympics then watched the sun set from the top of Montjuic. As it became dark, more and more people settled in around the Fountains. It is about a 20 minute music and lights presentation. We left after",
          "A very underrated attraction in Barcelona. The fountain is very impressive and the background setting is spectacular.",
          "Nice, but sincerely, I think it has lost glamour. Good for children, some minutes of music and coloured light water dancing. It's worth to close a long city visiting. Relaxing, sometimes a little crowed. The fountain is from 1929, renewed on 2015. For cars,Parking paying.",
          "You don\u2019t get much for free these days, luckily this is one thing that is free and it\u2019s great. It was very busy, but you can see the fountains from quite a distance so no need to worry about being right up close. I think the fountain and light display is on every night, but",
          "I was surprised to see a fountain to be so high on the attraction list, but we had a great time. With that said we had a great time. Kids didn't want to leave, hoping it will continue longer. It was a ton of people but because it was so high it was still visible to everyone.",
          "The Magic Fountain is a free show and definitely worth the viewing. The water fountains are lit up in sync with the music. Go early to get a good spot.",
          "We like the lights of the fountains and Love the introduction with Freddy Mercury song Barcelona. Love the Strauss music no sure about more contemporary one. Lights were good, needs significant improvement on sound and also limiting street sellers",
          "All my family loved the fountain show. Thousands of people were all around enjoying the fountain lit up and music. Fantastic and free. A must see.",
          "I went there with family and it was very beautiful. The view. The architecture. All was very nice. We had fun.",
          "A beautiful area with museums and parks, but the fountains at night take the cake, the colour and music and they start from the top all the way down the street which provide for a spectacular sight.",
          "The fountains are spectacular and well worth a visit before you leave Barcelona. The show starts at 9.30pm, I recommend you arrive one hour before to get a seat on the steps over looking the fountains. I visited twice, and would certainly recommend sitting on the steps. At the",
          "When in Barcelona leave an evening to enjoy this beautiful fountain. If you are in the Montjuic area make a day of it. There's plenty to see and a large shopping centre formerly a bull ring, where you can shop till you drop an eat as well. The glory is the fountain but get there",
          "This is a beautiful area and the show really is a must see. Don't get obsessed with trying to find a good spot - you can wander around to different sides during the show. We just enjoyed the atmosphere and general scenery as much as the fountains and music. However you do need",
          "Amazing show on display not to be missed. And it's free!!! It's a must-see in Barcelona. Shows last for 1 hour in summer time. \ud83d\udcaf",
          "Show is way too quiet. The fountain is super gorgeous but overall it\u2019s not exciting. Easy to get to by train which is nice but choose the beach instead",
          "I went there at night and the show start at 21:30 it\u2019s really such amazing place to see How they play with the water and changes lights it\u2019s makes you feel that you are in another world , such a nice music which give the real feeling to enjoy . I recommend to visit this place on",
          "The show is good but the music should be louder. Try to get their minimum one hour before the show so you can find a place to sit.",
          "I'm sure it's really nice - we were really looking forward to seeing it, only it wasn't operating during our visit! I think potentially it doesn't operate during the winter months? Very disappointing that we couldn't see it. We're grateful that at least we've seen the",
          "We arrived early but definitely not early enough there were thousands of people already in the area and as show time grew nearer the crowd increased. As we waited there was a troupe of rap dancers who did a performance and some vendors selling water and beer. The water and",
          "What a beautiful feature to simply stand and stare. The night time displays are apparently amazing so it was a shame we visited during the day.",
          "Always the same songs and the same show, for years and years. Be carefull with pickpockets too. On the other hand is a complex machinery from the XIX century",
          "I've mostly gone on special occasions, usually for the local festivities of Barcelona (Festes de la Merc\u00e8), and I admit it offers a nice show. It's not a huge fountain, but it's nice to watch if they've prepared some special show.",
          "It's probably much more fun - and magical - with kids.The crowd to enjoyment ratio didn't cut it for me. It's cool, but not must-see. The music is horrible. Go stand by the street musicians instead of right next to the fountain for a better experience for your ears.",
          "We went on the Sunday and managed to get a good vantage point 40 minutes before the start. It gets busy. The wait was worth it as the display was hugely impressive.",
          "This was a free night entertainment. The magic light at the fountain. From 9:30 pm to 10:30 pm. Get there early so you can hear the music to the water works of the fountain plus the way they play with colour. This runs only from Sunday night to Wednesday night so make sure you",
          "It's a beautiful show with some great music. It gets very busy early on but we managed to get a spot right by the fountain to observe.",
          "We arrived 15 minutes before it started and the place was swarmed with sooo many people. It was really hard to find a spot that you could see it clearly. It was nice to see but it isn't something I'd say is a must do.",
          "Great free light and music display, different era of music every night. Get there early if you want a front row view.",
          "Went to see this on our first night in Barcelona. It was pretty and we watched it for about five minutes, then decide to leave. It got quite boring very quick. The sheer number of people is what put me off. There were thousands of people there to see them. It was awful. It was",
          "We were doing a huge loop of Barcelona starting from the castle and working our way down. We timed the fountain just right to get there for the show. The water is timed to music and it is very entertaining.",
          "The fountains start at 9:30 pm 5 days per week. They are in front of the National Museum wich is an impressive domed building.",
          "We viewed the Magic Fountain during the day from the steps of the Museum (Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya - MNAC) during the day and it was lovely.... but at night (look up online for the seasonal schedule)... it was Amazing!!! The lights and the water were in sync with the",
          "Great show really amazing to see definitely worth a visit. Display starts approximately 9.30pm so get there early to get a decent view. Avoid the guys selling sangria as our tour operator warned us you don't know where it has come from ,where the ice cubes are from! A couple of",
          "The lighting used in the evening is very well done. We were there during pride week and the fountain looked great.",
          "It was really worth the wait. Make sure to be early to get a nice vantage point. It\u2019s very crowded and hence you have to be aware of your personal belongings at all times",
          "We travelled here by metro, the stop is quite close. A security man warned us to watch our bags - a good idea anywhere in Barcelona as someone tried to get into my husbands backpack on the metro the day before, I think he may have regretted that move! The place is crowded, get",
          "No matter how cynical you are, it\u2019s hard to avoid enjoying this. Sure, there\u2019s probably better high-tech stuff out there, but between its historical significance, and its beauty, it\u2019s like watching liquid fireworks. We walked up there from our hotel The Brummell. It was",
          "We were staying in an apartment just around the corner from the Magic Fountains so went to see them one evening. We could not believe how many people there were and were not disappointed by show which was dazzling and it\u2019s FREE.",
          "This is a lovely way to spend the evening. Easy to get there from the metro but do get there a good 45-60 minutes early if you want a decent space to sit on the stairs. Otherwise you can just stand nearby. There\u2019s people walking round selling sangria, beer and water which helps",
          "Absolutely fantastic with the opening music Freddie Mercury and Montserrat the display was mind boggling. Incredible performance.",
          "Located in one of the touristic areas of Barcelona, near to metro station \"Plaza de Espa\u00f1a\". You can enjoy this fantastic fountain show with lights and music. You can see this show just in front of the fountain or from upper side (just to Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) and",
          "We went there in the morning and it was closed then at night it started you can enjoy the light show and the water show it\u2019s amazing",
          "Had not planned to go, but really glad we did. Amazing fountain and an experience everyone would appreciate. Lots of people take that in to consideration if you go be Metro",
          "The most breathtaking show I have ever seen. Totally worth the trek out to Montjuic. We got a front row seat and were glad we did. We got absolutely drenched but it was the most amazing experience. Lots of other things to see in the area as well so would be worth getting here a",
          "Free to visit but get there early to sit on terrace and check website for when shows on as not everyday",
          "Worth seeing if you are around Barca! The show was on for about an hour and many people were watching! Close to shops and taxis and there was food stalls whilst it was on.",
          "Arrived early and it got extremely busy so I would suggest to be able to sit down that is the key , the show is very good and fantastic that it is free",
          "Very impressive fountains. We arrived about an hour before the fountains started, and it was quiet, but was absolutely packed by the end. If you want to get a good view, make sure to get there early! One of the best things to do in Barcelona.",
          "We visited the Magic Fountain on a Saturday afternoon - the MNAC is free on Saturday afternoons and is open until 8pm, and the steps on the MNAC are a great observation point far above the croups (and pick pockets) around the fountain.",
          "I saw this on my first night in the city, I arrived 1.5 hours before the first show and there were already people waiting. I sat on the steps opposite the fountain, make sure you sit in the middle and not at the edges as people will sit on the walls and make it hard for you to",
          "Found this on the guide recommendations Was free but be sure your get right days its not on every day Really amazing display",
          "Experience magic of lights and sound synched to the majestic fountain at Montjuic. Need to be there an hour early as crowds gather quickly.",
          "Went to Plaza de Espanya to watch the fountain. A very colorful sight with lights and music. Lot of crowds of all ages filled the whole gallery of steps from the top. Some thing to visit in the night.",
          "It\u2019s a great thing, good music and spectacle but there are so many people there it\u2019s difficult to get close unless you get there early.",
          "These fountains are in Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya and provide a wonderful water and light display. Take the glass lift up to the top of Las Arenas de Barcelona shopping mall and walk around the 360 degree roof terrace filled with restaurants. This is not to be missed in Barcelona.",
          "The fountain is amazing but the show itself is very poor, you can barely hear any music. It's basically a colorfull fountain that dances withiut music. If you've seen the one in Vegas or the one in Dubai you'll be very disappointed in this one.",
          "We mooched about here after coming back from the disappointing Montjuic Castle. The fountains would be a good place to just chill and people watch if it wasn\u2019t for the annoying sellers trying to sell you lukewarm beers and bottled water every minute and I\u2019m not even",
          "Went there on our visit to Barcelona on a Friday evening. The show starts at 9.30 but this can vary depending on the time of the year (check online for timings). People start flocking there around an hour before. There was an enormous amount of people. If you get there early",
          "Very busy but still managed to get good views. Added bonus is that this a rare attraction where there is no entry fee. On a hot summer night in Barcelona, I found the whole experience unmissable!!",
          "We got to the park about 10 minutes before the show started. It was definitely very crowded but also neat to watch. After about 20 minutes, the crowd thinned out and we went to get seats. And the guys walking around selling beer came in handy. (and the price goes down the longer",
          "I was in the neighborhood because I went to that terrible club La Terrazza so I strolled down the hill with my group to the Magic Fountain. Little did I know there is very limited set times that the fountain will go off so make sure you check online before heading there or else",
          "On a recent visit to Barcelona we had go to see The magic fountain .They only hold showings on Thura Fri Sat ....not sure about sunday ? What a wonderful sight it was ,i was deeply moved by its magical charm , the ambience was equally just as awesome. We arrived at 8.30pm to",
          "This felt like a miniature version of the fountains at the Bellagio in Vegas. You need to get there early to get the best views for your camera though.",
          "Show starts 9.30pm for 1 hour, water dances to music with hi Tec lighting. Lots of people visit so get there early for a step to sit on. Be aware of pick pockets while taking pics.",
          "Delightful nighttime fountain show with beautiful colors. Mesmerizing and fun. Definitely worth going!!",
          "We had to see the fountain in Barcelona and we went one eaving to reserve a place for the show and it was fantastic. The show is reealy great, music, colours and water in a great combination. The entrance is free and I would recommend to go onehour before the show to get a nice",
          "The show was breathtaking. Fountains were lighted and synchronized with music from a live orchestra. Well worth the visit",
          "We enjoyed the wonderful colours of this display. Crowds flock here in the evening but we still had a good view from a distance.",
          "OK, yes, this is a pretty cool thing to see. However it is totally overcrowded, the crowd filled with hawkers and pickpockets. The music is barely audible, poorly chosen, and completely unsynchronized with the fountains. The show at the Bellagio in Las Vegas is truly waaay",
          "Def worth a look, not quite The Bellagio in Vegas but we both really enjoyed it none the less. Get there is plenty of time to get a good spot.",
          "The view of the museum looked nice and nothing else was there to see, because museum was closed and the fountain wasn't working at a certain time. Apparently it's only working at 9 pm or 10pm, too bad because some people won't visit in the evenings. No near by toilets as well,",
          "Great in the evening when it is working and music is playing. Also great view when you step up the hill and nice are in general",
          "Was not expecting much but I loved it. Like watching fireworks without the bangs and with water not fire. Was treated to excellent local break dancing group before the fountains started they were excellent. Arrive early (more than 30 minutes), get a cold beer and a spot on the",
          "Definately worth visiting! Both the fountain and the museum are amazing to see. On a hot day make sure you have sunscreen or an umbrella.",
          "Light show was great, but pick pockets and male PIGS there too. I had to push a guy away from my friend. She was taking a picture in the dark, shoulder to shoulder with me and said she felt some one pushing up against her butt. Sure enough, this creepy stranger was pretending",
          "Nice water and light show at night, but it is too crowded. Go there if you happen to be near by, or if you are a fan of fountains. Otherwise, there are a lot more interesting things to see in Barcelona.",
          "Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t see it .I read on one site that it doesn\u2019t work on Monday so Iwent to see it on Tuesday to realize that it doesn\u2019t work on Tuesday neither . Many other tourist were like us and waited until dark to realize this.May be on my next visit.",
          "The magic fountain is somewhat similar to a vegas style show but also includes lights and other nearby fountains. Couple this with location and nearby architecture and you have an enjoyable 1-2 hours. Get there early for good seat, have a beer or sangria and take lots of",
          "Very pretty way to spend 30 minutes one evening. Be warned though as it is very crowded and everyone is filming the whole display, which for me ruined the experience slightly- all you could see in front of you were hundreds of phones being held up high...kind of spoilt the view!",
          "As water fountains go, this is pretty cool. We visited in the daytime so didn\u2019t see the light shows. Really good views over the city from the top. Worth a visit.",
          "The amount of people attending cut the romance. Also the whole show seems a little outdated. Can go if nearby, wouldn't travel for this.",
          "When you visit Barcelona make sure to visit this place during the show! It is not an everyday show i think, so you much plan for it. This is indeed a magical fountain, with the water and the colours changing according to the music. Don't miss it!",
          "Nice foundation and little outdoor cafe on site so you can sit and eat and watch the show. The staff were a bit grumpy but couldn't beat the setting.",
          "This is another one must-see in Barcelona, just take my advice and come early and take a sit on the stairs. I wish we had done that but we were a bit late for that. There were a lot of street performers to watch before the show started.",
          "Its a really Nice place. A mist see if you are in Barcelona. The only thing, it can be really difficult for people in wheel Chair and old people. You have a lot of stairs you need to climb before reaching the top.",
          "The fountain is amazing and beautiful but the vendors are constantly bugging you to buy stuff, especially if you have a kid with you. We were close. It might be better to try o find a spot further away.",
          "Is great to view, the show is one per day at 9:30pm from Wednesday to Sunday. But the music level is low. Can be reached easily in Metro",
          "A must see while in Barcelona. Like watching a firework display to music. Amazing. Even though it was heaving no problem finding a space to watch.",
          "Very crowded. Thought the fountains would dance to the music but they didn\u2019t seem to - the music was mostly pop songs. Was pretty but Disney do it better!",
          "Very impressive display, definitely worth the visit, specially seen as it\u2019s free. Cute little evening for couples and good for kids too. It is a very busy place so if you would like a decent place to sit, get there early and leave before it finishes to avoid mass crowds getting",
          "Simply beautiful a must see!!!! It is impressive and something out of this world. You must arrived before sundown, for it gets crowded. The show with Freddie Mercury Music in the background \"The Barcelona Theme\" is just incredible.",
          "Fountain is quite late for young kids (first show 9:30) but it\u2019s nice and quick so you can see the waterworks then escape quickly. Watch out for pickpockets and street sellers who pitch up just before it gets busy, you have to run the gauntlet to get back to the metro or",
          "This is well worth a visit during the evening. Amazing light show. It\u2019s gets very busy but well worth it.",
          "The fountain wasn't the Ain attraction for us. I believe if you do research, the best time to see this is in the evening. We went during mid day and the fountain was not fully flowing; although it was still very nice. Barcelona appears to come more alive in the evening when",
          "Beautiful show. The atmosphere surrounding the area is lively and fun. People of all ages were there. It was great.",
          "Another must visit in Barcelona but you need to be sure that it open that day , mostly only Thursday , Friday , Saturday except few month when it open on Wednesday too and we were lucky as we were in Barcelona from Sunday to Wednesday only . Beautiful fountain, light and music",
          "Breathtaking not to be missed .We took the local bus which was a lot cheaper than the tour company .Highly recommended",
          "I saw the 9:30pm show and it was breathtaking (if you like this sort of thing). If you plan to watch any of these shows during peak times, you have to get there pretty early to find a place to sit. Thousands of people show up; we sat down on the steps around 8pm and there were",
          "When I first heard about the fountain show, I immediately thought of the infamous one at Universal Studios that combines the water with film clips and music. In short, this was nothing like that. While they did play songs in the background, the water patterns didn't seem at all",
          "A very happy end to a day of sightseeing. Sitting and enjoying the fountain with all the colours was enjoyed by all of us.",
          "Great free entertainment. Impressive water and light show. Sounds a little trite but was actually quite spectacular and well worth the trip to see",
          "Must check the days of showi but its worth it, very nice place with a great show, one of the most liked place in the city.",
          "Must be the only free attraction in Barcelona. Great spectacle at dusk. Get there early and get a good vantage point. Attracts busy crowds. Be vigilant of pick pockets and street sellers. Too many operating in this area. Tip don\u2019t get too close, you may get wet!",
          "Beautiful fountains, loads of good emotions, vivid colours, lovely atmosphere when you are surrounded by all lovely people",
          "It\u2019s a free show and very dramatic but crowds gather early. Check the show times and get there 45 minutes early for a seat on the steps.",
          "Visting by night is the best time it is absolutely terrific get there early as there are very big crowds",
          "One of the highlights of my first trip in Barcelona. I truly enjoyed the show and thought it was a really magnificent thing to see after a hot summer day.",
          "So far nicest dancing fountains show i have ever seen . A but difficukt to get good viewing point if you are late or even on time but it worth!",
          "It was a great place that I recommend if you like to see harmony of Music and water The show was spectacular",
          "This is a VERY POPULAR event! I was surprised to see so many people there... I realized that the exodus would have been overwhelming so I didn't stay till the very end. I didn't want to get caught up in the crowd heading to the Metro!",
          "It\u2019s a fountain with lights and music - it\u2019s free and fun. We took some beers and enjoyed the hot summer night I think 2000 people were there so don\u2019t arrive at least 30 minutes before.",

          "Seeing the magic fountain while we were on our honeymoon was amazing, what an experience, we loved it!",
          "Been here twice, and both times it gave me a magical feeling especially when Freddie Mercury starts the \"Barcelona\" song. They play this nearly everyday and it is indeed a fab combination to offer this to public, free of charge. The place is always full, vibrant, happy, but",

          "I honestly don't see the hype. The fountains are nice, sure, but they weren't exactly synchronized to the music. I enjoy the Bellagio dancing fountains in Las Vegas more and I don't even like Las Vegas that much. But maybe that's just it. Barcelona has so much to offer, don't go",
          "Font M\u00e0gica de Montju\u00efc is a fountain that comes alive at night when there is a spectacular combined music, light and water fountain show.

          "This whole area is spectacular. Once the fountains start it is very busy but you can always find a spot to see them clearly. The fountains leading all the way up from Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina are beautiful. There are a lot of sellers with their goods laid out on",
          "very beautiful dancing waters, to music easy to relate to. A fun place to see, and free. Easy to get to by taxi, with good views from various locales nearby. Even with the lady streaker who was protesting for equality as it was Universal Pride day, it was enjoyable and worth",

          "We loved the magic fountain show that was a lovely way to end what was my birthday evening in Barcelona. Yes it gets VERY busy but if you get there nice and early, you can get a spot on the concrete on the walkovers or stairs which you can sit on and don\u2019t get bothered at all.",
          "A safe and beautiful evening activity . The show was from 930-1030 pm . There were families and people everywhere but we felt completely safe as two females . We were close to the fountain as most of the seats were filled so we did get wet . Beautiful fountain with lights and",
          "These fountains are not to be missed - quite amazing. You can look back at Placa d'Espana and up towards Museu Nacional D'Art de Catalunya. Amazing! We sadly only got to see them in the day and early evening, but they were still stunning. We would have enjoyed the night",
          "Best thing to do in Barcelona! The show was amazing and we really enjoyed it. It\u2019s a free show and I personally think it\u2019s a must do here in Barcelona where you pay everything! We got there around 9ish and it was already plenty of people. We found a space on the stairs just by",
          "The fountains were very beautiful but not as good as I thought it would be. We went for our kids to see. There are lots of people watching but that was not a big deal. I just thought that the music should have been louder. We got very close because I thought maybe we were to far",
          "The Magic Fountain at the top of Placa Espanya was a very colourful experience. The fountains were dancing on the beats of various music. The show lasted longer then an hour, but never was boring, on the contrary",
          "This takes place next to the 4 Catalan pillars in the area where Expo 29 was. To get there, go on Metro to Espanya Station and then walk about 5 mins along the Avenguda de la Reina Maria Cristina. There\u2019s lots of standing room and easy to see the fountain. There\u2019s also a seating",

          "After a bit of a (long) walk we arrived at the fountains and it was spectacular to see the \"show\" The lighting is cool and the kids really loved it. Also a very nice area outside the centre of the city",
          "Was really nice to see but so crowded. People everywhere and annoying street vendors trying to sell beer and water and souvenirs.",
          "We attended the fountain show during Barcelona Pride 2019 and it added to the magic we already felt from the night. Beautiful. I would definitely keep my hands on my purse or wallet, though.",

          "We explored the area during the daytime, including the Olympic village behind the fountain but came back just before dark for the water show. The fountains are lit up in color and set to music. Not to be missed We had a great view from the bridge over the street.",
          "We enjoyed the fountain on a Saturday night. Check the schedule. It doesn't light up every night. We got there early (about 45 minutes before it started and there were already lots of people sitting and waiting) and we sat around so we could get a good view and I'm glad we got",
          "Very crowde but if you get there early you can get a good viewing spot. Up on the balcony is as good a spot as any.",
          "Magnificent and colourful - the centre of the city and a place to embrace or simply enjoy the beautiful sounds and take in all the beauty of Barcelona",

          "A free light and music show alongside the water fountains. Easy to get to on public transport. Well worth traveling to see this.",
          "Very nice to visit the Magic Fountain, especially during the weekend night when they have a light show in combination with the fountain water spray. The city view from the fountain top-level area is spectacular.",
          "After a fantastic dinner at La Gastronomica (a nearby eatery) we strolled to the magic Fountain. Because it was early we were able to wander the area in preparation for the evening show. It pays to get there early for a decent view however do not get too close to the smaller",
          "The fountain show happens Friday-Sunday and it is the most amazing fountain show I have seen in my life.",
          "The surrounding area has so many attractions and then you\u00b4re close by to sit and watch the show and music at the fountain. It\u00b4s a safe part of the city and families come out together. Makes you feel like you\u00b4re living the Spanish Life!",
          "Fun, different, and incredibly popular - we didn\u2019t last the full hour, but are still glad we went. There are public loos & drinks/snacks on sale, also plenty of ad-hoc seating to enjoy the show.",

          "Something to do when you visit Barcelona. Free and easy to get to. Definitely recommends for a great evening.",
          "If you only get one visit to Barcelona you must see these fountains. It starts just before dusk. Make sure your camera is charged. Its beautiful colours set to music. The road leading up to the fountain have fountains all the way up. It's free and outstanding.",

Treat yourself to a guided tour with MARIA of webarcelona.com in a small group on an amazing open-air Mercedes luxury minibus \ud83d\ude90. The timing of this tour was impeccable. We were able to",
          "Really enjoyed the fountain show.. gets very busy but you\u2019ll definitely find a spot to see the fountain properly. I believe there\u2019s two shows, one at 9:30pm and the second at 10pm from Wednesday- Saturday. The music quality is pretty poor but the spectacular fountain makes up",

          "We arrived at 9:00 pm, still light out, but the colors in the water were visible. It got better as it became darker. The show repeats, but I am unsure at what intervals. It was super crowded all the way down to the rotary. It\u2019s better from a distance, or on the bridges",
          "It was an amazing show! Full of music, water, colors, an impression. Starts at 9.30 pm. Don't forget your cameras for the memories.",
          "It was really impressing and fascinating. Watching it while sitting on the stairs is recommended. I think the last show is 11pm.",
          "The show of music, light and water was wonderful. A lovely finale to our 5 days in Barcelona. However, we arrived at 9:15 for the 9:30 show and found few seats available. The 9 of us split up to sit at various locations at ground level rather than stand around together."

It's free and utterly spectacular to behold. Great photo opportunity too. A ton of spectators attend, but you can see from many angles amongst the crowd.",

          "The magic fountain show is really fantastic. It is held on Fridays and Saturdays from 20:00 to 21:00. I suggest to go there a little bit earlier since there are always so many people. Or go there a little later around 20:30 as some people \u2026",
          "The light show played around 9-10pm last August.  I'm not sure if it starts at different time or days in other months. The show was very nice as the colored lights and flow of the fountain tried to match to the music, both old and new ones. \u2026",
          "Lovely place and a must visit if you're looking for a place that will give you a beautiful view of the whole of Barcelona. Warning: There are many stairs, and when I was there the escalator want working...\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude12 The good thing was that time \u2026",

          "Beautiful fountain shows! Free - no cost. People gather in huge groups to watch these shows so be sure to get there early to get a good space! I think it lasted around 30 minutes, would definitely recommend!",
          "Nice show. Although sometimes I have the feeling the music doesn't fit the water show.",
          "A visit is worth to try. It\u2019s not just a fountain. Its massive, because you have not only the fountains but also the Palace as background well illuminated. The music is nice and the movement of the water very well synchronized. As a plus, they play Freddy Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9 \u201cBarcelona\u201d  theme.",
          "Unfortunately, I cannot rate this correctly because I did not actually see the fountain in operation. As it was closed forRefurbishment. I hope to make a return to Barcelona one day where I will be able to see it. For now, ignore the \u2026",

          "Fun show that has different types of music. There are people that will be selling toys and alcohol so there is much fun to be had. It's also across from a mall of you need to use the restroom or get food.",
          "Very nice place \nYou can spend a lot of time here.",
          "A beautiful, magical experience. The show is about half an hour long, and set to music. The fountain changes colours, shapes, height, etc to go with the songs. If you stand close, you WILL get splashed - I would recommend arriving early to \u2026",
          "A beautiful and very long show. Definitely worth seeing.",

          "Looks like the fountain is closed for maintenance, however no information was available at the spot or google.. just on a website. So, I would recommend paying an extra attention and looking the working hours on the official page before going. A lot of visitors and tourists were there waiting for nothing \ud83d\ude15",
          "We had a enjoyable time dancing to the music that went with the colour of the lights and display. The fountain and it's lights were mesmerising and beautiful. The view that we got was at the very front but most people say to get there early \u2026",
          "It is definitely pretty with the museum on one side and the view of plaza espanya on the other. The only downside is the fountain was not working when we went. Not sure if it works only during certain hours or days.",
          "What a great way to spend NYE. Only downside being the lack of facilities. No street vendors for food, or alcohol (although a few local entrepreneurs did sell on beer and fizz for a large percentage). Not many toilets either for 80K people, \u2026",
          "Amazing atmosphere. A place to visit in the evenings to get the light and sound show. You climb up to the castle to get a good view of the city but for the show, it will be preferable to be downstairs.",
          "It is the must visit fountain if you are visiting Barcelona, the musical show is held few days per week, check Google maps for the schedule.\n\nIts busy most of the time, that's why its always better to be there 10 mins before the show begins to get a good view from the stairs",
          "This is the best fountain I have seen after being into Vegas and similar. Plan to visit when the light and sound water show is scheduled during touristy times. The below shared pictures are before the Christmas, mid December 2019.",

          "Magic by name and magic by nature as the sun sets over Barcelona you are treated to what could easily be a fireworks display but with water. The colour is vibrant and the atmosphere is lovely.\n\nSome things to note;\n\n1. Go to toilet before \u2026",
          "This place is amazing. You can see colorful dancing fountain. It's only dancing from 9 pm - 10 pm local time. Make sure you come earlier to save the best spot for enjoy the show, and to take a picture or video because it's very crowded here. Be careful of pickpockets around.",
          "Crowded, but I saw they stopped people going to top as there was no space. You should come early to have a better view. Fountain started 5 to 8. I think they should let the fountain run all day long to avoid the crowd. Anyway, if I compare it Dubai one it\u2019s nothing",
          "A spectacular show. Get there early to grab a seat at the steps. Your legs will thank you later as the show is 1 hr long. The music sequence can be improved though.",
          "Very fun! Came in the winter and the shows were a delight. Each medley of songs was ~4-6 minutes, and ranged from Christmassy to classical to Spanish. Good turnout and excellent location.",
          "There is nothing magical about it. Yes the synchronization and the music are good but there stops the story. There are not enough seating arrangements to watch the show and people sit wherever possible. Hawkers and street vendors throng the \u2026",

          "Great place, great experience, great show. The most beautiful place in Barcelona. The show is awesome, the lights are beautiful, the figures are great and the music, oh, the music, there is music for everyone. It doesn't matter if you are \u2026",
          "Amazing! The fountain show was great. I would get there early (we got there 10 minutes before and it was packed) and find a spot at the top of the stairs for the best view. Definitely recommend coming here after dinner for the light show!",
          "I loved it but if you have been to Las Vegas fountain shows you will be like meh.....But I wasn't so...I loved it! They started with the light show and music BARCELONA and then water dances along with music. It was crowded but tolerable.",
          "I have been told, that this will be a great experience. Unfortunately after I came to the fountain, I realized that it was closed and there was no show on that day. So my tip is: Please check the time, before you head there. There are different opening hours during the year.",
          "Pro Tip: Try to get here about 30 minutes before (8:30 PM) to ensure you have a good spot if you are into photo/videography!\n\nI was here tonight (31.10.19) to witness the spectacular musical fountain show with my mum and we thoroughly \u2026",

          "The Greek Amphi Theatre is a hidden treasure from 1929 build by Greeks. Go the the bottom, sit in the seat made for The King and listen to the great sound. Then you know why this form of architecture is used for modern day arenas and stadiums\u2665\ufe0f",
          "It's a cool show, one time seeing it is enough. Do take in account that it's very crowded, especially during the touristic season. So better to be there at least an hour earlier, to be able to get some decent spots with a good visibility.",
          "Chill atmosphere great for family and friends relaxing in the evening but during the day is when it's most magical as the fountain Is definitely going to be on",
          "It was a mystical & magical entertainment at the National arts museum, watching the huge magical fountain. It is a free visual treat to all for 30 minutes on select days of a week. Check for the days of performance before going, as the \u2026",

          "An exciting place! Very beautiful! Would recommend to go earlier if you want to get a good view.",
          "Was there during the day. I guess it\u2018s more interesting when it\u2019s dark",

          "Fountain light show was nice to watch for a couple minutes but overall slightly underwhelming, especially with the music. I thought this would be a must-see for my first time in Barcelona. There were a lot of crowds and I had to constantly be on guard for pickpockets.",
          "Beautiful! Get here early if you want a good view. Also don't go alone if you can help it because it gets very crowded.",
          "Magic. The shouldn't call it Mount Jews, thats offensive to mountains.",
          "Definitely not worth at the time. They are under construction (February 2020) so not worth seeing. But the Olympic park behind is really worth a walk and visit. But the fountains seems to be worth a visit when they are active, probably have to come back once. H\u00e8 h\u00e8... :)",

          "Well worth a visit! Fantastic, had such a brilliant time! Get there early if you want a step to sit on but we just sat on the ground and had beers and snacks. The lights go with the music, I would definitely go and see this again!",
          "Very beautiful and spectacular show.\nWorth to see whenever you're in Barcelona.\nBeautiful music and lights together with fountain makes really good show. I recommend to come an hour before to take a good place because it's super crowded! \u263a",
          "It is one of the spots you should not miss, it is very beautiful, and well accessed transportation wise.\n\nThere are free toallets, also free puclic tap water around.\n\nIt's worth the time to walk there, and hike up to get a good views.\n\nI do recommend this place, if your time allows.",

          "This is a must see when visiting Barcelona.  The light and fountain show is just fun to see.  There was a huge crowd in the middle of September,  but everyone kept a respectable space and wasn't pushy.  There ARE people selling trinkets and drinks but if you say no or ignore them they walk away and don't push the issue.",
          "The fountain looks beautiful - different colors and good music (both old and new songs played). I was here today (13 December) hence got some Christmas songs as well. \ud83d\ude0a\nThe timings are however very unclear as there is nowhere mentioned \u2026",

          "Unfortunately, I couldn't see the Magic fountain because it was Winter. It looks great from the Google photos.",
          "You have to wait beforehand for about an hour if you want a good seat, and the display lasts for around two hours, so do anticipate a long time sitting on the stone steps. There are also a lot of people walking round selling tat, and quite \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing another must see when visiting the city. Gery busy so get there early to bag yourself a good spot. The fountains and buildings are worth visiting during the day also the appreciate their grandeur",
          "The thing is it is free that is why people flock to go here. But walking to this fountain, so many vendors selling. Be very very careful. Nothing to see in the area except for the fountain area. Also it starts exactly at 8pm so useless to be early. Would skip this is you have short time in Barcelona.",
          "The fountain doesn't work during the winter months week days so I wasn't lucky to see it in its glory. It's a nice area of Barcelona and worth seeing it anyway.",
          "Great display of fountains with coloured lights. First different Rock music snippets to go with rhythm of the fountains movement. Then Classical arrangements as the fountains and water rose and fell. Behind the main fountains there are \u2026",
          "This is a beautiful fountain, but you have to get there at the right time if you want to see the fountain in action. Most of the time, the water is turned off. What's the point of a fountain without water?",
          "A wonderful show, the fountains are perfectly synced to the music... An absolutely beautiful end to the day, thoroughly recommended!",
          "The fountain show is absolutely spectacular and I would recommend anyone going. I would advise to go early to ensure you are stood in a good place as it gets very crowded but there are lovely views from all around. Absolutely breathtaking experience and the atmosphere is incredible.",
          "Very pretty! Great view from the old Bullring. We viewed it from afar first, and as we walked closer, realized it was turned off before we got there. Apparently it is turned off somewhere around 9pm to 9:30pm.",
          "The building and sorroundings will leave you in awe apart from that there is nothing much to do. \nAlso I found the guys selling soverneirs at reasonable price compare to other places.",
          "Excellent site to visit in Barcelona. There you will see beautiful eater fountains sincronized with music. I went on a Thursday evening but I think the show goes on in other days of the week also. If you go up to the National Museum of Art of Catalonya you'll find a beautiful of Barcelona.",
          "Cool attraction. The while neighbourhood comes to view it's that good!",
          "Beautiful place to visit and walk up to museum and hike all the way to the Fort on top of the mountain.",
          "Comfortable stairs to walk up to the top of Montju\u00efc, there are elevators in the middle part of the place which makes it easier to reach the top. The waterfeatures are all working at night. Not to miss to see the breathtaking views of Barcelona",
          "Lovely atmosphere with beautiful light, water and music show. The fountain show is a great attraction.",
          "The place is very beautiful but sadly the fountains weren't going when we were there.",
          "Fantastic show! Free and well worth the trip. Its off season and was packed. Can't imagine the summer.",
          "Beautiful place, and fantastic views, be aware that there are no fountains between Jan and March of 2020 (and possibly every year)",
          "An amazing fountain and it's the biggest that i've ever seen! Visit it once in life",
          "This whole area is beautiful! The fountains start on the hill from the Catalan Art Museum and go all the way down to the street. The main fountain has a light show at nite that we missed but I have great photos. One thing we found out was \u2026",
          "Montju\u00efc itself is wonderful, this fountain only confirms it. Try to be here in the evening and witness the spectacular show.",
          "This is a wonderful place. To be honest there's no real words to describe how beautiful this fountain is.\nBeautiful lights and effects with the water.\nIt really was worth the trip and absolutely advise everybody to take the time and go take a look at this show.\nI'm so glad I got to experience this.",
          "Magical experience, must for anyone traveling to Barcelona. Incredible views and the fountain with music is spectacular. Walking distance from the train station. A must see.",
          "The evening light show is an absolute must-see. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to convey the magic of the fountains through words or even photos. Sure, you can see how pretty the water and lights are, but that\u2019s only half the treat.\n\nWhat you really have to \u2026",
          "See open times on the internet ( not Google or trip advisor) it was closed for the period i visited with my son, feb to mars 2020 because of renovation. But becides that is amazing incredible breath taking view!! Just take and look at my pictures.",
          "The place is amazing and the fountain is spectacular. It's one hell of an experience. You feel like clicking pictures again and again.Single picture is not enough. Do read the timings and days when the magic \u26f2 amazes you. Kudos to Barcelona \u2026",
          "A must-see if you ever visit although you have to be there really early to secure a seat! Hundreds of people flock here daily so if you don't mind standing then secure a place on one of the footbridges that cross the road oppsite where you can get some great views at a distance.",
          "Really nice evening watching the fountains. Got there approx 45mins before the show start so was able to sit on the ledge by the fountains beforehand, show lasted just over an hour and was a great experience to see.\n\nLuckily Barcelona was \u2026",
          "This fountain is absolutely beautiful. It has different jets which create patterns and effects along with lights that make the water appear to be different colours. It is very crowded during the show and it is wise to figure out ahead of \u2026",
          "We got nice places right in front of the fountain although we came quite late. The opening hours change based on the sunset. The show is very nice and should be a stop on every trip to Barcelona.",
          "Amazing  fountain! Some days in the afternoon around 21:00 there is a show with music and the fountain changes many colors. Worth visiting!!",
          "It could be spectacular but unfortunately the fountain was turned off in January and February.",
          "Very beautiful fountains but the place is often full of people. In that case you have to be on place early enough to pick up a good place and could be able to hear the music and watch the show. I think that every show is 20 minutes long and start a new one in every 30 minute with 10 minutes break between each other.",
          "It was crowded but so worth it. The light and music show was incredible. The kids loved it. It was their favorite part of the trip.",
          "Fountains and music we're cool but not on the \"must see\" list for our group. I'm glad we went but I wouldn't make it a huge priority of you have something else fun to do. The crowd was not crazy when we went (full but not crazy) on a Thursday night in October. We stayed about 30 minutes then moved on.",
          "It's a mandatory stop in Barcelona. The show is beautiful. It usually gets very full so go before it starts to find a good spot.",
          "Absolutely dazzling display, the waterfall dances for around an hour to musical soundtrack with coloured lighting, we were there on Saturday night I think it only displays at weekends from 9 til 10pm, there was a crowd of a few thousand \u2026",
          "A relax place to visit with a nice view of the city. After the visit, you could walk up the hill to see the Olympic stadium.",
          "This looks amazing of you can get trip see it.\n\nWe were passing by it on a weekend and the place was SO packed that it was hard to get from one end to the other walking.\n\nTo be honest I think that as it is quite a well known place to visit \u2026",
          "This is a magic place located in Barcelona ..a fantastic show goes on where the lights and water can dance along with the music ..fabulous!!",
          "Absolutely stunning atmosphere with thousands of people gathered around in anticipation and yes start was brilliant with massive water emissions. But magic wore off after 10 minutes when they started playing touristy pop songs and water \u2026",
          "Absolutely lovely!\nCheck the times on the official websites.\nWe have seen the show at the begining of March, on Friday evening at 8.30.. It took 30min..and was spectaculat.. The whole place looks magical.. But if you wish to take pics of \u2026",
          "26/12 dec It was  a holiday. I just got a few pictures. Yeah It was a wonderful view",
          "This has beautiful displays of light and water, there is a bar with fairly expensive food at the top, but that's to be expected for such an attraction.\n\nWe were also treated to some of the best breakdancers I'd ever seen as a prelude to the \u2026",
          "Water display to long. (One hour) not impressed. The road leading to it is impressive when it is lit up and fountains running.",
          "Very beautiful but not very well synchronised with the music.",
          "Disappointing to say the least. There is no synchronisation between the music and the movements of the water. The selected music is hardly inspiring, the exception being a few excerpts of Davie Bowie and Prince. Not waste too much time there.",
          "One of my very nice experience in Barcelona is seeing this Font Magica. With the different light effects, the water changes its color and dances to the sound of music. Really magical",
          "Architecture, history, water features. New meets old when there is a museum of art one side of the street and the 1992 Olympic Games Stadium on the other side.\nAwesome experience.",
          "It is trully amazing!!! Can view the musical fountain every other day from 8pm and it is worth it!!!! Loads of people visiting. The colours are spectacular and the music fits. Its a trully amazing and magic fountain",
          "Highly recommend seeing the show. It's free to watch and absolutely gorgeous at night. Depending on which season you're there, the show will start at different times- make sure to check the website. Went in early September and the show was \u2026",
          "First night after winter maintenance and it was great! This is a treat for anyone visiting Barcelona.",
          "Lovely place, If you visit barcelona definetly go here.",
          "Amazing place. It excellent place to seat and relax. To make a friend with the locals, talk, hang out or just people watching. Simply Beautiful .",
          "It has a breathtaking view. The music and the city made me relaxed. You can either take the stairs or escalators to the top.",
          "La Fuente de Montjuic is simply the best. One never gets tired of it. Love it",
          "The Font M\u00e0gica is an absolute must-see in Barcelona.\nIt is perfect to visit before enjoying the night life of Barcelona.\nAt the Font M\u00e0gica are a enormous amount of people, so make sure to go there earlier, or try to catch a good place.\nI \u2026",
          "Most imposant place. Romantic. A lot of good music. A must see",
          "The fountain and place were so beautiful. The water fountain is something you can't miss. It was a whole SHOW",
          "So incredibly busy. Almost not worth going. But very cool fountain. Like a firework display. Fountains all down the street and looked really beautiful",
          "Be aware on windy days because you'll get absolutely wet \ud83d\ude05 It's crowded but nice.",
          "Must have for anyone who visits Barcelona. The whole show is amazing, the synchronization of the fountain and the music is great. Plus you are in one of the best places in Barcelona with a nice looking palace at the top. Don't miss it out if you're in Barcelona.",
          "Huge and beautiful place, rounded by tourists and local people all day long.\nThe fountain Montjuic it\u2019s a show a part. Be aware it only takes place on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 8:00 pm \u2013 9:00 pm. \n\nMake sure to arrive early, because this square is always packed of people!",
          "A total highlight of Barcelona for me. The crowds were considerable but you could still see the fountains and the show was spectacular.\nThe music could have been louder, above the noise of the water and the people it was quite hard to make \u2026",
          "Amazing free display that played after 9pm on the Friday we were there in October but check the web for more details, the area around the fountains was very busy so we stayed back and watched the hypnotic colours and enjoyed the music from a distance , well recommended.",
          "Disappointed as it wasn\u2019t on when we arrived. Not sure if it was because it was off peak or what. But a wasted journey to be honest. The area was nice tho, hence the 3 stars",
          "What a fantastic light show with music. A brilliant evening experience.",
          "The fountain light show was absolutely amazing! And the views from around the fountain are beautiful\ud83d\ude0d absolutely loved it! Highly recommend and will be back\u2661",
          "The fountain is in maintenance until 4th March. You only realise once you get there.",
          "Very nice Place to visit. I suggest spend one afternoon there!",
          "Amazing place! Unforgettable experience! Beautiful palace and marvellous fountain that enchants you with its beauty!\nSituated right in the heart of Barcelona in the famous square - Plaza De Barcelona. Mui bonito))\nMust visit!\nEnjoy!",
          "Magical! You have to go and find out the schedule of the shows, it is gorgeous",
          "Really nice show. It started around 9:15 pm and lasted about an hour, or at least that\u2019s how long I stayed. The fountain displays many colors and music. A beautiful show indeed. If you do not get a sit don\u2019t worry as you\u2019ll end up standing \u2026",
          "A beautiful show take place 3 days per ween in winter from 8 to 9 PM.\nYou can stay 100 meters away from the fountains to have a better view and avoid the crowd.",
          "It's free and beautiful. It's a lovely 'thank you' gift, to all the tourists that come to visit Barcelona. Make sure you stand right near the fountain so you can hear the music. After the spectacle go and have a little drink nearby. A Lovely gift from Barcelona.",
          "Amazing place. Beautiful at night to watch the fountain connect with the music. There is also a lot of tourists here and all seem to be amazed. It is also good that you can go up the stairs to get a better view of everything considering \u2026",
          "Though the acrobatics was good.. Wasn\u2019t much thrilled as the music could have been better..",
          "Magical music fountain.\n\nThe sound effects aren\u2019t loud enough but otherwise it\u2019s a must go! Make sure you arrive 30 minutes before and don\u2019t sit too close/on the rail of the stairs or you\u2019ll get wet!!",
          "Tons of fun to see the light and water show at night. You could come after the show starts, since it is quite long and find a good viewing place after people start trickling off. I showed up an hour early for a seat in the stairs, but again people left pretty quick and there were open places to sit.",
          "A magic place full of history. Amazing light show in summertime.",
          "Was expecting more. Just water playing, but not on music as one would expect. A lot of people going so consider going 30 min before for a good place to see. Also, don't stand right near the fountain as the wind blows the water and you could get wet",
          "The fountain lives up to its name leaving you mesmerised by its beauty and splendor.",
          "Wednesday to Sunday from 9:30pm (in July). Spectacular to watch and listen to. A good mix of music too (Pop and classical). Carries on beyond the hour too. Just watch the pickpockets, with your attention on the fountains, it's not on your bags and pockets so beware, especially leaving the event.",
          "The magic fountain was incredible. Our only complaint was that the music could have been louder. The spray from the show was very refreshing. And I would recommend to walk around the back to the steps to get the best view.",
          "Very nice visual and sound display. The problem is that it will be too overcrowded with people. Getting there and back is difficult because of all the street merchants occupying half the sidewalk with their wares (bags, shoes, magnets). \u2026",
          "I was here in July 2019 and I must say, that I never saw more magical fountain before... In the midnight, the area changes into a magical, colourful place with great music. The show was long for 1 hour. It might seem a little bit longer, \u2026",
          "amazing fountain light show, a must visit if you're in the area, very romantic and really sets the mood for a great date.\nit's right on the foothills of muntjuic so if you spend you day at the mountain the fountain is a great end.",
          "The fountain is a site to see at night. Wonderful experience. Lighted musical fountains, dancing people, amazing view.",
          "It gives a good view of the city.. The fountain however wasn't functional in the day time.",
          "Beautiful fountain, absolutely wort seeing on a visit to Barcelona. Be there at least 30 minutes before the show starts, it will be crowded. Can not give 5 stars, since the music is not synced with the fountain show.",
          "Got there at 9:15 for the 9:30 showing and it was so busy (even though it was raining). Quite literally 1000s of people there. If you want to be able to get a good viewing, I'd recommend going at least 30 mins before it starts. Aside from \u2026",
          "Not so magical after all.\nIf you expect classical music and synchronization with water splashes, spend your time elsewhere. It's just mostly modern pop music and more or less the same color/patterns of the fountain. Nice, but not the first \u2026",
          "Way prettier than expected. I'd seen fountain shows, but the scale and lighting  were like nothing before. Definitely worth the trip at night to see the show. Make sure to check the website if you want a specific choreography and for the \u2026",
          "Amazing views of Barcelona and a nice place to just chill, especially in a somewhat sunny afternoon!",
          "It's a must in Barcelona! Check the hours for when you're visiting and get ready for an amazing evening. Get some drinks, go a bit early and head to the top to get the full view. Or sit next to the fountain. Whatever you decide you'll be mesmerised. And it's free. And a great date night as well! What more do you want?",
          "Best to come a little earlier to get better views. There are also some vendors roaming around to sell beer and other drinks.",
          "Beautiful place. Huge crowd. Nice fountain with music. Enjoyed on a Saturday Evening.",
          "The magic fountain show was spectacular to the music in New Years Eve. So worth going to watch.",
          "Really good show start around 9pm till 10 pm .\nMusic and fun \nVery crowded you need to go early to get a nice spot .",
          "Spectacular place. Well worth visiting",
          "Good for about 30 mins but after that can be a little repeative. Be prepared to get wet and squished through.",
          "Awesome place and view ! It's a must on your to do list!",
          "Beautiful show. Well Worth it to spending time to watch",
          "Awesome views, but unfortunately the fountain was closed for Renos when I arrived in January. However the climb up to the viewing area gave us a 180\u00b0 view of Barcelona (you can also see la sagrada familia), so it's worth the visit!",
          "Good place better visit afternoon-night, beware the pick pockets...",
          "One of the must visit place in Barcelona city.\nIts open from 8 to 9 pm. And best part is its free of cost",
          "Free of charge and good for the entire family with easy access by metro, bus and car. I liked it more when they played classic music only, as it flows better with the light and water show, in my opinion. In any case, it is a great attraction and worth seeing it!\nBe aware of pickpockets since it is a very popular attraction!",
          "Amazing spectacle! We stayed for both spectacles, as it was somehow hipnotizing and simply beautiful. Just be careful of your belongings, especially if you are standing closer to the fountains. My advice : start from the distance, as it is \u2026",
          "No magic fountain show last time we went here which was early march but view was spectacular. Don't worry about climbing, there's escalators.",
          "Enjoyed the area. Was there for new years and it was a great sight.",
          "We loved the evening water spectacle, hundreds of tourists everywhere but if you go early enough you can get a good spot on the stairs in front of the fountain. When Barcellona by freddy mercury takes off, magic happens, the water splash, the lighting and the music is a must see while in the city",
          "Must see when in Barcelona... Any time of year!  A beautiful fountain display complete with music, and it's free.",
          "The view is beautiful. There are more famous places around so you should plan to stay more time over there :)",
          "Nice fountain show, but soooo full!! A few years ago there was a fraction of the people. Show is free",
          "It's a nice water show, but there's by no means anything extraordinary about it. You can't hear the music because the people there make too much noise. Unless you arrive at least an hour before the show begins, you won't be able to get too \u2026",
          "Every Friday to Sunday 8:00 and 8:30 pm will work perform the water show, very lively and joyful",
          "Amaizing place. I visited with my husband for the 2nd time and we'll not stop there. Missing Barcelona already. See you soon.",
          "You have good panorama to Plaza Espanya. See the night show.",
          "Fountain dance was very nice to see. It was forst time for me to see fountain dance particularly in Barcelona ehich is my favourite city.",
          "If you are in Barcelona is a must. Yu need to check when it opens , in winter is closed. Nowadays are better music fountains I'm the world. But of you haven't seen one before you will like it. Also the landscape is beautiful.",
          "Be very careful. Even though the show is nice, it works anoly certain days and for certain time.",
          "A great place! Take your time to visit this place, the gardens are very big.",
          "Totally kitch, but a fun and free night out. Well worth checking out if you're in Barcelona. Make sure you go up the escalator to get to the higher level by the 4 columns for the best views.",
          "It is a really beautiful place. Really good lighting effects.",
          "So special - the fireworks and fountain display were amazing!",
          "This was absolutely beautiful, and well worth it! The show lasted from 21:30-22:30. We arrived at around 21:00 and the place was so busy, we couldn't get a seat. So make sure to arrive really early to get a seat. We stood the whole time and still got a great view. It was amazing.",
          "If you\u2019re looking for something to do after sunset, this is a free and fun experience. Be sure to check the website to ensure you go on the correct day/time, as it changes occasionally.\n\nThis area gets packed with people, so be sure to \u2026",
          "It has a great view and it's a place where you can there and enjoy your time",
          "Nice to walk around at night. The fountain is kind of sinchronised with the music and lights.",
          "View of this place  is just Awesome,  one must visit this place once in a life \u2764",
          "A spectacular and magical garden. The show started at 20:50 and finished at 22:00.\nIt's better to be there at least one hour before the start of the show.",
          "Perfect experience. The only perfect experience that is not charged in Barcelona. Hahahahaha. You can see the show in the evening. It lasts an hour and the Palace behind is just... A dreamy piece of art.",
          "Amazing. There are a plenty of people, but it is a must-see experience. It is very important that you look ahead to the schedule, because the fountain doesn't make this show always. We were in the evening. Then we went up to the castle, wich is now a museum. We were able to go in for free. Beautiful building, well worth a look.",
          "Nice view, music and water show. Better to come 15-20 min. in advance and stay on the bridge or stairs. Do not come too close, but if you are too far - you whould not hear the music (it could be much louder btw)",
          "Nice fountain and light display.\nGet there early, it gets very busy",
          "Unfortunally was not functionaly in that period, 23 feb.",
          "The fountains are an exceptional experience. It is recommended to bring small children.",
          "Lovely fountain that dances to music twice in the evening. A wonderful 30 min show. If you get close you\u2019ll be able to hear the music but if you are sitting on the steps you may be able to see the show a little better. Note: watch for pick \u2026",
          "One of my very nice experience in Barcelona is seeing this Font Magica. With the different light effects, the water changes its color and dances to the sound of music. Really magical",
          "Perfect, simply perfect. Great show of lights, music and water at night.",
          "Gorgeous! If you go to watch the fountain show, go EARLY! It\u2019s packed like 2 hours before, but then you see the show and understand why, it\u2019s awesome! Perfect for instagrammers to get that perfect picture \ud83d\ude09",
          "The fountain makes a very impressive show! Prepare to stand there for 1-2 hours as leaving early might mean pushing through waves of people. If you arrive ~45 minutes early, you might get a seat on the stairs. This will of course make \u2026",
          "The foundation is under renovation unfortunately, but the passage up to the museum is fantastic",
          "Awesome experience. The font works fine with the lights and music combined, there are several spots to watch the show around the square, in front of the castle and all over around. You must pay attention to your belongings while observing the show.",
          "Great place but make sure you go on day when the show is on.. Winter time its only Thursday Friday and Saturday",
          "Spectacular! I went at the christmas event with the lights and the music. The fountain was magical!",
          "Wow, Just wow. Dance of water with light and music. It is good to come even an hour earlier to find right place to watch the show. It is worthy to wait.",
          "This free light and water fountain display is truly magical. Well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing piece of architecture. Visitors can use escalator both ways up and down, although wheelchair access could be problematic. No entrance fee to the park. The views are perfect. Not many refreshment stands, water is overpriced, bring your own. Overall good experience.",
          "Pretty disappointing. Huge turn out (probably over a thousand people) but the music was hardly audible from anywhere (we sat at the main stairs and ended up walking around the fountain before it finished). The water goes up super high and \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to spend some time and enjoy the view. When I got there, the fountain was dead but still nice.",
          "Probably the best public place in Barcelona. Amazing sightseeing. At the end of the day gets kinda cold.",
          "Worthy of a visit, don't miss the classic modernist icon the Barcelona Pavilion",
          "This free evening animated musical fountain show is a must see during any visit to Barcelona! It's simply magical... Since the site is open to the public, plan to arrive a little early so you can get a decent view because the crowds build \u2026",
          "Magical fountains indeed. A full hour of wonder.\nRecommended to come at least 45 min before the show if you want to get a decent seating place with good view of the show.\nLots of guys performing with dancing, fire shows and other types of \u2026",
          "Very good view of the city and harbour and the evening water fountain show.",
          "Great place to visit. Make sure you see the schedule of the water fountain show",
          "Beautiful display! Be sure to stand away from the side fountains on the steps of the museum as to not get wet! Also bring a jacket as it can get cool even on those warmer June nights. Come early (60-90) minutes for the best spots on the steps!",
          "A great place to visit if you are in Barcelona. When I went you couldn't hear the background music for the light show due to a concert in the background (La Merc\u00e9) but it was still amazing. Make sure you check when the light show is so you know what nights and times it happens.",
          "Very good colourful musical fountains",
          "Loved it! Spectacular show and super worth going! Arrive a bit earlier to get a good spot because it gets completely full of people everywhere! Check showtimes on google but for summer the shows are at 9:30PM and I guess also at 10PM.",
          "Wow wow and wow. A free display that is truly wonderful. Just wish the sound was better, but otherwise this is a must for any traveller to Barcelona.",
          "You can't hear nothing.. the volume of the music is so low and there are cars and bus passing in the near road.. \nThe fountain is amazing with a lot of potential.. but please at least sync the water with the music..",
          "A must visit attraction which plays on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 8pm to 9pm. Thumbs Up!",
          "Spent a beautiful afternoon there. Enjoyed the view of fountain and mountain skyline.",
          "Beautifull part of Barcelona. Especially from spring to autumn with the magic fountains.",
          "Night light show fountain with water. It was not very impressive although great for kids and families. Couple of American songs on the show list but mostly old songs.",
          "How can anyone not enjoy this event. Beautiful. Free as well which is a great bonus. Nice relaxing atmosphere. So glad we made the effort to visit. Recommended*****",
          "Amazing musical fountain. It happens at Espanya and is free of cost. It usually takes place for an hour. Make sure to check if the show happens on the given day since it happens 3-4 days a week.",
          "When the show starts it's magical! Worth every second of your time",
          "Most beautiful place I've been to in Barcelona! Especially when the fountains start dancing, all tourists gathering around it with their phones and music singing... A summer sunset in this place is just the most romantic urban one you can get! It would be much better though if there was less people...",
          "Great view from the 4 pillars at the foot of the art gallery steps. Still managed to get a bit wet from the spray! :-)",
          "Great place :) just check on the internet the day and time for the show :)",
          "This is a fantastic free space to visit. The fountain itself is great if viewing the show, otherwise just going for the view at the top of the stairs is great. There is some escalators but you do need to climb some steps. Well worth it for the view. And seeing the pillars etc on the way",
          "Stunning light show with water and music. It is really busy in certain locations however you can find a lot of seating. Some with amazing views. \n\nThe show is only at certain times so make sure to come early so you are not disappointed. Be \u2026",
          "Beautiful fountain that moves to music. I'm not sure what the schedule is to see the fountain in motion, but if you catch it at the right time, it's a beautiful sight. Lots of people around enjoying the show with lots of viewing areas to stand and enjoy.",
          "Great experience. Make not of the visiting times to experience the magic",
          "Amazing relaxing place with great view and music I love if you are in Barcelona make sure to visit this place, I'm living here since one year and from time to time I like to go there and chill watching it. \nImportant: \nWhen you are there \u2026",
          "Very pretty display, a unique touch for the city. Gets extremely busy to start but dies down around half way through the display. Started sitting further away and decided to move closer, ended up with a front row view. Got very wet! Got a touch boring though.",
          "Very beautiful to watch but unless you're next to the fountain you cannot hear the music accompaniment. And large crowds who will watch it mostly through their phone which they will happily hold in front of your view.",
          "A must see tourist destination! Situated below the magnificent Palau Nacional, it sprays 700 gallons of water per second. If one plans properly, shouldn't miss the night musical show.",
          "Ahhh its must visit place in Bcn its free entry and you can enjoy the briliant atmosphere",
          "Got there at about 9.30pm on a Sunday evening. Was aware that there will not be the musical fountain show but the whole fountain was off!!! What a disappointment. Online site did not indicate total fountain turned off. I think it only operates on different times on different seasons of the year.\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24",
          "This is another must see place. Beautiful show with music, lights, and the water fountain. The museum at the background is an amazing piece of architecture.",
          "Amazing experience. A must see in the beautiful city of Barcelona.",
          "Magical water display light by colours accompanied by popular music. We went on a Thursday evening, you need to check which nights the display is taking place",
          "Water fountain show with colors and different music. It gets crowded about 45 mins prior to the actual start of the show so I\u2019d recommend if you wanna get good seats to arrive early and find a good spot to watch. We personally sat on the \u2026",
          "Another must do in Barcelona. Make sure you check online of the tome shows before you get there . it gets pretty crowded. It is really really beautiful once the fountains gets mixed up with the lights. My only suggestion would be if they \u2026",
          "It\u2019s definitely magical! It gets very crowded but there there early and you can get a good view from the steps or the bridge. It\u2019s a must to do in the evening. It\u2019s a shot walk from bus and metro stop but definitely so worth it!",
          "Nice show, but if you're short on time, skip it. Better things to see in Barca",
          "Nightly show with various music.  This is family friendly with very large crowds. Get to the early show with young kids. \nExpect lots of unlicensed vendors along the streets near by. No admittance fee.",
          "We sat here for the evening and experienced a fantastic water/light show. So enjoyable.",
          "Wonderful environment! However awful annoying people selling things allover. I really had to tell them to stop asking me if I want to buy selfie sticks!",
          "Like many attractions in Barcelona, Font Magica is not coping well with growth and popularity. As a local it used to be my favourite place in the city. Now the place gets too crowded to be enjoyable with people sitting anywhere in a very \u2026",
          "The show starts at 9 pm. Make sure you get there prior to that in order to secure a seat as there will be alot of people. Also make sure you are not sitting by a water outlet as the fountain is vast. There are drinks being sold by vendors \u2026",
          "Spectacular display..and free....amazing hour long show. Well worth a visit",
          "Only the most magic place you can visit! It's romantic, fun and inspiring especially for photographs. But the magic the music adds.. It's unlike anything you've experienced!! \ud83d\ude0d It's better to get there by the sunset.. And watch this \u2026",
          "Impressive fountain. Helpful vendor selling selfie sticks. \ud83e\udd23",
          "The show was quite amazing and entertaining and lasted for a long time. Coordination with music could have been done better. Better try to get there half an hour in advance",
          "I love visiting this place again and again its just beautiful.",
          "Gorgeous at night. Check schedule for showtimes",
          "The Magic Fountain of Montju\u00efc was constructed for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. I found it particularly pretty, but it is a pity that the authorities shut it down almost every day just after dark.",
          "Come in December, there is a fountain at 8pm on Sunday, Saturday, Sunday.  You need to find a good place in advance because there are many people.",
          "Magestic view of placa espa\u00f1a with magic fountain",
          "Really beautiful!! Color change with music for around an hour, every week-end. There is not an entrance ticket.",
          "It's nice there and it look beautiful.",
          "Amazing experience! Very very crowded people are mostly standing near escalator so come closer for better views and more space. You will be moiat from the action.",
          "Great show! Come half hour before the show to see get the best place to watch the show",
          "It was closed and nothing about working times suggested so it was a waste of time on my last night in Barcelona",
          "Beautiful fountain in front of the National Museum of Art of Catalu\u00f1a. Many nice places to sit and enjoy the views of the whole city. The main fountain is at ground level but the museum is up on a hill so be prepared with some water after walking up :)",
          "Spectacular water fountains, probably best viewed from the footbridges over the road.\nGet too close and it's hard to see the scale and on a windy day you may get wet. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A awesome night the fountain and fireworks off the scale highly recommended",
          "Beautiful show at the fountain of water dancing to music.  Free as well.",
          "It's a spectacular fountain in front of beautiful MNAC building, it's one of the most amazing place to visit in Barcelona. Near a metro station. Well worth a visit. Recommended.",
          "Fantastic and beautiful spectacle! The water changed colours and height over a period of an hour similar to a fireworks display!\n\nThe journey to the Fountain Magic Show was easy and the train wasn't very full. The area was within several \u2026",
          "Wonderful place to visit and so pretty fountains and wonderful views",
          "Awesome place, especially at night \u2764\ufe0f",
          "A magical place, really worth taking your children during festive or holiday seasons with all the light shows they put up around Font Magica de Montjuic in Placa Espanya. Also popular for musical events and at the doorstep of the national \u2026",
          "Amazing fountains, just make sure you are up wind or prepare to get wet",
          "Awesome place during the day and austanding on the evening \ud83d\udc4f",
          "We came upon this venue totally by accident and what a find.  The fountains were amazing and not what we expected.  We came in via the back and were totally surprised by what we found at the front.  The view from the top of the fountains were wonderful.  Worth a visit.",
          "Lovely place with changing lights howeve, it was too much rush due to rain for us.",
          "Beautiful! It was a great show, lots of interesting lighting and good music to go along with it. Quite crowded but still enough room to move around. The area around is also quite pretty with many mini fountains/water features leading up to it. Well worth a watch",
          "I love this fountain show and it is amazing that every evening you can see the whole hill packed with people to experience the show. This is definitely better to do in summer time but even when it's slightly chillier, it's still worth it.",
          "This place is closed every Monday and Tuesday. Show start around 9:30, if I am not mistaken, and last 30-40 min. I am not sure what country is trying to save - water or electricity  - what seems silly, this fact makes tourists quite \u2026",
          "This place provided a spectacular show with the fountain. The music set to the light show gave you a feeling of a story being told, just like an opera. This is a must see for anyone visiting Barcelona. The shows are from 2100 to 2200 \u2026",
          "The view through the teleferic is just amazing.",
          "We got in Barcelona on a Saturday afternoon and since the magic fountain show is only on weekends (Thursday - Saturday), we headed over the same evening with a toddler in tow! Needless to say we all had an amazing time! It was an brilliant \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit if you\u2019re in Barcelona.  Lovely architecture and excellent view once you get to the top. If you like to take photos for Instagram you will have a wide selection to choose from",
          "Great place to Visit in evening time, awesome musical fountain, really wow",
          "Beautiful to see, it is however very crowded so I recommend to watch it from a bit of a distance. You can still see it pretty good from the staircases or the bridge.",
          "A nice evening event to close your trip to Barcelona, beautiful location and a colorful performance. However, be aware that the place will get very crowded fast and people will start to come there almost an hour before the event starts. Also, don't stay too close to the fountain or you will easely get fully wet \ud83d\ude05",
          "Definately worth seeing, just keep in mind that hundreds of people will have the same idea, so get there 15 minutes earlier for best spots..",
          "Excellent spot.... Must visit to get a perspective of Barca",
          "Brilliant show. Lots of people. Pays to get there early for a good spot.",
          "The show is good, but the music is not loud nor clear enough. It used to be much better. So the songs shoud finally be changed",
          "Very cool and unique spot. I would recommend getting a seat on the steps so you can get the best view. Also, make sure to check the schedule because the shows are for only an hour or two at night so be sure to get there a little early if you want to get a good spot.",
          "The show is nice\nIn this time of the year at 20",
          "Amazing place to hangout and take photos. The sound system of the dancing fountain was very poor",
          "just go there on in the weekend, beautufull fauntain, music location.",
          "Perfect place for a romant date \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95",
          "A little bit overrated, but it's ok to see it once (in a lifetime or each once in a while if you actually live in Barcelona).",
          "Loved spending time here. Nice views",
          "Really stunning fountain/light show! Make sure to be there early (I recommend to sit on one of the walls, higher up the better) because the place gets pretty crowded",
          "Many concert happens here at night and literally half of the city is here. We just happen to be in one of them at 11 PM and it was amazing. Must visit.",
          "Too many people an the fountain is on for a little while but if it's on when you get there you can take some awesome shots",
          "Very nice place to have a walk and enjoy an afternoon. There are many things around, so you can spend hours in that area!\nIn the evening (9pm and 9:30pm, I think), there's a show of lights and music in the fountain.\n\nOnly two negative \u2026",
          "Nice fountain show. Starts at around 9 PM. At the main square of Bacelona. Shopping centers and Metro station at walking distance (2-5 min max). Very touristy. All in all nice place to hangout in evening.",
          "Spectacular scenery, amazing show, which lasts about half an hour, then we have different theme. Worth to see if you in Barcelona. Free access. I would recommend sit on stairs or bring own chair.",
          "Amazing sound, water and light experience. One of the best night events in Barcelona.",
          "Amazing experience. Huge crowd gathers to see the musical dance fountain. You can see guys serving beer, juice ans water.",
          "A great experience!!!!the fountain show with the songs the water and lights effects are a life experience.the palace view is stunning and though being overcrowded during the show everything is pleasant.be aware of pick pockets.",
          "Beautiful place, magical place. All you people that are visiting Barcelona this place is really Magical.",
          "Based on the reviews, we thought this was a must-see experience in Barcelona.  We arrived about an hour before the show and had a hard time finding a place to sit.  It gets very crowded, and street vendors and pickpockets run rampant \u2026",
          "That\u2019s not actually an attraction at all. Overcrowded square which is desiring to observe something magnificent. As the result it was just fountains that is blowing in different colors and with loud music. Nothing special at all. The music \u2026",
          "Disappointed because it doesn't work 7 days a week. Don't know about summer time.",
          "Brilliant. The fountain dances to the music in a brilliant display of changing colours. My second visit (two years apart) and enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Easy to get to using the metro if staying anywhere in Barcelona.",
          "Cool in the daytime but supposedly the light show in the evening is amazing.",
          "The fountains at the Museum of Art evoke the feeling of entering a fairytale palace. At night time the combination of light and water makes for a memorable spectical. This experience will not disappoint and I strongly encourage you pay this part of Barcelona a visit.",
          "Such a cool experience! We arrived at 8:15ish, which was way too earlier in my opinion, but we were able to secure some wonderful spots for the show. The show was fantastic and we loved that we even recognized some popular songs. I highly recommend this experience.",
          "It's FREE! Amazing show, worth getting there 30 mins before it starts to find a seat preferably on the steps higher up looking down. The days it's in change between summer and winter so best check. Breath taking display.",
          "A big musical fountain which goes on forever... So no worries if u go late... The show is for 60 mins",
          "If you\u2019re ever in Barcelona you have to visit this place! \nWent there tonight 4th Oct 2019, 250 year jazz anniversary, the place was packed like the new year events.\nIt was amazing, the fountain show was awesome reminded me of the Dubai fountains but of course in much much much smaller scare just a tiny one hahaha!",
          "Because fountain doesnt work all the year. It's such a waste of time to come here and dont see this show.",
          "Absolutely beautiful but wayyyy over crowded. Go early if you want a good spot.",
          "Another a must visit in Barcelona... Definitely a relaxing place overlooking Barcelona...",
          "We unfortunately visited during the day and were not able to experience the lights but the fountains and the grounds of the museum are very beautiful. However, it would be nice if the upkeep was a bit better and the norms on littering were better enforced in reference to the garbage that visitors produce.",
          "There was light, there was water. Somewhere there there was music but we could hardly hear it even though we were standing a few metres from the fountain. I've seen an amazing water fountain show in Turkey where the fountain was actually dancing to the music, there was fire in the water and it was amazing. In a word - not impressed.",
          "Great show. Consider that maybe you'll get a little bit wet",
          "It is a music based water fountain. For some reason, I didn't enjoy my time there . It was crazy crowded and I was just waiting for it to get over so that I could convince my wife to leave.  \ud83d\ude1d",
          "Definitely a must see if you are in Barcelona! The Magic Fountains come alive in all colors and shapes, dancing to music. See the fact that it\u2019s commercial music is something I don\u2019t like, but that\u2019s my own personal opinion. \nEven though \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a magical place and you get a beautiful view of Barcelona",
          "Ok, an illuminated fountain dancing to music could very easily be cheesy, but the Font Magica pulls it off magnificently!\n\nAnd it's free to attend. What more do I need to say? Just go.",
          "Very beautiful water fountain in front  the National Museum of Modern Art  of Catalunya. \nBe sure to  have all scheduled time of the fountain show",
          "Don't miss it. Even if it is crowded there is planty of room for you to enjoy. The view from the highest terrace is the best. If you are thirsty there are always some people selling bear, water..",
          "Dancing fountains with music and fireworks! Best feeling ever!",
          "I was absolutely mesmerized by the beauty of the show from the start! It looked like pure magic at times. Then popular songs started playing so I was dancing (a bit, be mindful of the crowd) and singing along while watching this grand \u2026",
          "A lovely area, not too busy in the late afternoon to come look around and and take photos but note that the fountains turn off at 6pm! There are escalators which take you up to the top. The light show is excellent too and so worth seeing. Make sure to come early (probably about 30 mins beforehand) to get a spot on the steps.",
          "Really great show and totally for free. It's better to come at least 40min before start and find a place to sit on the stairs. You can have the best view from there. Standing right in front of the fountain makes nonsense as you will not see \u2026",
          "One of the best place in the world what you should be visit... Beautiful view... \nIf you wanted to book the best visibility location, you should be arrive 1hour before the  show.",
          "Fountain was shutdown + Beautiful + Check it at day and night",
          "Amazing show, get yourself some a good spot and enjoy colourful fountain dancing to some classic music, that's what they played at the time. Place was absolutely rammed but even though we were late about 10 minutes some good spots could be found.",
          "The fountain show is nice, but it is not in sync to the music.",
          "It\u2019s amazing place and show. It\u2019s working from Wednesday 9:30 pm. \n\nWould recommend to go close to hear the music properly.",
          "Beautiful and it\u2019s free! Perfect for a romantic night out.",
          "Great music and water spectacle. Amazing views from Barcelona",
          "Nice Fontana! Most beautiful in Europe!",
          "Awesome! I would still add some modern soundtracks to their repertoire",
          "Amazing show... Must see.. Relaxing evening.",
          "It was beautiful the first time I was there for like 4-5 years ago, but this time it wasn't turned on so it wasn't exiting at all.",
          "A must visit place in Barcelona. Mostly in the evening for the fountains show bu at any time in day it is trully BREATHTAKING. One can think it looks like Versailles but it is way younger and more modern.",
          "It was fantastic for about 5 minutes, then you remember it's cold and windy",
          "A truly magical experience if on holiday! The fountains leading up to the main fountain are beautiful and then you have the cascading waterfalls beyond that. Really worth visiting! Check times before  as I believe it's only Friday and Saturday at 9pm",
          "A family-friendly free attraction and a must see visit in Barcelona. Very nice and refreshing in the summer nights, although the place is very crowded and the music is maybe too low in volume and quite badly chosen. .\nBeware of pickpockets and also of men selling illegal stuff.",
          "the place to be in the evening. Always check the summer/winter timetable variation. Come at least 1hour - 30mins in advance to catch a good place om the stairs or around the fountain.",
          "The fountains are beautiful. In the winter, the show stats earlier",
          "Nice too see. That's it",
          "It's a must! Such a beautiful sight. I loved every minute of it. Make sure you don't mind getting a little wet.",
          "Different spray patterns and coloured lighting, along with some \"choreographed\" music mad for a reasonably entertaining 30mins which is nice for free. But you will need to get there up to 1hr prior to position yourself when you may be able \u2026",
          "Absolutely breathtaking! Must see.",
          "One of the best free attractions of the city. Make sure you get there with at least 30 min in advance to get some good seats. It's not Las Vegas, but it has some really good songs and a spectacular light show. It is nice  for children too, although it could be a little too long for them.",
          "Heard about this place but what I was told didn't do it justice. The crowds were amazing and it really is a must see on a visit here. Plenty of public transport to help you get here too. Definitely needs to be put on places to see list for any visitor to Barcelona. Top notch.",
          "Very cool, well worth catching the show. It lasts about 30 minutes and is very cool to watch. The opening Queen song Barcelona has s cheesy but in a cool way. Highly recommend checking it out one evening if your in Barcelona, get there early so you can get a good spot, best place to watch is on one of the bridges.",
          "Magic fountain is a good show to see but there is actually nothing very special.  Sometimes they play very good music but sometimes it is just irrelevant. But it is nice to watch all the harmony of the lights and the water flowing in the air. But if you are a tourist and if you have little time in here I wouldn't bother to come.",
          "Very nice place to see in Barcelona,  eben more at the evening when there is the fountain show",
          "Amazing place and incredible fountain show at night! If you want to get a good spot, have to come early (at least 1 hour before it starts). Would highly recommend",
          "Great usually. Closed on Jan and Feb 2020.",
          "Spectacular treat to see. They only perform on some nights as they are expensive to maintain and operate. You can check the Barcelona city council website to learn nights of operation. Colorful, beautiful and entertaining.",
          "Best place to spend evening time in Bercelona..",
          "Check the show times online!!! Very busy for shows and taxi can be hard to find so be prepared. Lots of your buses.  Music is pop first 30 minutes then classical. No charge and vendors on side for drinks. Worth putting it on your Barcelona itinerary.",
          "There is not great upkeep of this area, it could be alot cleaner, and restored. The escalators could be manually stopped by pedestrians, and someone attempted to pickpocket me during the commotion of it being stopped while people were on it.",
          "Amazing show... Worth coming always but you need to check the times and days because it is not daily.. They have a website for that... Come at like 30 minutes earlier if u want a very close spot",
          "It starts at 9.30pm. You have to come 1h earlier to have a good place to sit. The show was beautiful.",
          "Really great looking fountain! Although it was crowded on a Friday evening, we saw the special light, sound and fountain animations and were amazed by it. You could always find a spot to at least lean or sit on top of some walls and I would definitely recommend this to everyone visiting Barcelona. It's free!",
          "Very big fountain with nice water plays and lights effect... the only that could be improved is the audio quality, sometimes you can not really notice the fountain dance through the music...",

          "Personally, this is the best place to see in Barcelona. Although the fountains did not work when I visited it, the place remained impressive. From the top there is a city view and the park is nice. The only negative thing is that there was no security or police to take care of security and order. An evening visit can be dangerous.",

          "Amazing show. Immensely popular so arrive in plenty of time to get a decent vantage point for watching.",
          "The show was wonderful and last for 30 min at least but we leave before it ended. You have to get there at least two hours ahead of the show in order to get a great position. Remember, don't get too close otherwise, you will get wet.",

          "Kids loved this.  It was a little confusing though because we thought it was going to be two different shows at 8 and 8:30, but it seemed like one long show instead.",
          "Absolutely stunning but I wish there would be more diversity in music or just different shows.",
          "I very enjoyed the show which is for more than 1 hour. Different type of music and thanks to the close gallery, u can enjoy various views over the city and fountains. I would put music a bit louder, thow. There is a lot of possibilities to \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Columbus Monument (Catalan: Monument a Colom, IPA: [munu\u02c8ment \u0259 ku\u02c8lom]; Spanish: Monumento a Col\u00f3n or Mirador de Col\u00f3n) is a 60 m (197 ft) tall monument to Christopher Columbus at the lower end of La Rambla, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was constructed for the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona (1888) in honor of Columbus' first voyage to the Americas. The monument serves as a reminder that Christopher Columbus reported to Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand V in Barcelona after his first trip to the new continent.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Statue and column ===\nAt the very top of the monument stands a 7.2 m (24 ft) tall bronze statue atop a 40 m (131 ft) tall Corinthian column. The statue was sculpted by Rafael Atch\u00e9 and is said to depict Columbus pointing towards the New World with his right hand, while holding a scroll in the left. It is a commonly held belief that instead of pointing to the west towards the New World, the statue points east towards Columbus's supposed home city of Genoa. This, however, is not true, as the statue points south-southeast (a more southerly direction than the adjacent Rambla Del Mar and almost a perfect extension of the direction of La Rambla, Barcelona) and in effect is pointing at a point somewhere near the city of Constantine, Algeria. To point at Genoa in northern Italy the statue would have to face east-northeast and point up the coastline. It is more likely that the statue is situated in the current way simply to have Columbus point out to sea underscoring his achievements in naval exploration. The statue is atop a socle, on which the word \"Tierra\" (land) is inscribed.\n\n\n=== Pedestal ===\n\nThe column, hung with a device bearing an anchor, stands on an octagonal pedestal from which four bronze winged victories or Phemes take flight towards the four corners of the world, above paired griffins. Four buttresses against the octagonal pedestal bear portrait medallions that depict persons related to Columbus:\n\nMart\u00edn Alonzo Pinz\u00f3n\nVicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n\nFerdinand II of Aragon\nIsabella I of Castile\nFather Juan P\u00e9rez\nFather Antonio de Marchena\nAndr\u00e9s de Cabrera, Marqu\u00e9s de Moya\nBeatriz Fern\u00e1ndez de Bobadilla, Marquessa de MoyaSeated against the buttresses are four figures that represent four realms of Spain: the Principality of Catalonia, and the kingdoms of Le\u00f3n, Aragon, and Castile. \nAgainst the base of the pedestal between the buttresses are four additional statues:\n\nJaume Ferrer, a Mallorcan cartographer\nLuis de Sant\u00e1ngel Bessant\nCaptain Pedro Bertran i de Margarit, next to a kneeling Native American.\nFather Bernat de Bo\u00efl, preaching to a kneeling Native American.An elevator inside the column takes visitors up to a viewing platform at the top (just below the socle).\n\n\n=== Plinth ===\n\nThe canted octagonal plinth is inset with eight bronze bas-relief panels that depict important scenes in Columbus's first voyage to the Americas:\n\nColumbus and his son asking for food at the La Rabida Monastery\nColumbus explaining his plans to the monks of the La Rabida Monastery\nColumbus meeting King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in C\u00f3rdoba\nColumbus appearing at the council gathering in the Monastery of San Esteban in Salamanca\nColumbus meeting the King and Queen in Santa Fe\nColumbus leaving port from Palos de la Frontera on 3 August 1492\nColumbus's arrival in the New World\nColumbus greeting the King and Queen after his return in BarcelonaAlternating with the bas-reliefs are eight coats-of-arms representing locations that Columbus visited:\n\nHuelva\nC\u00f3rdoba\nSalamanca\nSanta Fe\nMoguer\nPuerto Rico\nCuba\nBarcelona\n\n\n=== Base ===\n\nThe base of the monument is a 20 m (66 ft) wide circle, with four staircases. Each staircase is flanked by two lions.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe idea of a monument to Columbus came in 1856 from Antoni Fages i Ferrer, who proposed that it be constructed entirely by Catalans, but he got nowhere with his plan for sixteen years. Finally in 1872 he gained the support of the mayor of the city, Francesc Rius i Taulet, and in 1881 the city passed a resolution to build the monument. A contest was held exclusively for Spanish artists to submit their designs with the winner being Gaiet\u00e0 Buigas i Monrav\u00e0, a Catalan. Most of the money was privately raised; only twelve percent of it was financed by public funds. All of the funding came from Spanish sources and the entire construction (labour and materials) was done by Catalans. Construction began in 1882 and was completed in 1888 in time for the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\nCopies of the monument are located in L'Arbo\u00e7 (Tarragona, Spain; statue only), Shima Spanish Village (Shima, Mie, Japan), Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain), and miniature versions at the Catalunya en Miniatura park (Torrelles de Llobregat, Spain) and at the Mini-Europe park (Brussels, Belgium).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nvan der Krogt, Peter. \"Barcelona: Columbus Monument\".

          "This does what it says: you ride up the column in a tiny lift that takes no more than three and from the top there are views of the city. However the space at the top is tiny - enough for only 10-12 - and so it is a quick and cramped experience.",

          "I would recommend spending the 6 euro per person to take the lift inside the column up to the viewing platform. The views are great, it's not the highest point you can get to in Barcelona but you get great close up views of the city. The lift is quite small, don't try it if",

          "This is a nice statue near the harbour, at the end of the Rambla. It's worth to walk there and see it. It's a great monument of a famous historic man, the well-known explorer. We took lots of photos. If you want you can go to the top of the monument and have a lovely view.",
          "Brilliant way to learn more about this imposing column and fascinating man. We decided to add the wine tasting to the ticket price - only 8 euros total. You get to choose one glass of wine from several options and sit for a while in the wine cellar. The sommelier was friendly",

          "This is almost at the port end of the Rambla, and it's well worth strolling down the Rambla to the port and seeing it as both the Rambla and the port area are not to be missed. You can take the elevator up for a good view.",
          "This is a large column in the city, it is near the water and it is worth having a look at. It is a bit of a walk from the main area, but it is worth taking the time to come and explore the greater area.",

          "We ordered the ticket before going there. It was a little bit of waiting to take the lift, but it was not more than 15 minutes. The statue was very beautiful and it was so cool to be inside and see the whole city from bird perspective! The view was amazing and this is absolutely",

          "Impressive monument built for the 1882Barcelona exposition. \u20ac6 ride to the top in the original 3-person, hydraulic (now electric) elevator is worth the view! Enter through the tourist visitor center located at the base of the monument.",

          "This is a statue so not a great deal to say about it. As an anchor point of La Rambla, you will likely run into it. He is pointing south west which doesn't make much sense, I guess it is just out to sea. Wouldn't West make more sense? He has an orange life vest on his arm",
          "Whether you want to Las Ramblas into the tourist blvd or you want to walk along the beach promenade, the Columbus monument is a great starting point.",
          "Can't say too much, large monument to the main man with him perched on top. Good reference spot and at the bottom of Las Ramblas. Not a 'must' see but take the sight in if you are there.",

          "It\u2019s not obvious as you look at the monument sitting in the middle of a major roundabout next to the port area that you can go up to the top of the tower. The cost is reasonable and it gives you access to some of the history at the base but also a ride in one of the smallest",
          "We bought the ticket including wine (red or white) and went up to the top. It's tight up there but we got some great photos. The monument is hard to miss, right next to Barceloneta beach/area and at the end of La Rambla. Closest metro station is L3: Drassanes.",

          "Great area at the bottom of the Ramblas that expresses the history of Columbus - worth the drive by at least",
          "For less than 5 \u20ac to the top. I was the sole visitor on a Tuesday afternoon. Stay as long as you want. Great views over the city of Barcelona and the port.",
          "A wonderful tribute to a great explorer and a great landmark at the end of the Las Ramblas. We used it as a meeting point in case we got separated in the crowds. It was a beautiful sunny day so the monument stood out. We also got to see it at night with the spotlights in full",
          "Located close to La Barceloneta, this monument is worth contemplating. I was surprised how tall this was. Make sure you take in the surroundings and stop to take pictures.",

          "You will find Columbus when finishing Las Ramblas and getting to the port. Amazing location and nice pictures on the lions below monument, it is a must! I do not recommend climbing unless you want to spend 6\u20ac. Better views from Montjuic, but good if you have some spare time or",
          "We arrived a little late as the sun was going down, but the views were still amazing. You can open the windows but I wasn't brave enough. I was to scared to lose my phone! The guy (tall, slim man, spoke Catalan, English, Spanish and Italian) was so helpful and a great laugh. He",
          "Fun to visit the top and see the city and the sea. Elevator to the top. Elevator operator takes his job very seriously. Wouldn't tell us how many people visit daily because he was afraid for the terrorists to target them. Anyway, a pleasant site and nice break from walking",

          "This monument is huge, and right in the middle of a very busy traffic area. But don't let that stop you. It is worth seeing. Impressive statues adorn the lower section with Columbus pointing West from the top. At least that's what the guide said. My directions were horribly",
          "Also referred to as the Columbus Monument. Situated between the bottom of La Rambla and the Harbour you have to cross a very busy multi-lane road so it is important to watch for the pedestrian traffic light to turn green.This is a fantastic monument measuring 60 metres high and",
          "I recently visited Barcelona and really wanted to travel up inside Cristobel Colon for some fantastic views of the city. The lift to the top is very small, only room for three people really, and the observation platform is quite small as well. But the view is worth it.There is a",
          "I visited the Columbus monument mid afternoon. There was no queue at the small booth in the base of the monument where you can get a \u20ac6 ticket to travel by lift to the viewing platform nearly 60m up. I spent about 15 minutes at the top looking at the city and taking photos.",
          "Myself and my boyfriend visited as a last minute activity. Lovely views when you get to the top, but wouldn't recommend if you don't like confined spaces. I imagine on a busy day you'll be waiting a while for the lift to the top (you can feel relieved that it's not stairs)",
          "Right at the mouth of the city from the port , the statue welcomes you to Barcelona . It is a couple of blocks from the port . It is a striking statue and great for pictures . There is a small lift but expensive for the event .",

          "Six euro to wait to go up in a tiny lift to a tiny observatory where, admittedly, you can see lovely views of Barcelona but through dirty windows and having to squeeze past other people trying to do the same. Not for the claustrophobic and definitely not worth the money, in my",
          "This was absolutely amazing! ideally located at the bottom of ramblas, and the port vell and maremgnum shopping centre by. we saw it in night aswell was really cool, it was very busy outside during the day with tourists taking photo etc, so we werent sure whether to go inside to",
          "We guessed it was Columbus the 1st time but we weren't sure. This is a terrific monument. It sits between La Rambla and the water. We used the monument to get our bearings when coming from the beach. You can't miss this monument if you walk to the end of La Rambla.",
          "Fitting that a monument to one of the world\u2019s greatest explorers now stands in the center of what amounts to a transportation hub. Admire it as you wait for a taxi. The surrounding statues, including the lions, are impressive. Take time to cross over to take a closer look at",

          "A historical visit to remember this significant part of history. The monument is impressive and worth a visit for a while to this impressive landmark. Right next to Port Vell. Actually is a free visit unlike most tourist sights which are expensive.",
          "While this imposing monument with an ever-vigilant Columbus perched on top is hard to miss at the far south end the Rambla; it\u2019s what hidden one flight of stairs down inside its base that makes this a unique attraction not to be over looked. In the 360-degree space that winds",
          "A tiny lift takes about 4 people to the top through the narrow column to the viewing platform beneath Christopher Columbus whose finger is pointing towards Majorca. An opportunity for 360* views of Barcelona. Then in the base of the column is a wine bar. Pay a couple of euros",
          "This huge monument located at the coast end of La Rambla stands out as a significant landmark because the statue of Columbus stands atop a very tall column. We have taken a close-up look at the monument during each of our stays in Barcelona. Our most recent visit saw us walk",
          "It is located at the end of the street Las Ramplas.It is a very good location where you can find many restaurants and cafe next to the beach, or go for a swimming. It is very overcrowded. Near Columbus monument there are many attractions that you can have access on foot",

          "If you are in the area, it is worth visiting the monument just to see how tall and impressive it is. It's very high up so it's hard to see the details at the top, however, the base is pretty cool with the massive lion statues. It gets kinda crowded with everyone trying to climb",
          "The Columbus Monument is actually one of the first major sites in Barcelona that you can recognize as you drive in from the airport. Impressive. It stands nearly 200 feet high with Columbus pointing toward somewhere. I suppose it's supposed to be the New World but I think the",
          "An amazing statue that you can see from every corner. An amazing statue connecting La Rambla and the port of Barcelona. Worth visiting with the whole family.",
          "For around six Euros a lift will zip you up to the enclosed viewing platform offering spectacular vistas of Barcelona. You may have to wait a while as the space is very resticted but for the cheap ticket it's worth it.",

          "We walked by the monument at the end of the Ramblas and while impressive no one wanted to stop and visit.",
          "Going up in the monument was okay, but it is a very small space, and you cannot see well out of the top. The best part of this was the bottom of the monument has a wine area that was very tasty!!! Go there :)",
          "You can see the statue from many angles therefore Good for orientation or as a Meeting Point. Nice see View. Recommendation: include it in a beach walk or run in the morning and Enjoy the area around the Harbour and the impressive ships.",
          "Lovely monument, great for photos, there is an information centre within it and this also has a disabled chair lift for accessibility. There are lots of photo opportunities and info only downside is there is literally no shade from the blazing sun and it's extremely crowded,",
          "Good solid statue surrounded by buildings. Landmark for walking around. Well preserved. Look what he did for the world.",
          "Typical monument on tall pedestal. Too high to really get a good look at Christopher. Lions at the base make a good photo op for kids, just look out for traffic when getting there.",
          "Mirador de Colom is located at the end of La Rambla. It was designed by Catalan architect Gaiet\u00e0 Buigas i Monrav\u00e0 for the Universal Exhibition in 1888 in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. It was a technological sensation at the time as it",

          "Unlike similar structures this monument requires no endless walking up a spiral staircase as the lift cuts that out completely. The view from the top is worth the modest entry fee and is very safe for young children.",
          "Beautiful views! Take your time to enjoy! Have the wine after so you can take in the rest of the plaza and the views of las Ramblas. Worth the ticket to the top!",

          "is situate in the port his finger show the direction to America(USA) is an important monument for catalunya",
          "Found a lovely little wine cellar and museum under the Columbus Monument. For 6 Euro you can go to the stop and get spectacular views of Barcelona. For 8 Euro, you get the views and a glass of wine. Excellent value, highly recommended.",
          "The best part about this monument is that you can go to the top and see amazing views of the Ramblas, Barri Gotic, the port, and even see the Sagrada Familia. Decently priced. I 100% recommend going to the top!",
          "The Columbus Monument was a 2.5 km walk from our hotel, but definitely worth the time it took. Just walking along Rambla de Catalunya which becomes La Rambla was great fun on a Sunday morning. La Rambla ends at the monument. I had purchased tickets online before we left home",
          "It is located by the harbour Pier and at the end of the La Ramblas. Interesting monument as you can go underneath it. Tourists go crazy climbing and taking photos with the black lions statues. Kids love it. Historically it is fascinating and the height of the column is",
          "Is one fantastic monument..where you can see the man who explored all the world..And there you can see that he is still looking through the sea..",
          "Walking along the Rambla and approaching the embankment, you will certainly see the Columbus Column. There are always a lot of people at the foot of the column: all are photographed and children certainly want to climb on numerous lions. To see the column outside is great, but",

          "We have seen this huge monument at the end of La Rambla, on our way to the waterfront, the marina and the Centre Comercial Maremagnum shopping mall. The top of the monument depicts Christopher Columbus pointing to the Americas \u2013 and that is the only part of it which we did like.",
          "The lookout at the top provides a great view over Ramblas and the harbour if like me you are not too keen on using the port cable car. Space is very tight at the top and you probably won't spend more than a few minutes at the top so buy the ticket for an additional couple of",
          "This statue is atop a high pedestal and can be easily missed. For such an important discoverer, this is not a very inspiring statue.",
          "I had lived in Barcelona for a long time before I came back to Guayaquil. I consider that I know the city very well to recommend it, there are many modern and antiQUE places to go and have A fun time. For example, I always loved walking in Las Ramblas since the Catalunya Square",
          "Great monument for representing the success of an early explorer. Tall and a good point to know where Las Rambla is located.",

          "The statue itself is majestic, very nicely decorated. We bought the 8 euro ticket (adults), which included a visit to the top of the monument with the elevator and a wine tasting. Try the cava, it's amazing!",
          "The monument commemorates Columbus' first voyage to the new world and is a reminder that he disembarked in Barcelona after returning from the new world. It was constructed for the Barcelona exposition in 1888 and is located in Port Vell at one end of the Las Ramblas. The",
          "Would never have know about elevator to the top but it's a little gem. Tight elevator ride up and little disconcerting at the top as it sort of sways.",
          "Yup, it's a statue. Very tall, so a bit hard to make out the details. It's next to the water though, so the trip won't be wasted if you go to see it.",
          "An interesting monument to see. We saw it from the bus tour we went on so did not get a lot of time to have a look or take photos. If you take one of the bus tours you will get to see it.",
          "well, the Statue ain't really impressive - it's tall, so you can see it from afar...but nothing unusual with that. We didn't go up, so I can't tell if the view is good or anything...",
          "A central monument in Barcelona close to the harbour and Los Ramblas, the main shopping shopping area in Barcelona. A good meeting point and a decent statue as well.",
          "After enduring the crowds of La Rambla and the markets, enjoy peace and relaxation by the port. Excellent views from the top. Reflect on the time in the city center, then head for the beaches of the scenic deep blue Mediterranean. Ah, life is great!",
          "Quite an impressive statue on a tall pillar. It is at the end of La Rambla, so if you are walking to the port, you will see it.",
          "I was unaware of the lift when we visited so didn't go up. The monument is surrounded by a very busy round about, so be careful crossing whilst looking up & taking photos of the monument. A handy reference point when walking around the marina. I wouldn't travel just to see",
          "A must if you are sight seeing with a difference. Take a ride up the tower for the marvelous view from the top, it's very reasonably priced.",
          "The statue is right at the end of the Las ramblas , so make sure you checkout the monument from the street view. Then venture into the gift shop and get a ticket for the elevator ride to the top of the monument. It was around 7 or 8 Euro. We added the wine tasting for 2 more",
          "Monumento a Cristoforo Colombo is an icon of Barcelona. You can't miss it and if you are there don't miss the elevator that wil take you to the top of the column so you can enjoy the wonderful views .",
          "Here Columbus has set foot on Spanish soil on his return from the first trip to America. Located at the end of La Rambla.",
          "This must be seen up close. Awesome barely describes it . The details of this monument are truly amazing. Walk around it and just take it all in. There are so many fabulous monuments/buildings/artwork to see in this fine city, but definitely find the time to visit this one!",
          "Here Columbus has moored after his successful trip to America. At the top there is a statue that points to the west. I think there are stairs inside and one can climb to the panoramic terrace at the top.",
          "It's a big roundabout with the guy pointing to the americas on top if the roundabout. There's a big sidewalk that takes you to the marina and were you can have a nice stroll. Worth a visit.",
          "This is a place that is probably not very well known. The views are amazing, but if you're claustrophobic this is not the place for you! The elevator which takes you to the top fits only 4 people very snugly inside (one of them is the elevator operator!) You get to take great",
          "Getting upstairs of the Columbus memorial is a very nice experience (6\u20ac/adult, 4\u20ac/children, free in some cases), except if you are claustrophobic and/or agoraphobic. The place upstairs is quite small, and, if there is some wind, you may get the feeling of movement. In any case,",
          "Famous statue of Colombo. Everyone should see it. It's located directly near the sea. You can also view it using the city tour bus for better view.",
          "Booked our tickets through City Discovery and took the wine tasting option. Well worth the money and the views from the top are fab. Not much space to walk round and the lift only takes 2 people plus the elevator operator. Nice to get a different perspective and view of the city",
          "Mr Columbus looks a little confused. He is pointing, not to America, but to Las Ramblas, Barcelona's most famous avenue. This is a famous landmark and you can pay to take the little lift to the top. I guess there will be good views from there, although those from Montjuic much",
          "It's good to see you at the final of the Rambla, nothing more, period. If you want to use the elevator there a good possibility to get traped there...",
          "Quite a lot of people were standing on one leg being photographed when I arrived here, I think it is because from the right hand side of La Rambla it does look as if Columbus is standing on one leg.",
          "A good way to end your walk down Las Ramblas. This very large and impressive monument to Christopher Columbus was built in a very heraldic style over 100 years ago and includes angels proclaiming Columbus' glory while lions surround the base are sitting on guard.",
          "The view is very nice from the top of the monument also you can see some curiosities about the monument. I realized about marihuane plants on the monument. Why these plants are there? Do u think Christopher Colombus discovered that plant in America plus the continent? When you",
          "This monument is emblematic of the city. We started there on our segway day and we let there for our las golondrinas day. Photos are cool and monument is very nice. Do not miss it.",
          "At the base of this stunning monument is an entrance to a shop, wine tasting and a lift to a walk round globe with a 360 view. Loved it at the top awesome view. The wine tasting was fun too. The monument itself is absolutely stunning.",
          "We came to the Monumento after strolling down La Rambla one evening. It's enormous! It's also filled with details, and lovely to look at. Great to see from a historical perspective too. Later in our stay, we viewed it from the cable car across the harbour - and it was just as",
          "No particularly advertised, but for a modest fee a guide and a tiny lift will take you right to the top from where you can get stunning views (even though the tower sways a little!) and a good grip of the city. Very enjoyable No toilet or student discount available",
          "I was not overly impressed. The statue is interesting but there are lots of cars and people. If you are in the area go and see it, but I would not go out of my way to see this.",
          "We booked this as a cheap little addition to our itinerary- I think it was something like \u20ac7 each to go up the tower and enjoy a glass of wine or ros\u00e9 Cava afterwards. For this reason, I wouldn't say don't do it (it does offer some lovely views) but I wouldn't make it your",
          "For me, Columbus is like a historic guy, whose name everybody should know. Drop by while you walk at Las Rambles. You should come.",
          "This monument of Columbus is huge and can be seen from quite a distance away - not sure he got it right where he wanted to go, but anyway they made a statue of him.",
          "We saw this dude from quite a way off, pointing at the sea or Germany or Madagascar or wherever he is pointing. Turns out he wanted to get to the East of India, but bumped into the Bahamas instead! Awks. Anyway, this bloke is Italian, but worked for Spain or summat. He didn't",
          "Located on the harbor end of Las Ramblas this monument is situated in the middle of a traffic circle. There is a small museum situated underneath and for an entry fee the ability to go up for views of the harbor and Gothic Quarter. Smaller statues surround the main monument.",
          "I really enjoyed this. You get up on a tiny lift and but once upstairs the views are very good. It was originally opened in 1888 for one Barcelona's World Fair.",
          "Out of all the places to visit in Barcelona, this one is not worth the time. If you are wanting pictures, take the ride to Montjuic. You will get lots of GREAT pictures that way.",
          "The outside of the monument is very nicely done. But going to the top, not so much. It is pretty much a ball on top of a spindle. The space at the TOP is very, very small. And you can feel movement, so it isn't very stable. It smelled really bad too. If you are looking for good",
          "We didn't spend a lot of time here but it's most definitely worth a visit. It's very well kept and it's excellent for photo opportunities.",
          "This is an impressive monument on a roundabout at the end of Las Ramblas and although a \"must see\" is more a \"can't miss\" because it towers over the area. For a fee you can enter and go to the viewing gallery in the crown to get views of the city.....",
          "This was our very first attraction to check out in Barcelona. This monument tells a very interesting about Spain \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8",
          "Very nice monument at the end of Las Ramblas near Maremagnum. It is free to walk around the monument, you can go up the monument for some fabulous views of the city.",
          "if you are traveling on your own, you would not know all the stories about the all figures on the monument - it's just a statue in mid of crossing. If you choose to go and listen to full excursion then it has more sense. In general - if you spend at least few days in Barcelona,",
          "You can get tickets for going up the column in the tourist office below the monument. The lift is quick and there are good views all around from inside the crown, below the statue itself. We paid a couple of euros extra to have a glass of wine as well in 'wine bar' in the",
          "It was good to visit Barcelona during the low season, so I was lucky not to wait a long queue before getting up the Monument. Its a small lift only and they will only allow abt.10 people max on top of the tower to enjoy a perfect view over the harbor. Without discount (eg.",
          "The Columbus monument in Barcelona is a huge monument with lots of statues of al the role players at the time of the journey of Cristophorus Columbus to America. The statue gives you a real and very interesting impression . If you are in Barcelona surely take a look at this",
          "Situated at the bottom of La Rambla just by the port is the Columbus Monument. Definitely worth taking the time to have a look.",
          "Seems like he's pointing towards Algeria Actually quite a nice tribute though with his story drawn the whole way around the base Paints a bit too much of a story of a hero about him if you ask me though",
          "Situated on a roundabout at the end of Las Ramblas this is hard to miss but impressive as well. Try and work out where he is pointing too.",
          "This is a must to see, but you do get neck ache marveling at the statue, gets really busy with tourists so taking photos without them in the background is difficult.",
          "Great monument to visit whilst in Barcelona and it's free ! :) It leads on to the harbour and then onto the beach if you keep going.",
          "Really an amazing and interesting spectacle to see before my journey home. Interesting piece of history in the heart of Barcelona",
          "My wife, two children and I visited Barcelona in December 2016 and January 2017. After visiting the Picasso Museum and the Basilica Santa Maria del Mar, my wife and children took a taxi back to the hotel and I continued walking. It is about another 15 minutes walking to the",
          "Well worth the taking the lift to the top to get some great photos. The space at the top is very cramped and there is no real opportunity to relax so would not expect to be up there for more than 15 minutes. However, thought this was worth the 6 Euro ticket cost and was",
          "It was my wife's ninth visit to Barcelona, and my fifth - and we had never been up the Columbus Column. So one fine Sunday afternoon we got our tickets - there were not even any queues - and stepped into the lift. While going up we had a heated discussion with the attendant on",
          "One of the most interesting monuments in Barcelona. Just near the port. I would recommand to visit the viewing platform as well! You cant get great views of port and Rambla from any other place...",

          "We did a bike tour that went down Las Ramblas to the port and this location is at the end of the road. Pretty stunning sculpture and easy to view.",
          "A towering monument that can be seen from a distance; we did not have enough time during our stay to go to the top, but it does seems worth considering because of the height of the observation deck.",
          "The monument itself is pretty interesting. But what is more interesting it that a very old hydraulic lift takes you up to the top of the monument for a birds eye view of the port and the city! Really beautiful. Once satiated with the view head down to their wine bar either",

          "The monument is towering and cool, but I was super bummed to discover that he doesn't even point to the Americas. Or to India. He just points... that way. The surrounding area is nice and it's a monumental finish to La Rambla.",
          "The Christopher Columbus statue - aka Chris on a Stick - was pretty neat, but I give it a three because he's pointing in the wrong direction. He's supposed to be pointing toward the Americas, but instead is pointing to Africa (even though he's probably just pointing at the sea).",

          "A stunning memorial to a key time in history. The monument features stone-carved tableaux depicting key players in the thinking, planning and preparation of the journey undertaken by Columbus. This is well worth a visit.",
          "They really got this statue high up in the air. It's a very tall pillar, you have to crane your neck to see the top. There was a cool flea market near the base on Sunday.",
          "This is a nice place to take pictures and see the massive monument. Come here after shopping and eating at Las Ramblas and then walk down to find this. Once your here you can make your way down to Port Vell and enjoy a boat ride and it's near the Maremagnum shopping centre. It",

          "It is worth taking the microscopic lift to the top of the monument to get a view of the port area of Barcelona. It is not that high and the room at the top is tiny but interesting none the less. Also, in the wind on the day i visited it was definitely swaying! Interesting",

          "Many don't know this, but this is the only Columbus Monument that doesn't point to the Americas, as the kingdom of spain forbad it, since Barcelona refused loaning money to Columbus in order for him to get his expedition started.",
          "This, from the outside, is a huge pillar with a statue of Christopher Columbus on top. It is well made and the design is interesting. The secret though is inside. When you go in and pay 6 Euros (50% less if you have a BCN card) you will be directed to a lift. The operator will",
          "Obviously, the discovery of America by Cristoforo Colombo is a huge deal and it had to be commemorated properly. So it gotta be some monument built. Unfortunately, the monument looks exactly how would you expect it to be. It's a tall column with some decorations and a statue on",
          "Situated at the sea end of Las Ramblas between it and the port most people will see this fascinating monument.Impressively high and ornately decorated this is well worth a look.",
          "We came with our grandchildren to see the monument and talk about Cristofer Colombo and his discoveries. Yona s.",
          "Another monument to take pictures of when walking to the waterfront. one of those places to see, things to do. If you are not in the area, you will not be missing something monumental.",
          "It was very exiting to be around and honor such a great person in world history. The story about how his remains crossed the ocean back and forth was something I did not realize",
          "As far as statues of Columbus go, this is a good one. The kids will enjoy climbing on one of the eight lions that ring the statue to have their picture taken. Not recommended for children under 8 or 9.",
          "This is a hidden gem, it is a monument that is on a roundabout at the bottom of La Rambles near to the port, if you go over onto the roundabout there is 2 entrances below it that leads to an information centre a wine bar and a lift to the top where you get a 360 degree view of",
          "At the end of Las Rambles, near the harbor, you will find a tall monument with a statue of Christopher Columbus pointing the way to America. Most people will walk past this attraction on the way to/from the harbor area from Las Rambles.",
          "This is a huge statue of great Columbus near the harbor area of city. This is also the end point of famous La Rambla walkway. The monument has been made as a round about and traffic is very heavy so one has to be careful when approaching to the monument. The statue is so high",
          "This dude is perched up a lot higher than it seems. It's great seeing visitors and students gather around the foot of the statue and look up tO take pictures. Such a monumental masterpiece and an iconic part of Barca. It can be seen from the sea as the ships come in.",
          "A highlight when visiting this great city! It is on busy roundabout but worth a visit... On foot! Although Se\u00f1or Cristobal is pointing the wrong way, there is an explanation!",
          "Yes it is the monument of columbus amazing statue of the amazing man who went cross the seas how ever the statue in the region called (la rambla ) in the heart barcelona.",
          "Barcelona is a really unique city with the sea, mountain, and city center all in a row. The Columbus monument is near the world trade area where the cruise ships come in, so there's a nice breeze that comes through.",
          "When we were about to buy our tickets we were asked if we also wanted to pay for a glass of wine each. This has to be drunk before or after you go in the lift. The lady who served us our wine was very knowledgeable and recommended a white wine for me and a red one for Graham. We",
          "The Columbus monument or 'Monumento a Col\u00f3n or Mirador de Col\u00f3n' is 60 m (197 ft) high and can be found at the lower end of La Rambla in Barcelona. It was built in 1888 in honour of Columbus' first voyage to the Americas Even though he was Italian he was still subordinate to",
          "Whatever your views may be about Mr. Columbus claim to fame, taking the small elevator to the top of the monument is worthwhile. You will experience a 360 degree view of Barcelona and appreciate its beauty from a different perspective.",
          "Was amazing to see but takes about 5 minutes. Lovely area to wonder around and see some amazing architecture.",
          "We were walking by it every day. Its a fine monument, but it was not a must see for us. But Im glad that we saw it.",
          "Was under renovation when we visited in November so couldn't go up for the view. Stands at the bottom of the Rambles and easy to find. Worth a visit",
          "The monument is a nice ending to a walk down Ramblas. The 200 foot tall statue is very impressive. It also makes a fabulous photo op.",
          "This statu is in the middle of Barca. They say Columbus points Amerika but i think he is pointing a wrong direction :)",
          "Great monument in the center of the city.The monument is located right in the Gothic Quarter, just before Las Ramblas. Seconds away is the port and Maremagnum",
          "Best time to go there is probably the golden hour, before the sun sets below the horizon. It is very cramped up there, but views are very extraordinary. For less adventorous people there is danger to feel claustrofobic and the statue is moving a bit as the wind is blowing fromt",
          "I love these sort of things but have never experienced fear at heights like this monument. I expect it's because there are no steps, you have to wait for Joan to come up and collect you in the lift and there are windows open when you're not expect them to be. I also think",
          "An amazing column especially as you can jump in the lift to the top. The plinth has such detail and all this for someone who was not even Spanish. We took the tour and wine combo ticket and after a quick ride in the small but efficient lift we came back down to the wine cellar.",
          "The monument is at the end of the Ramblas, near the sea. You go up with a very narrow elevator, and can enjoy a view of the port and the area near it. One of the few cheap attractions at Barcelona.",
          "We were thrilled we did this. The view of the entire city and port is amazing. The exhibits are informative.",
          "The view is interesting, though partly obscured by the decorations. The main problem is the limited space at the top, so the queue moves very slowly. Maximum 3 people in the lift. Unless the queue is VERY short, I suggest you admire it from the base and save your time to see",
          "The statue of Christopher Columbus, holding a navigational map in one hand and pointing to America with the other, stands on the top of this 52 meters high iron column. The statue is guarded by lions and surrounded by reliefs with motifs and details of explorer\u2019s life and",
          "The monument is great and there is a huge variety of things to do and see in the surrounding area. Its at the end of La Rambla which is the main bustling tourist street but also close to the gothic quarter, port Vell and a short walk from the beach. Definitely worth a visit if",

          "At the end of the Las Ramblas, towards the harbour, is the impressive column-style monument of Columbus. Fittingly overlooking the sea, this is an interesting photo stop.",
          "This is a good reference point in the area because the monument is so tall, that you can see it from a far distance.",
          "This was the first attraction we came across on our Barcelona trip, so we decided to get to the top straight away. It is an ideal place to take fantastic panoramic photos and you are taken to the top by a lift which is operated by a guard. (This way you feel more secure.) The",
          "If you follow Las Ramblas all the way down to the harbor, you will see this statue. It is right in the middle of a traffic circle. You really can't miss it. We talked to some locals and were happy to learn that Christopher Columbus has not fallen from grace in Spain as he has in",
          "This is not something that you travel to Barcelona to see. However, if you make it to the end of LaRamble, there it it. This statue mean something for us Americans because he sort of discovered us. I don't think he is pointing toward America, but he is at least pointing out to",
          "Columbus is pointing in the wrong direction, the Americas are not that way. You get 50% off with the Barcelona Card if you want to visit Columb Mirador. Nice way to see the port an the Ramblas!",

          "We had gone there; the weather was fine abd it was sunny. We had taken many pictures. It was a good memory.",
          "The monument itself is quite imposing at the beginning of La Rambla. Plenty of photo ops nearby with the marina. Cheap tickets to go up the elevator. We went mid week early in the day and we were the only ones there. The lift can only really take 3 visitors at a time so I",
          "Good view but gets very busy due to its location. I've been once, wouldn't go again... No need to. Btourist trap",
          "We arrived after a long day of gaudi sites and the sun was just setting. The monument is well lit so you can visit any time. it's in the cent of a busy street so don't be backing up to far to get that photo.",

          "You can't miss this monument if you are in Barcelona. It is at the end of La Rambla and close to the Marina, very tall and big. We did not go upstairs to see the look, because we already saw Barcelona several times from bird perspective- from Monjuic, Parc Guell... We just took",
          "Wasn't expecting to see this so it was a good surprise. Apparently you can pay to go inside and get a view. I was happy by admiring for outside and using the tower as a guide when I was a bit lost and needed to find out the direction ;p",

          "You can get the lift that goes up inside the column to the very top. The lift is small and can only take a couple of people at a time, which could be claustrophobic to some people. When you reach the top you walk out on to a covered balcony that is 360 degree views over",
          "On the water side of the tower steps lead down to the entrance. There is a very small lift to take you up the tower after purchasing a 6 Euro adult ticket. You can spend as long as you want at the top, but there is only room for about 8-10 people and 10 mins is probably enough.",

          "Took a wee walk to the Columbus Monument as part of a day tour to Barcelona. The monument itself is reasonably impressive, and a decent tribute to the explorer. I did not realize till afterwards that for a couple of Euro you could take a lift inside it to the top and admire",
          "Not sure if people are aware of the option to go up inside the column to a viewing platform. I expected a wait to go up particularly as the lift only takes up to 4 people with an attendant. Great views of the port, Montjuic and across the city of Barcelona. Very helpful to get",

          "This tall monument at the tip of Las Ramblas is nothing out of this world, but it's a great little visual marker. There's not much to do per say at this plaza, but take a look at the stone art at the base of the monument, each side tells a different story.",

          "Most people around the world have hear of Christoffer Columbus or Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n (Spanish name). Even to this day there are a lot of misconceptions and unclear information regarding his life and heritage. There are more than one costal town in the Mediterranean sea, that",

Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac840,8 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s.Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 74 trophies: 26 La Liga, 30 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, 3 Copa Eva Duarte, and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 20 European and worldwide titles: 5 UEFA Champions League titles, a record 4 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a joint record 5 UEFA Super Cup, a record 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and 3 FIFA Club World Cup. Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015 and currently occupies the second position on the UEFA club rankings. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid; matches between the two teams are referred to as El Cl\u00e1sico.\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won a record number of Ballon d'Or awards (12), with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including Ronaldo, Rom\u00e1rio, Ronaldinho, and Rivaldo. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record number (8) of European Golden Shoe awards.\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice. The highest paid sports team in the world, in November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of \u00a310m ($13.8m) per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1899\u20131922: Beginnings ===\n\nOn 22 October 1899, Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Sol\u00e9 on 29 November. Eleven players attended \u2013 Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Llu\u00eds d'Oss\u00f3, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons \u2013 and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.\n\nFC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1\u20132 to Bizcaya in the final. In 1908, Hans Gamper \u2013 now known as Joan Gamper \u2013 became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\" Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Bar\u00e7a acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Ind\u00fastria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears \u2013 with some minor changes \u2013 as of the present day.With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era. From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917. The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ram\u00f3n Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6-2.Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first \"golden age\".\n\n\n=== 1923\u20131957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War ===\n\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club. On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko. On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escol\u00e0, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters. Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938, success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them.\nA month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices. A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de F\u00fatbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del General\u00edsimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3\u20130. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11\u20131. According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11\u20131 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\" It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.\n\nDespite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like C\u00e9sar, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2\u20131 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.Coach Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del General\u00edsimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del General\u00edsimo again.\n\n\n=== 1957\u20131978: Club de F\u00fatbol Barcelona ===\n\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Su\u00e1rez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Zolt\u00e1n Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2\u20133 to Benfica in the final.\n\nThe 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fust\u00e9 and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del General\u00edsimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1\u20130 in the 1968 Copa del General\u00edsimo final at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in front of Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.The 1973\u201374 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record \u00a3920,000 from Ajax. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973\u201374 season for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5\u20130 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.\n\n\n=== 1978\u20132000: N\u00fa\u00f1ez and stabilization ===\n\nIn 1978, Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N\u00fa\u00f1ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Rom\u00e1rio and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.On 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf 4\u20133 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, N\u00fa\u00f1ez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.\n\nIn June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of \u00a35 million from Boca Juniors. In the following season, under coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984\u201385 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua Bucure\u0219ti during a dramatic evening in Seville.Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president N\u00fa\u00f1ez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for N\u00fa\u00f1ez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987\u201388 season and replaced with Luis Aragon\u00e9s. The season finished with the players rebelling against president N\u00fa\u00f1ez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1\u20130 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.\n\n\n==== The Dream Team era ====\n\nIn 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\". He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Rom\u00e1rio and Hristo Stoichkov.\n\nIt was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was future Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.\nUnder Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez, resulting in his departure. On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, \"Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.\"Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of N\u00fa\u00f1ez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996\u201397. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer. However, new heroes emerged, such as Lu\u00eds Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera Divisi\u00f3n title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and N\u00fa\u00f1ez resigning in 2000.\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132008: Exit N\u00fa\u00f1ez, enter Laporta ===\n\nThe departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.\n\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael M\u00e1rquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Xavi and V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a in 2004\u201305, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in a 3\u20130 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernab\u00e9u, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation. In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1\u20130 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2\u20131, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006\u201307 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5\u20132, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4\u20130. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional. In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.Barcelona finished the 2007\u201308 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4\u20131 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.\n\n\n=== 2008\u20132012: Guardiola era ===\n\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season. Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Lionel Messi.\n\nBar\u00e7a beat Athletic Bilbao 4\u20131 in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2\u20136 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008\u201309 La Liga champions. Bar\u00e7a finished the season by beating Manchester United 2\u20130 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team. The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk, becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup. Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a for a ninth time.After Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes. Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for \u20ac40 million and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for \u20ac19 million. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of which were Barcelona players whom started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5\u20130 in El Cl\u00e1sico.\nAt the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010. In the 2010\u201311 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points. In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1\u20130 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia. In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final 3\u20131 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup. In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc F\u00e0bregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2\u20130 with goals from Messi and F\u00e0bregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies. The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.\n\nIn December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4\u20130 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and F\u00e0bregas. As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16. Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, \u201dThey mesmerise you with their passing\u201d, their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.In the 2011\u201312 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections, announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova. Guardiola finished his tenure with Bar\u00e7a winning the Copa del Rey final 3\u20130, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Bar\u00e7a had won under his coaching.It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2\u20131 to them at the beginning of March. They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.\n\n\n=== 2014\u2013present: Bartomeu era ===\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013\u201314 season. Barcelona's first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, which Bar\u00e7a won 1\u20131 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016.\n\nOn 17 May, in a game where they needed to defeat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (who had eliminated them from the Champions League in the quarter-finals earlier in the year) to be crowned champions of La Liga for the 23rd time, they drew after Atl\u00e9tico defender Diego God\u00edn headed in the equaliser in the 49th minute, giving Atl\u00e9tico the championship.Barcelona won the treble in the 2014\u201315 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice. On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years. On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou. On 6 June, Barcelona won the Champions League final with a 3\u20131 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years. Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.\n\nOn 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015\u201316 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5\u20134 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3\u20130 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Su\u00e1rez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament. The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly. By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010\u201311 season, with a 1\u20131 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015\u201316 Copa del Rey. With a 5\u20131 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988\u20131989 season. After Bar\u00e7a reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2\u20131 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou. On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons. The front three of Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season. On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League in second Leg, beating Paris Saint-Germain by a score of 6\u20131 (aggregate score 6\u20135), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4\u20130. On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor signing a two-year contract with an option for a further year.On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\". The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors. Two directors, Jordi Mon\u00e9s and Carles Vilarrub\u00ed, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played. Winning La Liga for the 2017\u201318 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5\u20131 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history. On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.On 13 January 2020, former Real Betis coach Quique Seti\u00e9n replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona, following the loss to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Spanish Supercup.\n\n\n== Support ==\n\nThe nickname cul\u00e9 for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Ind\u00fastria, sat with their culs over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Bar\u00e7a sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population. Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003\u201304 season to 170,000 in September 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.In addition to membership, as of 2015 there are 1,267 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world. The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona. Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2017, just behind Real Madrid. The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.\n\n\n== Club rivalries ==\n\n\n=== El Cl\u00e1sico ===\n\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Cl\u00e1sico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nDuring the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923\u20131930) and especially of Francisco Franco (1939\u20131975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Bar\u00e7a became 'More than a club' (M\u00e9s que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Bar\u00e7a. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael S\u00e1nchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.\nDuring the 1950s, the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee, In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people. An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams \u2013 often involving mocking the opposition \u2013 one such notable celebration occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.\n\n\n=== El derbi Barcelon\u00ed ===\n\nBar\u00e7a's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Bar\u00e7a's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarri\u00e0.Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Bar\u00e7a's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera divisi\u00f3n league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Bar\u00e7a on three occasions from 81 seasons (1928\u20132016) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Bar\u00e7a in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6\u20130 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5\u20130 on six occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992 and 2016). Espanyol achieved a 2\u20131 win against Bar\u00e7a during the 2008\u201309 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.\n\n\n=== Rivalry with A.C. Milan ===\n\nBarcelona's rival in European football is Italian club A.C. Milan. The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the second most played match in European competitions, tied with Real Madrid\u2013Juventus and both after Real Madrid\u2013Bayern Munich (24). Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Bar\u00e7a's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups. Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 20 and 18 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 27.Barcelona leads the Head-To-Head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959\u201360 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Bar\u00e7a won the tie on a 7\u20131 aggregate score (0\u20132 in Milan and 5\u20131 in Barcelona). While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4\u20130 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs. In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0\u20132 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012\u201313 Champions League, winning 4\u20130 at the Camp Nou.\n\n\n== Ownership and finances ==\n Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2016, the club has 140,000 socis.In 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around \u20ac752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008\u201309 season. According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of \u20ac366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated \u20ac401 million in revenue. In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion. In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac484.6 million. In 2017, Forbes ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion. The world's highest paid sports team, in November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of \u00a310m ($13.8m) per year.\n\n\n== Records ==\n\nXavi presently holds the team record for most number of total games played (767) and the record number of La Liga appearances (505), Lionel Messi comes second with 718 in all competitions and 474 in the League.\n\nBarcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in all competitions (including friendlies) is Lionel Messi with 662 goals, surpassing Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara's record (369 goals) held for 87 years, as well as being the highest goalscorer in official competitions with 627 goals. He is also the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European (117 goals) and international club competitions (122 goals), and the record league scorer with 438 goals in La Liga. Alongside Messi, four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for the club: C\u00e9sar (190), Luis Su\u00e1rez (142), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108). Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 65 goals.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gij\u00f3n in 1952. Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Eulogio Mart\u00ednez became Bar\u00e7a's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1957.\nBarcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s winning a record five each. Vald\u00e9s had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record, and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona. Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.\n\nBarcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917\u20131924) and (1931\u20131933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 34 trophies, surpassing Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, with 32 trophies.Barcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986. The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.El Bar\u00e7a de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951\u20131952). Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve the continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever football team to complete the sextuple. In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for \u20ac120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history. In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of \u20ac222 million.In 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.\n\n\n== Kits and crest ==\n\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm. The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028, for a record \u20ac155 million per year.\n\n\n=== Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors ===\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nBarcelona initially played in the Camp de la Ind\u00fastria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Bar\u00e7a was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make plans for a new stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Bar\u00e7a fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.\n\nIn 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.There are also other facilities, which include:\nCiutat Esportiva Joan Gamper (FC Barcelona's training ground)\nMasia-Centre de Formaci\u00f3 Oriol Tort (Residence of young players)\nMini Estadi (Home of the reserve team)\nPalau Blaugrana (FC Barcelona indoor sports arena)\nPalau Blaugrana 2 (Secondary indoor arena of FC Barcelona)\nPalau de Gel (FC Barcelona ice rink)\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\nS Shared record\n\n\n== Players ==\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.\n\n\n=== Current squad ===\nAs of 20 February 2020Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

          "This cathedral has many visitors and it is now necessary to pre-book a ticket to enter. Don't forget to look up outside for the domestic and mythical gargoyles.",
          "The Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia, also known as Barcelona Cathedral or Le Seu, is a Gothic Cathedral constructed from the 13th to 15th centuries (7 Euros per person senior admission). This was our first encounter with the elaborate use of gold in altarpieces",

          "The audioguide was a bit confusing but there were several signs describing the different parts. I always prefer a person conducting the guiding.",
          "Of course everyone is heading to visit La Sagrada, and they should.. but if you want to visit a beautiful gem burrowed in the heart of the Gothic Quarter go here. No fees, beautiful art and architecture. Tons of great photo ops. And the geese in the courtyard is very cool. Also",

          "The Barcelona Cathedral is an old Gothic Cathedral. According to record, Christian baptistry was first established here in the 6th century. Later, it was replaced by Romanesque in the 11th century before it became the current Gothic cathedral. Although this is not the most",

          "This Cathedral is likely overlooked because it lacks the fame of other grand cathedrals in Europe and is overshadowed by the incomparable La Sagrada Familia. It is well worth a free visit as it is beautiful and historic. It was also nearly empty on a week day morning and quite",
          "My 2019 guidebook said I could check out the inside of the cathedral and that there would be traditional dancing (sardanes) outside the cathedral in the plaza at noon on Sundays. Sadly, I was greeted with a guard and a big \"no tourists\" sign. And no dancing.",
          "You can\u2019t miss this as you walk through the Gothic Quarter. Do yourself a favor and pay the money to go up to the roof. Wonderful view and benches to sit on. Even if you are afraid of heights, it is still very manageable.",

          "The first sight is awesome.... the grandeur of this cathedral leaves an impression for sure. However, we were put down a bit when we learnt that we have to pay to enter the Basilica. Well, can't say how prudent it is to ticket a basilica. As for the exterior, it is absolutely",
          "A lot of people go to Barcelona to visit the Basilica de la Sagrada Familia - but don\u00b4t forget to go back in history and visit this impressive building in the center of the city. There is so much art and so much history to be seen - you should go there twice ! I went there with",

          "An impactful church, altars to many saints and detail that is awe inspiring. You can donate at a chosen alter. There seemed to only be the option to pay to get in but it was worth it. We are spiritual but I think anyone would appreciate the sculpture and architecture.",

          "Visiting in November and after lunch, we were able to tour this beautiful Cathedral with no entry fee and without the crowds. A perfect time to come. However, so popular is Barcelona that, at other times, we might have experienced more difficulties so my advice would be to check",

          "Make sure you time your visit to avoid the queues, but in saying that it is free entry between 12 - 5.30pm. We went about 5pm and had no wait, as the queue moved quickly but once inside we did pay the extra 3E to take the lift to the rooftop, which was worth it. Great view.",
          "This cathedral has magnificent gothic arts. The gothic and baroque altarpieces is really awesome. The baptistery is a must see. The rooftop has gargoyles as well as domestic and mythical animals.This was constructed around the 13th century and is very well preserved.It is also",

          "The Barcelona Cathedral was absolutely breathtaking and mind boggling at the same time-the gothic details in every inch of this beautiful church is astonishing-how did they build these massive churches without modern day machinery?",
          "It's not one of Barcelona's \"top 10\" attractions, but that means you won't have to fight crowds inside. :-) I liked the interesting brick construction, especially the high vaulted ceiling; cool to see the old medieval paving stones in the cloister carved with different emblems.",

          "This cathedral has a very impressive design and architecture and is quite interesting. I visited it right after seeing Sagrada Familia where the guide said Gaudi designed the columns supporting the roof of the Sagrada Familia like branches of trees reaching up....well the design",
          "I do not think anyone should monetize viewing a Christian sanctuary or a church. Although, it is a very magnificent work of art",

          "A beautiful Cathedral that is free in the mornings! The highlight was the cloister. It's very beautiful and lots to see from the very old grave markers to the very live geese. Be sure to bring a cover up if you have shorts or bare arms. Worth a visit!",
          "We stopped here while in old town Barcelona. The only mistake we made was not pre booking entrance tickets. If you are going here in high season , do yourself a favor and purchase your tickets online . Please follow the dress code for the churches in Spain. We were",

          "Very beautiful place. The structure is gorgeous. A place that is absolutely spiritual. Also, very informative",
          "This beautiful cathedral is free (before 12:30 if I remember correctly.) We almost didn't go in because Rick Steve's guidebook said the dress code was strictly enforced. There were 4 of us and we were all in shorts. That ended up being ok.. The place is great inside and out.",

          "This church is worth a visit just to see the court yard. Inside is wonderful of course! So much history on show",
          "This is a must, to the point I take any friends who haven't been to the Cathedral. The audioguide is very good, the inside is impressive and very representative of the gothic style. You get to see the cloister, very well preserved, and recently they opened up visits to the roof,",

          "Definitely worth seeing! Even the alleys and the plaza are awesome. We totally enjoyed this more classic cathedral.",
          "Very nice church. We bought the ticket, it\u2019s toooo expensive. Suggestion, should be free of charge. So a lot more people want to come, no competition with Sagrada Familia",
          "I visited the cathedral while staying in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend it - it's a beautiful cathedral, with a rooftop walkway that offers great views across the city. The entry fee is a little steep at 7 euros but I think it's worth it. The cloistered area is",

          "Attended mass here...but didn't stay to the end. Stunning architecture and intricate designs. A walk through the Gothic quarters brought me here.",
          "We went to a Sunday mass, and it was beautiful. To listen to the Catalan language, looking at the nave of the church around you was wonderful. The church isn't as spectacular as some, but definitely worth a visit. If you are lucky, you will see the locals performing a Sardana",

          "My husband is a genealogist and Barcelona Cathedral is on his list to see as some ancestors worshipped there. We actually found their names on a wall in the cathedral so he was doubly excited. The chapels surrounding the nave are all beautiful. Admission includes a visit to",
          "This is a pleasant, typical, old Spanish cathedral that is worth a visit if you have time. You will not regret visiting; however it is not as memorable or historically important as other similar type of cathedrals in the country (such as Seville or Toledo). Modernista sites",

          "You must visit the cathedral to get a flavour of what makes a city; same here. And you must go in the morning when it is free! Don't be put off by the line to go in - security checks. A necessary evil nowadays. Beautiful building, lots of ornamentation and an interesting",
          "Actually visited June 2018. I love touring \u201cold\u201d cathedrals/basilica\u2019s. So well preserved. You are able to use a scarf of sorts to cover your exposed arms and or chest while visiting as many places have specific dress codes. The cathedral is still used for services.",
          "Wonderful views of the interior and exterior of the cathedral to enjoy - make sure that your camera battery is well charged. One can also go up the tower to overlook the city, but since we had just come back from doing that (we took the Tibidabo tram to the top of the hill",

          "It costs 7 euros per person to enter the cathedral. We thought that was a little bit steep, but the cathedral is very beautiful. If you wish to light a candle they charge a couple of more euros per candle. The courtyard is also beautiful.",
          "The cathedral situated in the gothic quarter us beautiful and a must see. The entry is free till 12:30 in the morning and from 5:45 in the evenings.. but if u want to access tower u pay some extra in the free time. The normal ticket are 7 euros",
          "I do not recall paying to enter but it was worth a short stroll inside and around the interior courtyard. I would say only 15 minutes are needed and the exterior and surrounding areas of the Gothic Quarter are awesome too.",
          "Love to visit the cathedrals! Unbelievable how they were built without machinery. The garden/fountain area was so pretty. Purchased a watercolor painting of the fountain area from a local 82 year-old artist as a great memory of our trip to Barcelona!",
          "Highly suggest to visit catedral on a Saturday afternoon/evening as part of the Barri Gothic visit. The cathedral is majestic from the exterior whilst various Catalonian groups perform the famous Catalonian Sardana dance on a Saturday evening around 6pm! We were also lucky to",

          "Stunning cathedral and worth visiting. I don't know about entry prices as we only had to pay for the lift to the roof which was 3\u20ac each. Stunning architecture and worth taking time to wander around looking at the items on display. There was a mass in progress during our visit",

          "Paid 7 Euros, no discount for seniors, to visit in the afternoon. This included the lift to the roof top. Great 360 degree view over Barcelona. I thought the cathedral was good but not as stunning as many I have seen for free in many countries.",
          "When people go to Barcelona, they think of the Sagrada Familia, but this Cathedral is lovely and free to enter. There was a sense of quiet in the place, and well worth a visit.",
          "This cathedral is about as centrally located as anything in Barcelona and is easy to combine with other nearby attractions. It has many historic features, and a beautiful palm-filled cloister with geese. If you are a fan of interesting old doors and wrought iron, there's",

          "The Barcelona Cathedral was at the end of the street so a quick visit would have been amis. Stunning building",
          "I went in the morning during the free entry period which I highly recommend. It is definitely worth the price to go in if you are unable to make it in the morning. Make sure you place this on your to do list as you make your way through the gothic quarter.",
          "Went in the morning during free entry period. Queued for a few minute but not too long. Visitor numbers carefully controlled and silence requested made helped maintain a magical atmosphere. Cloisters were a bonus to the visit. Recommended.",
          "The cathedral is closed in the morning for worship and prayer, but it is worth the \u20ac7 to go inside later in the day. The interior is very beautiful, but definitely take the lift up the tower, as it results in spectacular views over the city. Unusually, this cathedral also keeps",
          "I was able to take beautiful pictures from the rooftop of the church. We went a little after opening and it was already packed. It was raining slightly and that made people stay away from the rooftop which played into our favor.",
          "We arrived in the afternoon and had to queue to enter and pay 7 euros (no discounts for seniors). This ticket included the lift to the roof for spectacular views across the Barcelona to the sea beyond. They didn't seem to be enforcing the dress code as ladies were entering",
          "Like this church but others throughout town just as pretty and for free, long line, commercialized so took away from visit, did have great art and stained glass",
          "The Cathedral is set in a beautiful and busy square in the gothic quarter. But beware. If you have a nice watch do not stop for someone asking for a light for their cigarette. This happened to me and the street thief grabbed my arm and watch. I pulled out of his grip, and",

          "When we visited, entrance to the cathedral was free. We paid 3 euro for the lift ticket to the church rooftop, which I highly recommend as it offered lovely views of the city. This is a very pretty, gothic church with lots of altars to various saints to see and learn about.",

          "Just passed by the church. It has an amazing calming atmosphere regardless of the amount of people around it. Really nice",
          "It is well documented that the Sagrada is nearing completion in 2026 but do not let that stop you from visiting whenever you are in Barcelona. BUT do not Google any images of the interior, save that experience for your own eyes. Forget every other modern or Gothic cathedral that",
          "A must see. And spend some time to stroll along and study the details from the stain glasses to the sculptures and wall art.",
          "We were blessed to be able to attend Sunday Mass at the Cathedral. There was a fair in the esplanade and was quite noisy before we went in. No noise came through though. A very solemn Mass and excellent singer for the 7pm ceremony. On Monday, Mass was in Catalan but it was very",

          "Pay on the door but did not chose exhibition Peaceful and historic building. No audio guide. A good opportunity to pray, reflect or rest Highlight is a roof top walk with views of Barcelona",
          "The traditional architecture of this building is in striking contrast with the sagrada familia church. A wonder, however. Nicely kept, sonderful inside, central altarpiece, cloisters. Well worth a visit.",
          "A magnificent gothic cathedral at a very impressive size. Prepare yourself for a least one hour visit and do not miss the view from the rooftop and the magnificent garden.",
          "It might not have the fame or the wow factor of Sacrada Familia, but the Cathedral of Barcelona is very interesting in its own right. It retains a hushed sacred atmosphere with it\u2019s medieval layout and is still a daily place of worship with many masses in Spanish or Catalan",
          "This is lovely. You can get in free but you pay to go on the roof if you want to. It's a gorgeous cathedral. Lit up at night and tonight we came across a lady singing opera in the back streets. She was fantastic",
          "This cathedral is simply awe inspiring. Words are insufficient to describe its beauty. Take a walk inside and also venture to the outer grounds and see the white ducks that live on the grounds. If you are Catholic and speak Spanish, there was a line of open confessionals with",
          "Great place to visit, so historical and beautiful, what great architecture , great walking area around the place",

          "You pay to get in here - it is a rip off. Don't waste your time. Go see another church. Go across to Santa Maria del Mar as it is beautiful. This is a house of God - you should not pay!",

          "The Cathedral and the whole area called the Gothic Quarte is a must do when in Barcelona. Get lost in the narrow streets and shop a little and eat and drink. The Cathedral itself is exquisite and you will enjoy the architecture and Gothic style. Interesting fact\u2014this Cathedral",
          "There's certain times that the entrance is free but the queues were ridiculous so we returned later and paid the entrance fee and we were there with only a handful of other people so definitively worth the money.",
          "This cathedral is one of the most magnificent buildings amongst the sacred places of Europe ..a must-see in Barcelona !",
          "It cost 7 EUR to visit the cathedral and there are limited hours to enter. There is a lot to see. We spent at least 90 minutes inside visiting all the side chapels, the roof top and the cloister with beautiful fountains, trees and the 13 geese that they keep in remembrance of",
          "We stumbled upon this when wanting to visit the Gothic Quarter. It was a reasonable price to get into the cathedral, I think it was \u20ac8 each. The cathedral inside was beautiful, intricate, atmospheric it was real!! What I mean about this is other places of worships in the city",
          "This 13th-15th century cathedral is one of the most famous monuments in the Gothic Quarter, and can be attested to by the number of tourists that you will find waiting in front of it. Although similar to some cathedrals that I have been in, my most favourite part was when I took",
          "This cathedral is really lovely to walk around some of it dates back to 1298 with gothic architecture it was only \u20ac7 entry I'm so glad we decided to go in as you could quite easily spend a couple of hours looking around added bonus you can go to the roof and have a good view of",

          "The architecture of these very old cathedrals never fail to impress. Worth a visit and the relatively small entrance fee.",
          "Well it\u2019s not difficult to find in the gothic quarter. Stunning architecture in & out. Inside beautiful windows, lovely high alter all round the sides are alcoves of highly decorated Saints& ornaments. It\u2019s a Catholic Cathedral of course & this you can tell, by the saints",
          "Saw the Cathedral on our first day and wanted to go in. So we went back. Not being religious it is still worth a look. We paid to go in, however you can go in for free. It was amazing seeing the different designs around the inside of the cathedral. With the paid ticket you are",
          "This cathedral is beautiful. Very impressive. It is very obviously Gothic. It's towers are very similar to those of Burgos Cathedral. It's not at all hard to find, it's in the Barri Gotic. You can pay a small fee to visit the towers with views of the city.",
          "Such a lovely gem in the Gothic Quarter. Pay the 7 Euros to enter and enjoy the peace of the interiors along with an elevator ride to the rooftop where the views are stunning!",
          "An absolute must see. There are times of the day when you can enter for free you can find these by googling it.",
          "It's a fine cathedral. The interior is attractive and imposing, although not quite up to the Toledo or Chartres standard. The exterior is very impressive and well situated in the plaza so pictures come out great. A pleasant, intimate and charming cloister that comes with ducks.",
          "We visited late afternoon and it wasn't too busy, it was mid January, not the busiest of times. Situated in the Gothic area of the city its not too hard to find, there were quite a few beggars at the front door. Inside the church is beautiful, make sure you are appropriately",
          "I approached the entrance at 8.45 am wanting to be admitted to pray. The security turned me away. No matter how much I tried to explain in English \u201cWant to pray\u201d I was not allowed to enter. Told to come back at 2.00pm. I am very disappointed.",

          "Beautiful views, ancient stones, grand arches: this cathedral is as impressive and almost as old as Notre Dame de Paris. Definitely worth the fee to enter. The way it\u2019s lit at night is magical.",
          "if you need some relief from the wealth of Gaudii arhetecture this cathedral is a great antidote, built 500 years ago in the gothic stlye, it is full of both stained glass and various religious artwork.",
          "A really lovely place to visit for the religious artwork. Visitors must be respectful so must have shoulders covered and not too short a skirt or shorts (not an issue for us in winter) and you won't be able to see everywhere if a service is taking place. Entry is free but they",
          "It is one of the best cathedral we ever seen. Perfect cathedral, very clean and historical, full of art very suggestible.",
          "This is everything that you would expect from a Cathedral in a major City. The internal architecture is very good. The calming atmosphere is very good. The views from the roof are brilliant. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Beautiful cathedral and architecture. Could not go inside due to a private event but was still inspired. Gaudi museum was just next door.",
          "The cathedral is absolutely incredible, very ornate and fabulous views of the city from the rooftops. The glass panels are stunning and well worth a visit, suggest buying tickets on line before arriving.",
          "Awesome place. Such great architecture from the 15th century or earlier. Great place to just look around, sit somewhere and have coffee. Really great place",

          "We paid to go in and that included a trip by lift to the roof top. The cathedral was very tranquil and felt very calming after the bustle of the Christmas market outside. I didn\u2019t expect to stay for as long as we did, but my kids found a lot to see and spent time really",

          "Walked to Cathedral of Barcelona after visiting the Picasso Museum. Entry fee was \u20ac25 per person and can be paid at the door. The line to get into the church moves very fast so we did not buy tickets prior to our trip. Self-Guided Tour took approximately 45 minutes. Free to",

          "Amazing cathedral. Beauty in buckets, great layout, geese in the interior courtyard. Don't miss it. Looks like nothing from the outside, but do go in.",
          "Stunning inside the church. Never seen a church so big and beautiful. So amazing. Love it. Take the $3 to the tower. It's good to look from to bottom. Even in December it is crowded with tourist.",
          "Barcelona Cathedral is very beautiful church. Unfortunately I came here on January 1, so I couldn\u2019t enter inside and it made me disappointed. While holding Misa inside we can\u2019t enter.",
          "Next to the cathedral the hotel has it all. And accepts pets which is another plus. What could be improved: gym should be opened during the times announced and no cleaning while clients are trying to exercise. The bar close to the reception opens only at 9 am :( Rooms are",
          "\u20ac7 to go in, but a lovely cathedral. Also you can go to the roof for some sweet insta shots at sunset.",
          "As most all cathedral s in Europe they are worth seeing and are beyond beauty especially compared to USA. Great architecture.",
          "It has been renovated completely And there are many beautiful sculptures and also a great yard in middle",
          "We visited the Cathedral to attend mass for my birthday. The mass was held not on the main altar but on one of the pocket chapel. You cannot take photos in the chapel but if you\u2019re just there to visit and tour the Cathedral, they will allow you to take photographs.",
          "This Cathedral is worth viewing but it's not as good as many other European cathedrals I have visited. Make sure that you walk all the way around it to maximise your photo potential as it's narrow streets make it difficult to get excellent photos at times. Inside you can only",
          "After a disappointing visit to Barcelona, we decided to wait in line to see the Barcelona Cathedral, and am so glad we did! Was the highlight of our trip to Spain. For 7\u20ac per person, we got to see the interior of the building. For an additional 3\u20ac you can go to the roof for",
          "Nice gothic church in the historic part of Barcelona. A nice place to enjoy a mass or simply visit for its art and architecture",
          "My wife and I stayed right in front of the cathedral at Hotel Colon. Since it was so close, we put off visiting it until the end. After visiting Santa Maria Del Mar, a few scattered cathedrals nearby, and the two cathedrals in Girona, this one was our favorite. Highly",
          "totally worth seeing - it's free of charge daily before noon beautiful interior and great little gardens around makes this place somehow special",

          "One can\u2019t simply ovelook the imposing Gothic facade of the Barcelona Cathedral . We can see it vividly from the patio of our room at Hotel Colon . The inside architectural design of the Cathedral is also impressive . Was just intrigued by the presence of large geese as you",
          "Beautiful church in the square where we stayed. It is \u20ac7 to visit except there are certain times that accept just donations. It includes a visit to the roof though views are limited. You purchase candles at the front and light them in the outside courtyard where the geese are",
          "I would recommend this to people. It was scenic and my wife was particularly impressed.. Truth be told I'm writing this review because she loved it and I llost a bet to her!",
          "We visited in the height of summer so wasn't dressed as appropriately as we should've been (cover your knees and shoulders) - but they do provide scarves on the door free of charge for you to use and give back at the end or you can buy slightly prettier/less scratchy scarves on",
          "The Barcelona Cathedral is really pretty on the inside as well as the outside. The inside is gorgeous with beautiful paintings and pillars. The entrance fee also includes a small rooftop view. The Cathedral is huge and worth a visit if you have time while visiting Barcelona.",

          "The Barcelona Cathedral is a great place to visit. Typical gothic church with an outdoor area and a small exhibition. Many people though - there are worshippers and tourists in the church. Maybe a bit boring for teenagers.",
          "Visited here at 7.15pm at night and was still charged the \u20ac7 Euro entrance fee. I thought this was disgraceful especially since Mass was being held. I wasn\u2019t even given a guide brochure or explained anything about the inside. They just took my money and left me too it.. This",
          "the Barcelona Cathedral has similarities to many Gothic cathedrals except that here many chapels are outside the main building in the cloister. The cloister has other interesting features including some resident geese in the pond. Unfortunately many chapels have heavy bars in",

          "A lovely sunny winter day walking round the Xmas market in the shadow of this beautiful cathedral. Well worth a visit",
          "I\u2019ll recommend this for anyone visiting the Gothic quarter. It is quite an emotional environment as it is still a functional Church and you might see people worshipping in one of the Chapels. It\u2019s a place steeped in history and some mystery and quite extensive so you may not",
          "Not as crowded as the La Sagrada so you can really take your time and soak in the atmosphere. It is still a functional Church but my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit our only regret being that we hadn\u2019t planned enough time to view all the Saints grottoes as there are so",
          "Paid 7euros to enter in the afternoon which included a visit up the tower to enjoy the towers and views. The cloister had geese living there, making a noise which was also heard from the roof!",
          "It's a Cathedral. They are all amazing in architecture and wonder, but it's another cathedral. The more you visit Europe, you've seen one, you've seen them all. There isn't anything extra special about this one compared to others that are larger or have a more interesting",
          "The Barcelona cathedral often pales in comparison to the La Sagrada Familia, but it is well worth a visit. Located in the Gothic quarter of the city, it has a traditional Gothic interior. The choir stalls are stunning and covered with the coat of arms of the Order of the Golden",
          "A traditional Catholic Cathedral. High points of interest were the misericord carvings on the underside of the choir seats; and the cloisters, which had a life-size nativity and live geese! Also good to see the remains of the Roman Walls beside it. In December there was a nice",
          "While La Segrada Familia is probably better known and much, much bigger, this is the \u201creal\u201d Cathedral of Barcelona and the seat of the Archdiocese and Archbishop of Barcelona. And, this Cathedral is much, much older than La Segrada having been completed before 1450. While the",

          "As a student intrested in the history of Barcalona, it was a big dissapointment not too be let in the Cathedral by the guards. It feelt like the guards stood to make money out of the Cathedral, instead of showing it's greatness. A truly embarresment to the city.",

          "Didnt go inside as you have to pay for the entrance but from outside is beautiful. On the square in front of the entrance are always some atractive things going on like dancers singers acrobats",
          "Great place to visit! Online tickets are easy to get and go on your own time.",
          "Nestled away in the gothic quarter, has restaurants and cafes around. Be mindful of pickpockets",
          "Amazing building nothing else to say, you should definitely visit it when you are in Barcelona even if you are not fond of churches and other culture stuff. And go inside to check the interior. With a visit for sure.",
          "Beautiful architecture. Nothing more can be said than what has already been said. There is nearby parking (50 yards) in an underground garage. But, the garage is tight. We drove in with a full sized sedan and barely fit. But, it is extremely close to the cathedral. Beware in the garage, though. Our car was broken into.",
          "May be the most awe inspiring man made structure I've witnessed in person. The longer you spend the more you learn & the longer you stare the more detail you see. Do not take pictures of their no crossbow sign in security.",
          "The Cathedral of Barcelona is absolutely stunning!! In addition to it's magnificent architecture, the interior is decorated from floors (literally carved with names and very old dates e.g.1200's), to the ceiling. We spent almost two hours \u2026",
          "They wouldn\u2019t let us in as a group. We had to do like a ninja strategy where we split up and went in separate, this did not work. We then gave up and got drunk instead, great day",

          "Bittersweet that is such beautiful architecture, yet so commercialized for tourist profit. Sad tidings that tourists are not permitted to mass. Better to allow and prohibit all recording  devices and just let all with faith to share and rejoice.",
          "Very impressive building but disappointed the way they treat the tourists.  \n\nThey restricted the entry an hour before it says on their website and again the same in the evening.  \n\nIt would have been better if they mention correct visiting hours for the tourists.",
          "Just amazing but book online the day before otherwise it's virtually impossible",

          "The experience was decent, we were disappointed that we paid 14 euros and we were only able to see statues through the cages. I'm sure they had a good reason for this, it was not a very good experience to not be able to see statues fully \u2026",
          "Beautiful little gem to visit and one of the oldest uncovered land artifacts in Barcelona.  Highly recommend!",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the middle of the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. The entrance fee is a small nuisance but it's well worth it.

          "Please see this place.  I feel as though you can sense the history here.  The intricate art work and the majesty of the building speaks to the power of faith.  Honestly, we need more of this in America but I think the time is past for this \u2026",
          "Love the area around the cathedral very lovely lots of local street performers. The cathedral is beautiful from outside",

          "So amazingly beautiful. I guess it will always be under construction as it has been for years. The carvings and history most awe inspiring. The area is congested and surrounded by gypsies. Just be aware and wise.",

          "Great place ... realy wonderful.",
          "They don't make'm like that anymore. If you go to Barcelona, it's worth a few hours. The old City surrounding it is full of charming little eateries and cafes.  (Of course I have pictures but there's already a good selection online)",
          "Was exploring the gothic quartet, eating a crepe and ran into this beauty. It was around sunset so it was gorgeous to look at. The atmosphere was great and there were street performances in the square, so we sat on the cathedral steps and enjoyed the show.",
          "Wonderfully Gothic. We didn't fancy the queues to get into Sagrada Familia but knew the tourist bus would come around to the Barcelona Cathedral and opted to visit that instead. Beautiful Gothic grandeur. Very peaceful. We weren't disappointed with our choice.",
          "The most beautiful cathedral I never saw before.  When you visit Barcelona don't forget to visit it. Its amazing!!!",
          "Beautiful church.  Must take a look inside.  Don't miss the side patio.  If you go on Sunday (church not open to public) you'll see a band and dancers in the plaza.  Not professional dancers, just local people joining hands and doing some kind of dance.  Very fun to watch.",
          "The place is beautiful, the square in front of the cathedral is very living. Always have some kind of shows, musicians, artists of any kind, many people, beautiful cafes with good sangria and beer. The cathedral itself, in my oppinion, is \u2026",
          "Good place, but not the best of Barcelona. You can see it everywhere (for example the duomo of Monza in Italy is better then this)",

          "A beautiful cathedral with art that reinforces the evolution of Catalan art exhibited so well in the art museum. It must be said that it's function in the present day is that of a tourist attraction and spectacle as opposed to a place of worship. Expect queues to get in.",
          "This is a must visit in Barcelona. The gothic style interior and magnanimous exterior with wonderfully carved figures. The numerous chapels with wood carved altar pieces. The cathedral is sure to leave you awestruck with its beauty and galour.",
          "Crowded place outside, but a wonderful feeling when you get inside. You have to wait in line to get in but once you're passing the entrance you'll definitely feel it was worth it. \nIt's a must if you're exploring this part of the city.",

          "Great places to take some pictures, a lot of smalls streets where you will find a lot of history while you walk",
          "Beautiful, take the lift to the roof, the view is amazing.  Be respectful, this is a working cathedral not just  a tourist attraction, cover you shoulders when asked and don't wear really short shorts.  If you don't like being told to cover up, go elsewhere.",
          "That's one stunning-looking cathedral. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Magnificent in all its splendor! This place is completely captivating. I walked in and was torn between falling to my knees in prayer or capturing the jaw dropping artwork in photos to freeze the moment. Note to visitors please have your shoulders covered or you will be required to wear a shawl during your visit through the sanctuary.",

          "Amazing place.  So much culture and history.  Walk around and take it all in!",
          "7 Euros to enter is a rip off. The cathedral is nice, but not worth that much. Better churches to visit at cheaper price in France, Italy, Portugal... \n\nThe Audio guide is only useful if you want to waste 1h minimum listening to too much details. There should be a short version...",
          "It's one of the most beautiful part of Barcelona and one of my favourite place in the city anytime of the day or night is simply magic...but be also very careful pickpockets are very much in present and you should be careful of the hungry eyes!!!!",

          "The crunch and the medival surroundings are amazing. You really fell like you time traveled. Lose yourself in the surrounding streets, there is history everywhere you look. It's a pleasant walk from the church to La Rambla.",
          "The location and the locality is good...good number of shops around...best place to buy soveniers",
          "I wasn't impressed with this building. Very old and extremely well preserved cathedral - I'm surprised it survived so many wars and turbulent periods throughout history. However, I didn't experience a divine or holy feeling while inside, as \u2026",
          "Good example of a Gothic building architecture, but the day I went, some personnel were charging 8\u20ac or so for entrance when it's supposed to be free.",
          "Astonishing building! The architecture is very special in Barcelona. You can really get lost in all the beautiful buildings in this nice city.",
          "Nice and go to the roof. They spoiled the statues downstairs by putting bars in front of everything. They forgot that it is a church and not a prison. But it is a good experience nevertheless.",
          "Best from outside. Or try the roof.",
          "Absolutely beautiful! I\u2019d been planning to visit La Sagrada Familia, but that plan was interrupted. So, I visited the Cathedral of Barcelona with a friend. We got the audio guide and walked through the cathedral on our own. Lots of history and an overall great experience.",

          "My favourite building in the heart of Barcelona. It amazes me more than the Basilica of Sagrada Familia. Beautiful gothic architecture and even more so if you see the interior. Looks great during the day and more so when the night falls. Don\u2019t miss the geese at the courtyard",

          "It is so beautiful! I was lucky to get in during mass. You have to be very quiet, so that people can pray in peace. It is very annoying when people just barge in with no respect to other people and their beliefs. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The main hall was quite nice with intricate chaples on both sides. The Roof area, while having a nice view was more of a construction deck than a tourist area. The cloister was the great part of the cathedral with nice lighting and ducks.",
          "Must see but do buy the Head Out tickets to skip the lines as per Alcazar.\nGuide was brilliant and money well spent",

          "Beautiful monument but it's not worth it to enter into the cathedral",
          "Awesome gothic architecture with neo gothic front facade. Must see attraction when in town.",
          "Nice cathedral. And unlike the Secrada Fam\u00edlia it was actually finished",
          "Huge, mistic, historic and inspirational Cathedral. Gothic Architecture",
          "Very beautiful, you may feel the god energy around.",
          "Nice place to visit near Christmas. They opened a Christmas market here which is full of thing for your souvenir",
          "The cathedral is another Spanish church but found the markets in the square in front quite interesting there was a gentleman selling old printers blocks a fine gentleman and purchased a lot from him. Fantastic Barcelonian antiques. Cheers from Australia.",
          "Loooved every inch of the place. The courtyard with the birds was a nice touch. Would've loved some informative signs though. You can opt for an audioguide but it'll cost you more.",
          "Absolutely out of this world. Must see when visiting Barcelona",
          "Another one example of beautiful architecture in Barcelona. Worth to see",
          "7eur is a bit too expansive to visit. Looks nice from the outside though",
          "What a jewel. Wonderful detail. Unfortunantly  I didn't have time to tour through the inside. But from the outside areas you could travel around the entire structure.",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I have visited! The photos I have taken here are absolutely stunning. I would highly recommend going to this cathedral if you are visiting Barcelona!",
          "It's a wonderful Gaudi's work with a mystical atmosphere. But behaviour of some tourists inside made me sad. A russian speaking tourist was cleaning up his ears during the tour of the cathedral. It's not only him.It shouldn't happen. That's holy place.",
          "Go before 12pm to enjoy free entry everyday!",
          "So so beautiful. Really quite a spectacle of you are standing in front of it. I would recommend going early during the day in order to avoid large masses of tourist crowding your view.",
          "Ever in under-construction but the view from opposite side of lake is good",
          "What an absolutely stunning building to look at from the outside. I love looking at really old architecture, especially churches and cathedrals.",
          "In a relatively quiet spot of the city, one can take a little break.",
          "No other words than beautiful.  Just go.  Magnificent",
          "You must see it while staying in Barcelona. It is a main church of the city (not Sagrada Familia).",
          "Lovely square where you can have a drink & something to eat.You can also go on to the roof of the cathedral.",
          "Beautiful cathedral.  Lovely internal courtyard.  Lovely atmosphere in the square",
          "This picturesque cathedral has a beautiful facade and a fascinating history. I highly recommend this place for anyone who appreciates architecture.",
          "You must go if you want to see a Master Piece, Santa Eulalia 'la Merc\u00e8'  of Barcelona.",
          "Be sure to take the Rooftop walk, you won't be disappointed.",
          "Don't forget to get to the roof top. Excelent views of the city",
          "We didn't go inside but the exterior was very impressive. It is worth visiting the square by the main entrance, very impressive. There were several street entertainers and the atmosphere was great. Although we didn't go in, there wasn't \u2026",
          "Entry included access to the rooftop, great views. Also lovely courtyard",
          "There is so many places to go and see through all the little streets. Me and my mum love to explore. We really enjoyed it here",
          "Go before 12:30 and it's free! We probably would not have gone in otherwise (and wouldn't have felt like we missed out on much). The story behind the cathedral is really interesting, especially the building of the facade and why there are geese inside.",
          "It's really impressive, but the best thing of all is that the ticket includes elevator ride to the rooftop that provides some spectacular views of the Gothic quarter. Would recommend this to anyone.",
          "Only $7 to enter, line to visit roof very long. Recommend visiting early if you intend to walk skyline",
          "Beautiful historic cathedral in a vibrant square. Lots of energy and activity from tourists and local performers. The grounds were immaculately maintained.",
          "Nice place to explore when in Barcelona, quite representative of its \"Old\" Architecture pre Gaudi.",
          "Beautiful and wonderful cathedral, see it is best that a photo can show.",
          "Beautifull architecture. The lower rating is due to enormous number of tourists (Even in November) and the fact that the Cathedral closes quite early (today around 1530) when the capacity was full.",
          "Beautiful and photographical square, usually very crowded and full of street artists. Make sure to walk among the alleys near the church, there are a lot of statues, ancient gates and walls from the middle ages.",
          "Just across the cathedral is the rooftop of hotel colon with amaizing views",
          "Really beautiful architecture with so many small details on the walls and windows and doors. If you don't know anything about the place you can take free walking tours when you visit the city. Tour guides will take you to these gothic streets and explain everything about the history of the place.",
          "Absolutely grand cathedral, unlike the many churches or cathedrals in Europe. This is due to Gaudi. Gaud\u00ed's works have a highly individualized, one-of-a-kind style. Most are located in Barcelona, including his main work, the church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.",
          "Must see in Barcelona, plus I recommend to get lost in gothic area streets and enjoy discovering it's narrow cute and excentric streets.... Lots of beautiful historic arquitecture. Try to find EL PETRIXOL and order Xocolata amb xurros, sooo tasty!!!",
          "Simply gorgeous huge marvelous something you must see and not stop and miss",
          "The lift/elevator is broken. No access to roof. They still charge \u20ac7. Better ways to spend money.",
          "One of the most impressive cathedrals I have seen so far. I can highly recommend visiting it and would favor it over Sagrada Familia as is it much easier to get in and the fee is only half.",
          "Cute little church, super friendly congregation. They have a self serve setup for the offertory table so don\u2019t forget to throw in your communion wafer upon arrival!",
          "Great place to visit",
          "On a visit to Barcelona, its main Cathedral is one of the unavoidable places, which means that it is mobbed by a large number of tourists for most of the year. If you don't like to queue to visit the interior, you can still admire the Gothic facade and the medieval look of the buildings around the square.",
          "Amazing fresh seafood and a menu in English to help when our Spanish was weak.",
          "really worth to visit. it gives nice tour around cathedral and cloister. amazing view from top of cathedral.",
          "Great place for tourist around the Gothic Quarter. Recommended to visit the top view from cathedral for view of the city",
          "It is a nice cathedral, but it is just a usual one. You don't need to spend time for it.",
          "Best cathedral ever. Just stunning. For 7 euros you get to the towers on top and to see all these fantastic city views. Worth every cent!! Highly recommended",
          "Beautiful and breathtaking.  This modern construction deserves it's place in modern art and architecture. It's worth braving the crowds, street vendors, and pickpockets. And even more worth the ticket to go inside to see the vision up close.",
          "Very beautiful. In combination with a walk through G\u00f2tic district - very good. I thinks that this is must see if you like architecture and history.",
          "It is truly a remarkable place. We were fortunate enough to book a hotel just a couple hundred metres away. The Catedral itself takes you back in time, unlike the Gaudi inspired word which is only a century old.. The architecture is a \u2026",
          "It is a very beautiful structure...there is a sense of tranquility inside.\nHowever it would be nice if the authorities would exercise a strict dress code, as it is a place of worship more tgan just a tourist attraction.",
          "Nice Cathedral with very nice architecture. Worth a look if you're in the city centre!",
          "Historic church right in the old gothic section of Barcelona.",
          "Sublime medieval cathedral. Fully intact choir screen which is incredibly rare these days. Large adjacent cloister is also beautiful.",
          "Probably not worth the 7 euro admission (we forgot it is free in the morning and evening). Though it does include a lift to the roof, which is nice. If you've seen any major cathedral in Europe, this one is no different and probably less interesting.",
          "Nice to see from the outside, we didn't get s chance to go inside",
          "Iconic Barcelona. Worth viewing",
          "It was really good but you know I went at the late evening so I couldn't get to see like on day time but I like",
          "Its a beautiful Cathedral, make sure you bring appropriate clothing as you will not be allowed in if you show too much skin. if you forget you will be able to buy with street sellers nearby.",
          "One of the oldest buildings in the city, it's kind of the center of the gothic neighbourhood. It can be visited and tickets can be bought online. The cathedral is pretty big inside but quite beautiful. Via an elevator inside, you can get to the roof. The view there is beautiful.",
          "One of the oldest buildings in Barcelona. The line can become long and it may be closed on religious holidays so be sure to make a reservation before your arrival.",
          "It was amazing but I saw someone getting almost stolen at 3 am. :o",
          "A stunning building! We unfortunately couldn't go in as it was \"no tourists\" for palm Sunday. There was dancing and music outside the cathedral and it was such a wonderful experience. The detail of the building is extraordinary, and you can walk all the way around it via the side streets.",
          "It's very pretty I only saw it from the outside tho",
          "Excellent place. It's worth going the tour for cathedral church",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I've ever been in.  Free to enter and I almost spent more time in here than the Sagrada Familia.",
          "definitely worth visiting while in the Gothic quarter.",
          "It should be free.\nIt's religion, no business..  \nThe entrance was 7 euros",
          "This is a must stop as you start or end your tour of the Gothic quarter.  A beautiful church.",
          "A classic gothic style cathedral in the, surprise, Gothic Quarters. Has a very somber interior with many relics. Take the elevator to the roof top and you will see the most breathtaking view of downtown Barcelona! Entrance is free during \u2026",
          "Lovely Cathedral...... and it's FREE  on entrance,, but donation boxes scattered around... It takes about 50 minutes just strolling to get around this lovely building... Gift shop available, for all those souvenirs..",
          "Ornate,  incredible and varied detail inside.  Saw prayers by about ten priests for two women,  not sure of specifics but singing and repetitive speaking.  Amazing building",
          "Nice, but very busy. It doesn't worth the price.",
          "This Cathedral is beautiful and a must see in Barcelona.  It's also nice to relax in the square and listen to whichever guitarist is playing for the day, people watch, or just enjoy your gelato from the nearby gelato stand.",
          "This is a stunning cathedral in the centre of Barcelona. The views from the exterior are amazing as you stand on the street in the sun shine. It is easy to appreciate the magnitude of the architecture here.\n\nThe interior is equally \u2026",
          "It's very beautiful with lot of history so is the area there",
          "One of the Most Wonderful place in Barcelona. The Cathedral is very Marvellous.Its Beautiful from outside and inside. In summer Its Always Jam packed. Surrounded by some more amazing sites,Restaurants, tapas and Bars. Be Aware of \u2026",
          "Incredible place, don\u2019t come to barcelona without visit it",
          "Fabulous! Worth the ticket price and worth the visit. Please go and experience this church",
          "If you like gothic cathedrals and apses.",
          "Amazing cathedral!  Buy tickets on your smart phone and get audio guide too online.  I purchased tickets on my iPhone as we were in a cab driving towards the cathedral.  When we got there, there were zero people for online tickets line and \u2026",
          "Beautiful architecture! History very interesting.",
          "Amazing historical place to visit. I didn't go inside this time; although last yr. I did. Be prepared for a ton of tourists and street artists. The side alleys are super crowded and tight. Do NOT carry valuables, locals won't rob you ,but others might. But enjoy. The city is amazing.",
          "Great experience. Attended Christmas Eve Mass.",
          "7 euros to get in, 4 euros to get to the tower to see the view, 50 cents to use the toilet inside, 50 cents to turn on the lights to see the crypt... Not the best experience here in the city.",
          "Very Beautiful. And just people need to have certain dressing sense to enter this cathedral. There will be checking at the entry and few clothings will be provided by the security team at the entrance . But it's subject to availability.",
          "A pleasant experience.  Peace and serenity.",
          "What a lovely cathedral with the old City surrounding it and the actobatic soccer men...playing up to the crowd...they were delightfully performing for the crowd, and the Robles shopping district right near. I especially enjoyed the many \u2026",

          "Great architecture. A must visit when come to Barcelona.",
          "Love it. It is one of the most beautiful cathedrals with gothic style. \nThe only bad is that we visited during La Merc\u00e8 and it was extremely crowded and outside there was a \"concert\" in front of it.",
          "Amazing view, clean streets and total peace. Visit this place people!",
          "Towering above the center of the Barri G\u00f2tic district in Barcelona's principal cathedral. The Gothic cathedral's construction began in the late 13th century, though it wasn't completed until the mid-15th century. There are 140 statues of \u2026",

          "Amazing architecture, a perfect glimpse to Barcelona\u2019s medieval past, situated around the gothic quarter this place is a must visit, and don\u2019t forget to stroll around, you never know whet you stumble upon \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Extremely impressive both inside and out, well worth the \u20ac7 admission during peak hours. It has an elevator to the roof which offers incredible views across the whole of the city. A must see if you're visiting Barcelona.",
          "Very touristic but still lovely for the eye and if you love architecture and reusable materials well this is for you",
          "7 euros to look around. Amazing building. Lovely area to visit with street entertainment and lovely atmosphere",
          "It's mostly Gothic like many cathedrals in Europe dating back from the 13th century. It's the main seat of the bishop of Barcelona as is the norm of all cathedrals all over the world; the bishop of Rome for instance is the pontiff whose seat is at the cathedral of Rome or St. Peters Basilica.",
          "The cathedral is charming and inspiring. Built in the Gothic style with a monastery. Inside of cathedral you can see fountain and pond, where lives 13 gooses. Inside you can admire the organ and the whole Gothic style. The cathedral is beautiful from the inside and from outside. I recommend to visit, when you are in Barcelona.",
          "Take some minutes to appreciate the details, it's awesome",
          "Beautiful space. Would maybe rethink the audio tour though. Not the best money spent but the cathedral itself is a must",
          "Sadly we found out that we should have booked well in advance (months) before our visit as there were no tickets available on the day. A top tip- book online well in advance of any trip.we could only admire the fabulous architecture from outside",
          "Another cathedral..... pretty impressive though, a must see in Barcelona. interesting birds ....",
          "Although the entrance fee was a little high, I enjoyed the view, after going up with the elevator.",
          "Not as large as Sagrada but worthy of seeing. I loved walking through and seeing all the detail.",
          "I only saw from outside. If you leave visiting until mid day there are bug ques. Cost I think is around 7 euros.\n\nThe surrounding area is good if you find shade for some people watching.",

          "Beautiful. But is it open or closed? Even the people running the show dont know.",
          "To be honest, we came here because we thought it was necessary while we were in this city. We were not crazy about coming here , but we were completely wrong. Yes, the outside is crazy. It's all over the place. But it's very interesting. \u2026",
          "Beautiful architecture. Only open to the public during certain hours. A bustling tourist spot and local hang out.",
          "It's a beautiful place for take a picture. The Cathedral is located in one of the most Barcelona's touristic zone, next to Angel's walk. The church is bigger than others, has a wonderful history, its achitecture is so magic and romantic. \u2026",
          "I haven't had the opportunity to go inside of the Cathedral yet (when I do, I will make sure to update this review), however from outside it looks amazing at any time of the day and from any angle. I love its Gothic style. It is just \u2026",

          "Ok not as famous as the Gaudi masterpiece being built a mile away but the Cathedral de Seu is a gorgeous gothic sight to see itself from the imposing front on the square to the peace and quiet of the cloisters with the resident geese , well worth a couple of hours to explore",

          "Amazing, probably better than La Sagrada although the latest is a must see.",
          "This was so beautiful and the architecture is amazing. I had never been here before and we almost missed it. It is very close to a lot of parks and plazas so it seems very central. There are also a lot of little cafes nearby with places to eat.",
          "The oldest dated documents about the Barcelona's Cathedral foundation is from IV century although it wasn't consacrayed since 1339, which is XIV century. So 10 centuries later. How come? It's all written in the Cathedral archive that you can also visit.",

          "A piece of art, it looks even better when you\u2019re there. There are a few hobo\u2019s and people who try to sell you stuff which is irritating, but you\u2019ll find that everywhere around the city so why let that stop you from seeing this cathedral. For sure a recommendation.",

        "wiki": "The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Catalan pronunciation: [mu\u02c8z\u025bw n\u0259si.u\u02c8nal \u02c8da\u027ed d\u0259 k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8lu\u0272\u0259], English: \"National Art Museum of Catalonia\"), abbreviated as MNAC, is the national museum of Catalan visual art located in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Situated on Montju\u00efc hill at the end of Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, near Pl Espanya, the museum is especially notable for its outstanding collection of romanesque church paintings,  and for Catalan art and design from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including modernisme and noucentisme. The museum is housed in the Palau Nacional, a huge, Italian-style building dating to 1929. The Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a national museum in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. That same year, a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of this institution dates back to the 19th century, when, in accordance with the principles that inspired Catalonia's cultural and political Renaixen\u00e7a (renaissance), a movement particularly active in that century, many projects were launched to help revive and conserve the country's artistic heritage. This process began with the establishment of the Museu d'Antiguitats de Barcelona (Barcelona Museum of Antiquities) in the Chapel of St Agatha (1880) and the Museu Municipal de Belles Arts (Municipal Fine Art Museum) in the Palau de Belles Arts (1891), a palace built to mark the occasion of the 1888 Universal Exhibition. A project to install all these Catalan art collections in the Palau Nacional, launched in 1934 under the initiative of Joaquim Folch i Torres, the first director of Catalonia Museum of Art, was frustrated by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), when for protection many works were transferred to Olot, Darnius and Paris (where an important exhibit was established). During the postwar period, the 19th- and 20th-century collections were installed in the Museu d'Art Modern, housed from 1945 to 2004 in the Arsenal building in Barcelona's Parc de la Ciutadella, whilst the Romanesque, Gothic and baroque collections were installed in the Palau in 1942.\nThe Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a national museum in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. In 1992 a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004.\nSince 2004, the Palau Nacional has once more housed several magnificent art collections, mostly by Catalan art, but also Spanish and European art. The works from that first museum have now been enriched by new purchases and donations, tracing the country's art history from early medieval times to the mid-20th century: from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and baroque to modern art. This heritage is completed by the Gabinet Numism\u00e0tic de Catalunya (coin and medal collections), the Gabinet de Dibuixos i Gravats (drawings and engravings) and the library.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque Art ===\n\nIt is one of the most important and outstanding collections in the museum, due largely to the series of mural paintings it includes. Indeed, the Museu Nacional Romanesque Collection is unmatched by that of any other museum in the world. Many of the works here originally adorned rural churches in the Pyrenees and other sites in Old Catalonia, or Catalunya Vella, as it is known; they began to be discovered and studied in the early 20th century, particularly after a Pyrenean expedition in 1907 by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (Institute of Catalan Studies), which later published Les pintures murals catalanes (Catalan Mural Paintings). Years later, the news emerged that a group of foreign financiers and antiquarians had block-purchased most of these paintings to be taken to the United States of America. Although there were no laws in Spain at that time to forbid the expatriation of art, the Junta de Museus (Catalan Board of Museums) was able to successfully intervene in order to rescue, dismantle and transfer works to the Museum of Barcelona (1919\u20131923), then housed in the Parc de la Ciutadella, thus conserving and protecting these Romanesque works, considered a completely unique piece of art heritage and also a symbol of the birth and formation of Catalonia.The Romanesque rooms are arranged in chronological and stylistic order, giving visitors a view of the different tendencies in Catalan Romanesque art and featuring works produced, for the most part, in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\nThe visit to this section begins with the mural paintings from Sant Joan in Bo\u00ed, which show clear stylistic influences from the French Carolingian tradition, and then continues with works showing the Italian influence that dominated painting from the late 11th century, doubtless as a result of the influence of the Gregorian Reform. This style is illustrated in such excellent works as the mural paintings from Sant Quirze de Pedret, Santa Maria d'\u00c0neu and Sant Pere del Burgal.\nHowever, the rooms of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also feature a particularly outstanding example of European Romanesque art: the remarkable, original and extraordinarily expressive paintings from the Apse of Sant Climent de Ta\u00fcll, including the famous Pantocrator or Christ in Majesty, an undisputed masterpiece from the 12th century that forms tangible evidence of the creative power of Catalan painting. Beside this superb piece stands another magnificent group of works, from Santa Maria de Ta\u00fcll, the most important example of the interior of a Romanesque church painted throughout, with much of its decoration conserved today.\nThe Romanesque section ends with the paintings from San Pedro de Arlanza and the chapter house of Sigena. The latter features one of the most magnificent pictorial series in this new style, called 1200 art, which swept across Europe in the 13th century. The piece has been conserved in the museum since it was severely damaged by fire in 1936, during the Spanish Civil War.Romanesque rooms also show the techniques that distinguished Catalan art at the time, such as panel painting, wood carving and others that help to complete our aesthetic vision of Romanesque, such as precious metalwork and carving stone.\nThe collection of panel paintings, unique in Europe, is another singular aspect of Romanesque painting, due both to the number and antiquity of the Catalan works conserved (the result of interest in the Romanesque since the late19th century) and to their quality and technical diversity. Particularly outstanding are the frontals of the Apostles (also known as the Frontal of La Seu d'Urgell), Al\u00f2s d'Isil, Avi\u00e0 and Cardet, which are rightly considered paradigms of an original pictorial technique, embodying enormous artistic interest. Moreover, the wood carving collection completes this wide-ranging summary of Romanesque art, featuring fine works of different types, such as Virgin of Ger, the Batll\u00f3 Majesty and the carvings in the Erill la Vall Descent from the Cross.\nThere are also sculptures in stone that form part of the Museu Nacional Romanesque art collection, particularly a number of works from Ripoll and a large group of elements from ensembles in the city of Barcelona, including the refined marble capitals from the former Hospital de Sant Nicolau. Finally, the Romanesque section also features an important collection of enamels, mostly produced in Limoges, such as the Mondo\u00f1edo Crosier.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gothic Art Collection ===\n\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Gothic art collection began to take shape in the early decades of the 19th century, when a movement was first launched to revive and conserve the important body of Catalan heritage, which had been seriously damaged in the wave of convent burnings that took place at around the time of the disentailment of church goods in the year 1835.\nThe Gothic collection features a considerable number of Catalan works accompanied, moreover, by an extraordinary selection of pieces from the other territories that were once ruled by the Crown of Aragon. As a whole, this section presents a broad, representative panoramic view of Gothic art produced in the three large peninsular territories that formed part of the kingdom of Aragon \u2013 Catalonia, Aragon itself, and Valencia \u2013 as well as a more anecdotal selection of works from Majorca.\nThe Gothic rooms display works from the late 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, arranged in chronological order, although the pieces are also grouped by school and typological affinity, and several thematic sections have been established. These include the renowned Mural paintings of the Conquest of Majorca, which preside over the first Gothic room. This same room also contains other works on profane themes or from secular sites, including elements from the enteixinats (coffered ceilings) of noble Barcelona houses to amatory caskets.\nOther works in this and the following rooms, from Castile, Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia, clearly illustrate the predominance of French Gothic models, which endured until the mid-14th century, when competition was finally offered by new Italianate models. This new style, developed in the Italy of Giotto, was adopted and adapted here, working a profound transformation in painting and sculpture not only in Catalonia, but throughout the reigns forming part of the Crown of Aragon.\nBesides a few Italian examples, the Museu Nacional also features an important selection of Italian, Catalan and Aragonese painting, such as the Triptych of Sant Vicen\u00e7 d'Estopany\u00e0, probably by an immigrant Italian artist, and altarpieces by the Serra brothers (the Serra family were highly influential in steering the course of Catalan painting during the closing decades of the 14th century). Sculpture during this period from the mid-14th century, was also influenced by Italian models, although the French Gothic style continued to exercise its authority. The collection includes works that may be attributed to some of the most outstanding sculptors of the time, such as Jaume Cascalls (see Head of Christ) and Bartomeu de Robi\u00f3. Catalan sculpture in the late 14th century and the first half of the 15th is represented by two misericords from Barcelona Cathedral carved stalls by Pere Sanglada. From the 15th century, working in the new International Gothic style, Pere Oller and Pere Joan perhaps represent the peak of what was without doubt an important Catalan contribution to sculptural art.\nAmongst Catalan painters, Llu\u00eds Borrass\u00e0, Joan Mates, Bernat Martorell, Ramon de Mur and Joan Antig\u00f3 are amongst the finest exponents of International Gothic, a style that also coincided with the period when Valencia was flourishing as a centre for art. Valencia is represented in the Museu Nacional by such outstanding artists as Gon\u00e7al Peris. The Gothic collection also features examples of painting from Aragon, another region that enjoyed considerable influence at this time. The exchange of influences continued, in both directions, during the period that followed when artistic representation became more realistic, and which took its initial inspiration from Jan van Eyck: the Valencian artist Llu\u00eds Dalmau painted the universally acclaimed Virgin of the Consellers whilst the Catalan Joan Reixac \u2013 whose work is well represented at the Museu Nacional \u2013 directed the most prolific workshop in Valencia. It was also after a period in Valencia that Jaume Huguet, the great Catalan painter working in the second half of the 15th century, made his residence definitively in Barcelona, establishing his dominance and setting up a school there. Complementing a generous selection of Huguet's works, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also contains examples from artists active during the same period, such as Pere Garcia de Benabarre, who worked in both Aragon and Catalonia and created another successful formula based on similar cultural components.\nBesides this central strain in autochthonous painting, the panorama of Gothic art also features various other important episodes, such as the time spent by Antoine de Lonhy in Barcelona, or the later, longer residence in the Catalan capital of the Cordoban artist Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo, who had previously worked in Valencia and Aragon. This journey through the late 15th century continues with such Castilian painters as Fernando Gallego, along with others from Aragon, as Mart\u00edn Bernat or Miguel Xim\u00e9nez, and Valencia, principally Roderic d'Osona. Finally, mention the remarkable series of the organ shutters from the Cathedral of la Seu d'Urgell, painted at the end of the 20th century by an artist from Perpignan who is known by various names, including that of the Master of La Seu d'Urgell.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Renaissance and Baroque Art Collection ===\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Renaissance and baroque art collection comprises pieces of priceless cultural heritage that \u2013 unlike the collections at other great national museums in Europe, which were generally built up from royal and aristocratic collections \u2013 was established in Catalonia through the acquisition of local pieces and later complemented by donations and acquisitions from private galleries.\nThe itinerary begins with art from the Low Countries in the 16th century, in which religious fervour is mixed with detailed depiction of everyday life, as can be seen in the superb collection of panels and triptychs commissioned for private use. In Catalonia during the early Renaissance period, the Gothic forms are found alongside other, new stylistic solutions, as exemplified, for instance, in St Candidus, by Ayne Bru or St Blaise, by Pere Fern\u00e1ndez, works imbued with the humanist feeling and influenced by the modern composition theories that were then emerging in Italy. In the Altarpiece of St Eligius of the Silversmiths, Pere Nunyes clearly shows the influence of this new language, as does the sculptor Dami\u00e0 Forment in his interpretation of the Apostles for the Dormition of the Virgin. Towards the end of the 16th century, Spanish painting produced many works of outstanding beauty, such as El Greco's The Bearing of the Cross and St Peter and St Paul, enriched by modern use of colour, the fruit of the lessons the artist had learned in Venice. In this age, the Ecce Homo, Luis de Morales, a contemporary of El Greco, Jacopo Tintoretto or The Bassano, masterfully conveyed the devotional spirit of the Counter-Reformation.\nThe 17th century begins with the frescoes in the Herrera Chapel by Annibale Carracci and collaborators, who decorated the Church of San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli in Rome, and continues with works by other Italian artists such as the Neapolitans Massimo Stanzione and Andrea Vaccaro. However, standing out above all these are the masterpieces from the masters of the Spanish Golden Age, such as the Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew by Jos\u00e9 de Ribera, known as Lo Spagnoletto, St Paul, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, and the Immaculate Conception and several still lifes by Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n. Returning to Catalonia, in his image of St Cajetan, the sculptor Andreu Sala reveals himself to be a worthy follower of the Italian genius Bernini.\nEntering now the 18th century, Antoni Viladomat's series of canvases devoted to the Life of St Francis, which decorated the main cloister of the former monastery of the Friars Minor in Barcelona, constitutes the only complete set of scenes from monastic life preserved in a museum. Finally, heralding the art forms that would develop in the 19th century, the daring works of Francesc Pla, known as El Vigat\u00e0, illustrate the painterly freedom taken when decorating the interiors of seigniorial mansions belonging to the new, wealthy classes who had made their fortunes in trade and industry.\nThe collection, which reflects the taste of certain sections of society for Renaissance and Baroque art, features (exceptionally, if compared to the rest of the Museu Nacional collections) art produced not only in Catalonia, but also in the rest of Spain, Italy and Flanders, providing an overview of the development of European art during this period. Two later donations made important contributions to this more general vision: the Camb\u00f3 Bequest and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== The Camb\u00f3 Bequest ====\nThe collection of paintings that the Catalan politician and arts patron Francesc Camb\u00f3 (1876\u20131947) built up with the intention of donating works by the great masters to complement the great medieval series in the Museu d'Art de Catalunya as it was then known, is the most valuable altruistic donation that the Museu Nacional has received in its history, and the one which has most served to enrich the body of Renaissance and Baroque works here.\nThe Camb\u00f3 Bequest forms a collection of paintings embraces European painting history from the 14th to the early 20th century. It includes representative works of the Gothic and Renaissance periods, together with pieces that illustrate the perfection of the Italian Quattrocento, the sensuality of the great Venetian masters of the Cinquecento, the rising economic prosperity of the Low Countries in the 16th and 17th centuries and the magnificence of the Spanish Golden Age, without forgetting the richness of European Rococo. The artists represented at the Museu Nacional, thanks to this distinguished collection, include many outstanding, universally known names: great Italian painters such as Sebastiano dal Piombo, Tiziano Vecellio (Titian) and Giandomenico Tiepolo; superb exponents of the Flemish School in the form of Peter Paul Rubens and Lucas Cranach; Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and Maurice Quentin de la Tour and their French rococo works; and, finally, Francisco de Goya, whose revolutionary genius rounds off the artistic journey embraced by the Camb\u00f3 Bequest.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Thyssen Bornemisza Collection ====\nWhen the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection was installed in the Palacio de Villahermosa in Madrid, and the state formalised the purchase in 1993, a number of the works \u2013 72 paintings and 8 sculptures, mainly on religious themes, though also including several landscapes and portraits \u2013 were dispatched on permanent loan to Barcelona. In that same year, 1993, the permanent exhibition of these works was officially opened in a wing of Pedralbes Monastery, converted into a museum by Barcelona City Council. In 2004, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya reached an agreement under which the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Barcelona was to be exhibited permanently at the Museu Nacional, with the dual purpose of complementing the content in the Catalan museum and making the works more widely known and appreciated.\nThe collection comprises paintings and sculptures spanning European art from the Gothic to the rococo period. There are many Italian works, including, most outstandingly, paintings by Fra Angelico, Pietro da Rimini, Taddeo Gaddi, Francesco del Cossa, Bernardino Butinone, Dosso Dossi, Titian, Ludovico Carracci, Tiepolo and Canaletto, among others. Particularly fine examples from the Flemish school are a painting by Petrus Paulus Rubens and a landscape by Salomon Jacobz van Ruysdael, whilst the Spanish Golden Age is represented by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Portrait of Mariana of Austria.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Art Collection ===\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya modern art collection owes its origins to the 1888 Universal Exhibition, when Barcelona City Council installed what was then a modest collection of  contemporary (for the time) modern art in the Palau de Belles Arts. This original core of the collection was considerably expanded by acquisitions made by the Council at art exhibitions. As it stands at present, the modern art collection contains a selection of the finest Catalan art from the early 19th century until the 1940s.\nThe first part of this itinerary is devoted to the neoclassical, Romantic and realist movements. Among the most outstanding Catalan neoclassical artists represented here are the painter Josep Bernat Flaugier and the sculptor Dami\u00e0 Campeny. In terms of Romanticism, particular mention should be made of Nazarene painters such as Claudi Lorenzale, who focussed on the portrait most notably, and Llu\u00eds Rigalt, a precursor of the Catalan landscape tradition, which was continued (now entering the Realist period) by Ramon Mart\u00ed Alsina, who introduced Courbet's ideas in Catalonia, and Joaquim Vayreda, founder of the Olot School, among others. Special mention should also be made of Mari\u00e0 Fortuny, Catalonia's finest 19th-century painter. Fortuny's genre painting won him international acclaim, although towards the end of his short life he became interested in pictorial innovation, as can be seen in his last works. Also represented here are several painters who worked in the style of anecdotal realism, including Rom\u00e0 Ribera and Francesc Masriera, and the Luminists of the Sitges School, disciples of Fortuny. Turning now to sculpture, the Vallmitjana brothers are the most outstanding exponents of the realist tradition. Finally, the section devoted to the 19th century also includes examples from early photographic art, featuring works by A. A. Disd\u00e9ri, Jean Laurent, Le Jeune and Charles Clifford, among others, featuring images of different places from all over Spanish territory.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nModernisme is a movement of enormous artistic and cultural importance in Catalonia, is one of the central themes in the Museu Nacional modern art collection. In painting, the works most clearly identified with this movement, infused with a spirit of renewal, are those by Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, whose Parisian paintings embrace certain elements from French Impressionism. Another important trend is Symbolism, represented here by the paintings of Alexandre de Riquer and Joan Brull, and also seen in certain photographs by the pictorialist Pere Casas Abarca. The second generation of Modernista artists are present in depth and number, too, with works by the likes of Isidre Nonell, Mari\u00e0 Pidelaserra, Ricard Canals, Hermen Anglada\u2013Camarasa, Nicolau Raurich and Joaquim Mir, among others. It was these and other artists who helped to elevate Catalan painting to reach one of its most brilliant periods around the turn of the 20th century. The collection also includes works by Spanish painters, such as Julio Romero de Torres, Joaquim Sorolla, Ignacio Zuloaga, Dar\u00edo de Regoyos and Jos\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez Solana, the photographer Ortiz-Echag\u00fce and the French artists Boudin, Sisley and Rodin. Particularly interesting in the section devoted to Modernista sculpture are the works of Miquel Blay and Josep Llimona, who were clearly influenced by Rodin. The collection of Modernista decorative arts includes some exceptional examples of interior decorative art by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Gaspar Homar and Antoni Gaud\u00ed from, respectively, the Amatller, Lle\u00f3 Morera and Batll\u00f3 houses in Barcelona's Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia; objets d'art in various specialities, such as ironwork, ceramics, glasswork and jewellery; not forgetting several items of furniture by Joan Busquets and the architect Josep Maria Jujol.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe second movement richly represented in the Museu Nacional modern art collection is Noucentisme, which embodies the quest for the essential spirit of the Mediterranean. The movement is represented by the classical compositions of Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda and Joaquim Sunyer, vaguely influenced by C\u00e9zanne, and the sculptural nudes of Josep Clar\u00e0 and Enric Casanovas. Completing this review of Noucentisme are the sculptures by Manolo Hugu\u00e9 and the paintings by Xavier Nogu\u00e9s, notably popular in tone. In around 1920, a new generation of artists emerged, one faced by the dilemma of either continuing in the figurative tradition or making the leap to the avant-garde. Some of these, such as the painters Josep de Togores and Francesc Domingo, produced work with a style of its own within the context of international realism, a movement that gained many followers between the wars. Others, such as Torres-Garc\u00eda himself, Rafael Barradas and Salvador Dal\u00ed, found in the Galeries Dalmau the ideal gallery at which to show their more innovative works.\nThe historic avant-garde is very well represented, particularly in terms of sculpture, with works including impressive sculptures by Pablo Gargallo, Julio Gonz\u00e1lez and Leandre Crist\u00f2fol, whilst in painting the most exceptional figure is Pablo Picasso, represented in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collection since 2007.\nTurning now to the field of photography, we should mention such avant-garde artists as Josep Masana, Josep Batlles, Pere Catal\u00e0 Pic and Emili Godes, as well as Agust\u00ed Centelles for his important graphic work documenting the Spanish Civil War. Finally, the new avant-garde that emerged during the post-war years is represented by Otho Lloyd and Joaquim Gomis, whose pioneering work found its continuation in the Neorealists Francesc Catal\u00e0-Roca, Joan Colom, Oriol Maspons and Xavier Miserachs, among others.\n\n\n==== The Carmen Thyssen Bornemisza Collection ====\nIn late 2004, to mark the opening of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the museum received a score of Catalan art works from the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza collection. In view of the wealth and heterogeneity of this collection, the works loaned to the Museu Nacional focus more on diversity than on unity of discourse, with the object of giving an idea, if overly concise, of the plurality of this collection.\nThe chronological period covered by this section spans from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, one of the most brilliant moments in the history of Catalan art. Notable amongst the 19th-century pieces is Mari\u00e0 Fortuny's Bullfight, Wounded Picador, painted in 1867. As regards the Modernista movement, several of the most important artists from this period are represented, featuring Open-Air Interior (1892) and Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem (1897), both by Ramon Casas; Le Paon Blanc by Hermen Anglada-Camarasa; and The Cathedral of the Poor (in which the Church of the Sagrada Familia, under construction, is seen in the background) and The Abyss. Majorca (1901\u20131904) by Joaquim Mir. Equally noteworthy is the presence of Noucentisme, a movement deeply rooted in Catalonia, with paintings by Joaquim Torres-Garc\u00eda and Joaquim Sunyer, as well as works by younger artists who continued the Noucentista spirit. Finally, this journey through the history of Catalan modern art leads to the acclaimed Antoni T\u00e0pies.\n\n\n==== Cabinet of Drawings and Prints ====\nThe collections assembled from the museum's historic holdings to form the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Cabinet of Drawings and Prints comprise some 50,000 drawings, 70,000 engravings and more than 1,000 posters. The founds combine to offer a rich and wide-ranging journey through the most important movements in the history of Catalan art, particularly since the late 18th century, thanks largely to the establishment in Barcelona in 1775 of the Free School of Design and the Fine Arts. Popularly known as La Llotja, this school quickly became a reference point in the consolidation of the academic style in Catalonia. Representing the period from Neoclassicism to Realism, the Museu Nacional collections of works on paper feature a considerable number of pieces by artists linked to the school in the 19th century, including Josep Bernat Flaugier, Vicent Rod\u00e9s, Claudi Lorenzale and Ramon Mart\u00ed Alsina, as well as others by members of certain families, such as the Planella and the Rigalt lineages, who produced various generations of artists. From the preceding periods, we should highlight in particular the contribution made by the most outstanding Catalan baroque painter, Antoni Viladomat, who is represented by many works in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. As recently as 2003, moreover, the collection was enhanced by the acquisition of a group of Catalan baroque altar works from C\u00e9sar Martinell's unique collection, which provide an interesting view of Catalan altarpiece art in the 17th and 18th centuries.       \nHowever, there can be no doubt that one of the true highlights of these collections is the important body of works by Mari\u00e0 Fortuny, which include more than 1,500 drawings and 50 engravings, making the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints an essential reference for reconstructing the creative trajectory of this great 19th-century artist. From the same period, moreover, are more than 30 drawings by the history painter Eduardo Rosales, acquired in 1912, and linked to two of his finest and most characteristic historic compositions: The Testament of Queen Isabella the Catholic and the Death of Lucrecia.\nThe Modernista and noucentista movements are also widely represented in the Cabinet holdings. The collections include more than 600 Modernista posters by renowned Catalan and foreign artists. Among the most impressive are those by Ramon Casas, one of the most illustrious of all Modernista artists. Particularly mention should be made of the famous series of charcoal sketches, a veritable portrait gallery of the leading personalities of the era in Catalonia, and which Casas himself donated to the museum in 1909. Turning now to the noucentista movement, we should draw attention in particular to Isidre Nonell, represented in the Cabinet by some 150 pieces.\nNor should we forget the collection of posters from the same period, largely acquired by the museum from Llu\u00eds Plandiura in 1903. Comprising more than 500 pieces among which foreign artists are also well represented, this invaluable legacy constitutes an incomparable resource for tracing the history of poster art in Catalonia.\nFinally, though the collection is rather uneven here, mention should be made of the printed works from the avant-garde movement. The sculptor Juli Gonz\u00e1lez is one of the avant-garde artists most amply represented in the Cabinet, thanks to the donation of more than 150 drawings made by his daughter in 1972. On the other hand, the presence of certain great contemporary creative artists such as Dal\u00ed and Mir\u00f3, to mention but two, is little more than anecdotal.\nTwo acquisitions made by the old Museums Board were fundamental to forming the collections contained in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. The first was the collection of literary and art critic Raimon Casellas, in 1911; the second, that of Modernista artist Alexandre de Riquer, ten years later.\n\n\n==== Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia ====\nThe collections of the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, established in 1932, now comprises more than 134,000 pieces. This rich holding is the result of a long process of acquisition by purchase, donation, legacy or deposit, which began in the first half of the 19th century and continues even today.\nThe coin collection comprises nearly 100,000 pieces, including examples from the main series minted from the 6th century BC to the present. The most important and interesting amongst these are, without doubt, the coins produced in Catalonia, which include many extremely rare and unique pieces. The visit to the Numismatic Cabinet begins with the series of ancient coinage, outstanding among which are those minted on the Iberian Peninsula. These include such important pieces as the coins from the Greek colonies of Emporion and Rhode and the treasure of 897 silver pieces found at the neapolis of Emporion. Dating back to the transition period between the ancient and medieval worlds is the collection of Visigoth coins, including some minted at workshops in Catalan territory, such as Barcino, Tarraco or Gerunda. Practically all the western European kingdoms are represented in the medieval Christian series, although the collections of coins from Catalonia and Aragon are the most notable. They include examples that illustrate, step by step, the historic and economic evolution of these lands. For example, the economic growth that Catalonia enjoyed in the 13th century is reflected in the minting in Barcelona for the first time of silver Peter II Croats. Finally, among the coins minted in the modern and contemporary periods, we should mention particularly those produced in Catalonia during three important historic periods: the Reapers War, the War of the Spanish Succession and the French occupation.\nThe medals collection is formed by more than 9,000 pieces, which range from the earliest, struck in Italy in the second half of the 15th century, to the present. The greater part of this collection is made up of works produced in Spain, mostly by well-known artists and engravers, who created medals of the highest quality. For example, the Museu Nacional medals collection features works by such outstanding 18th-century master engravers as Tom\u00e1s Francisco Prieto and Ger\u00f3nimo Antonio Gil. During the late 19th century, moreover, particularly after the 1888 Barcelona Exhibition, many Modernista sculptors turned to the art of medal-making, and the examples in the Cabinet fully reflect what was a splendid creative period for the genre, particularly in Catalonia. The leading artist in the field was, without doubt, Eusebi Arnau, but such sculptors as Parera, Blay, Llimona and Gargallo also created medals of the highest quality.\nThe central core of the MNC paper money collection, which embraces a wide range of documents of different types, is formed by its 4,100 examples of banknotes. These include the Spanish series containing all the banknotes issued by the Bank of Spain from 1874 to the present, as well as the series of paper money printed by the Catalan Government and local authorities in the country during the Spanish Civil War.\nThe Cabinet also exhibits a range of different pieces of interest due to their direct or indirect connection with numismatics. These include, amongst other things, tools used for minting coin, coin weights, scales, jettons (counters), pellofes and other types of tokens, stamps, medals and various documentary collections.\n\n\n== The building ==\n\nThe National Palau of Montju\u00efc, known as Palau Nacional was constructed between 1926 and 1929, with the goal of being the main building of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, holding an Exhibition of Spanish Art named El Arte en Espa\u00f1a (The Art of Spain). More than 5,000 works came to the Exhibition from across Spain.\nThe Palau Nacional is a huge building (over 50,000 square metres (540,000 sq ft)) which embodies the academic classical style that predominated in constructions for all the universal exhibitions of the period. Its fa\u00e7ade is crowned by a great dome inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City in Rome, flanked by two smaller domes, while four towers modelled on Santiago de Compostela Cathedral stand at the corners of the so-called Sala Oval, or Oval Hall. This great space (2,300 m2), used as the venue for important civic and cultural events, is encircled by tiered seating, preceded by double columns; it also houses a monumental organ, one of the biggest in Europe, waiting for an important restoration work. Many of the most outstanding painters and sculptors of the day, for the most part followers of the Noucentista aesthetic and cultural movement, were commissioned to decorate the interior of the Palau. Entrance from the front is by a huge staircase leading up from Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, flanked halfway by magnificent monumental illuminated fountains designed by Carles Bu\u00efgas.\n\nThe first projects to develop the slopes of Montju\u00efc, turning the mountain into the city's green lung and a leisure activity centre for the people of Barcelona, date back to the early 20th century. However, these ideas were given decisive momentum when Montju\u00efc was chosen as the site for the great International Exhibition organised by the city in 1929. The renowned Modernisme architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch was commissioned to direct the urban development and architectural aspects of this project, and Juan Claude Nicolas Forestier and Nicolau Maria Rubi\u00f3 i Tudur\u00ed landscaped the gardens. Under these plans, the Palau Nacional was to be the central palace for the exhibition. In 1923, the dictator Primo de Rivera seized power, with the result that Puig i Cadafalch was removed from the project. A competition to design and build the Palau Nacional was then won by the architects Eugenio P. Cendoya, Enric Cat\u00e0 and Pere Dom\u00e8nech i Roura. The palace was to provide the central venue for a great exhibition entitled Art in Spain and featuring original works and reproductions representing the history of Spanish art, complemented by two extensions: the Poble Espanyol (Spanish Village) architectural site, still open today, and the Palau d'Art Modern (Palace of Modern Art), which was later demolished.\nIn the area around the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya site, moreover, many of the buildings erected for the 1929 International Exhibition remain, whilst others have also been established. All these different elements form a complex that has become one of the most attractive cultural, commercial and leisure centres in the city. The outstanding buildings dating from the time of the International Exhibition include the pavilions housing the Barcelona Trade Fair (Fira de Barcelona), the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys, refurbished for the 1992 Games, the Poble Espanyol and the Teatre Grec, a Greek amphitheatre built in a disused quarry. This gives its name to Barcelona's summer arts festival (GREC).\n\n\n== Library and archive ==\nThe library is the most important documentation centre open to the public. Its origins go back to the books referred to by museum technicians in Barcelona when preparing for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. In the early 20th century, the Junta de Museus (Museums Board) decided that the library should be opened to the public, and decisive impetus was given to this initiative when the Special Committee for the Library was set up in 1907. From that year onwards, the library holdings were constantly enriched by legacies and donations from important private libraries.\nThe Museu Nacional Library collections comprise domestic and foreign books and magazines on different aspects of art: monographic works on art and artists; photography; numismatics; local history; a reserve section containing a collection of manuscripts; incunabula such as the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle; works published pre 1900; and the books of artists and collector's editions. Sections of particular interest include that devoted to exhibition catalogues, established in 1913 and containing printed matter on shows held at galleries in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain and even further afield, and \u2018The Press\u2019, established in 1968, which brings together news items published in the daily media and of interest to the artworld.\nIt is thanks to the Museu Nacional publications policy, that many of these works were acquired \u2013 it aims to promote exchanges and so provide the library with copies of works published by museums and art centres all over the world.\nThe library facilities are designed to provide Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya technical staff, researchers, students, art professionals and all individuals interested in the art world with all the information they seek. The reading room provides access to the library catalogue, the Collective Catalogue of Universities (CCUC), several databases (Princeton University, Index of Christian Art; Bibliography of the History of Art; Art Price), and to databases available on CD-ROM and Internet.\nAnother important element in the Museu Nacional organisational structure is the archive, founded as a department in 1995 to standardise management of the museum's documentary collections. With regard to the origin of these collections, the archive contains both documentation generated by the museum since 1991, when the consortium was set up, and historic documents from institutions that now form part of the Museu Nacional: the Museu d'Art de Catalunya (Art Museum of Catalonia), the Museu d'Art Modern (Museum of Modern Art), the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints, the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, and the Library of Art History.\nThe archive also conserves invaluable historic documentation in the form of the collections built up by different organising committees for fine art exhibitions (1891\u20131946). Here, too, are other historic resources related to the world of art and deposited in the museum over the years.\nFinally, the archive also contains a section devoted to the image, comprising some 350,000 audiovisual documents, mainly photographs, on different supports and in a variety of formats.\n\n\n== Museum Network ==\n\nThe Museus secci\u00f3 are part of Museu Nacional but they go under an independent management and ownership is on the respective councils. Currently three entities comprise:\n\nThe Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer: Victor Balaguer Museum Library is located at Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa and was founded in 1884 by Victor Balaguer as a sign of gratitude to the city for support received in his political career. It has a gallery specializing in Catalan painting of the 19th and 20h centuries, including works by Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, Ramon Casas, Joaquim Vayreda, Ramon Mart\u00ed Alsina, Dion\u00eds Baixeras, Isidre Nonell, Rafael Durancamps and  Xavier Nogu\u00e9s, among others. It also features works from different periods of art history, with an Egyptian collection, pre-Columbian, Filipino, East, archaeological and decorative arts. It also has placed works of art from the Museo del Prado.\nThe Cau Ferrat: located in Sitges, near the beach of San Sebastian, was the home study of Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol. It was opened as a museum in 1935, and exhibit several collections related to modernism and the artist. There is a large collection of iron, glass and ceramics. As for painting and drawing, man can see works of El Greco, Ramon Casas, Miquel Utrillo, Ignacio Zuloaga, Anglada Camarasa, Picasso and Dar\u00edo de Regoyos, among others. One of the peculiarities is the same provision of the works.\nThe County Museum of la Garrotxa: located in Olot, specializes in Catalan painting and more specifically members of the School of Olot. One can view works by artists such as Ramon Casas, Xavier Nogu\u00e9s, Leonci Quera, Ramon Amadeu, Miquel Blay and Josep Clar\u00e0 as well as a collection of Art Nouveau posters.\n\n\n== Educational activities ==\n\nOne of the other aspects of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has an educational service itself, which offers several resources for learning and services tailored to different audiences. Among others, a program is the museum common space of integration aimed at people at risk of exclusion and use the museum as a key integrator and software Museum hosts, aimed at integrating with other training projects related to art.\nAnother of the best known proposals is Museum as an integration space (El Museu espai com\u00fa d'integraci\u00f3, in Catalan), and also  A hand of stories (Una Ma de Contes), a joint initiative between Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya and Museu Nacional, which explains 20 short stories representing 20 paintings of Museu Nacional permanent collection, with a different look.\nThere are also activities which are encouraged in the relationship between children and artists active. They participated in activities such contemporary artists as Philip Stanton Gino Rubert or Llu\u00efsa Jover.\n\n\n== Restoration and Preventive Conservation Centre ==\n\nThe aim of the Department of the Restoration and Preventive Conservation is to ensure the conservation of all the works in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collections. The Department helps to guarantee the physical conservation of all the museum's holdings, including both works on exhibition and in storage, on deposit or on loan, whilst also seeking to delay as far as possible the ageing process that affects the materials that form the artworks. In addition, the Restoration and Preventive Conservation Department also studies the materials and the technical aspects of works with a view to providing scientific and technical assistance for art historians specialising in different periods, promoting dialogue and interdisciplinary studies.\nAt the centre, professionals from different specialist disciplines study problems affecting the works, or changes they are undergoing, determining the causes of deterioration and doing their utmost to eliminate any risk to the works. In this regard, a key aim is to create a stable environment and to establish the best conditions for exhibiting, storing, handling, packing and transporting works. The centre seeks to minimise deterioration to the collections by ensuring that the most appropriate environmental conditions and exhibition systems are provided, as well as exercising strict control over the movement of objects and the restoration treatments applied to individual works.\nMost of the activity at the centre is concerned with prevention, but due importance is also attached to reparative treatment and restoration. Restoration work is aimed at improving the aesthetic reading of pieces on which, very often, restorers from much earlier generations have previously intervened, working according to criteria very different from those applied today. Needless to say, restoration is not carried out in the hope of returning works to their original state; but rather, to take into account the passing of time and any work that has already been carried out on the piece, and which now forms part of the history of restoration in Catalonia in general.\nThe center exists due to the impulse that Joaquim Folch i Torres gave to the project when he sent Manuel Grau i Mas in Milan with the objective that was formed by the hand of Mauro Pelliccioli, then director of the restoration laboratories in Milan, attached to the Pinacoteca di Brera art gallery. The Milan laboratories had a decisive influence on how restoration work was carried out all over Europe. Work continues today with a view to establishing the Museu Nacional Department of Restoration and Preventive Conservation as a reference and resource, which may operate separately from the museum itself, in terms both of the working methodologies and the rigour and the criteria that the centre applies.\nThe centre is staffed by scientific personnel devoted to preventive conservation and chemical laboratory work, and by a team of curators and restorers specialising in various disciplines, in accordance with the types of works that form the museum collections: restoration of paint on canvas and transferred painted murals; paint on wooden panels; polychrome wood sculpture; furniture; artwork on paper and photography; and stone, metal and ceramic.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nList of Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya directors since its foundation \n\n1934\u20131939: Joaquim M.

          "Hey if you are into the genre check it out - a bit hard to get to and not a must see -The nearby Miro Museum is",
          "If you are like me and not a very big museum person, you will throughly enjoy the view from up there. You can sit with some Cava or beer, meats and cheese from the food stand at the top. Beautiful view with great ambiance of music from street performers.",
          "This museum features Catalonian and Spanish art as its forte. We did not go inside to see art. Instead, we visited the Montjuic area for the visual impact of the beautiful structures and buildings. This imposing building occupies the top of the hill above the Magic Fountain in",
          "Super venue for art: organized and displayed with aplomb. Great news: Oval Ball is spectacular. El Greco, Goya, a few Picassos, Miro wall art, early Salvador Dali, and of course the my favourite Roman Casa and Pere Romeu in Tandem on a Bicycle (4 Gats for breakfast was",
          "The climb up may have been steep, but the view was beautiful and the fountain is lovely. I hear at 8pm certain nights there is a fountain show. Then we got into the art and mostly saw all the Modern art. Fabulous pieces and variety. We went right up to the roof - make sure you",
          "Free for seniors, our favorite museum in town as there is so much excellent cultural art from the region, lots of unique pieces all set in a splendid interior. We keep coming back, so much to see.",

          "Not only the are is fantastic but also the museum! One visit is definitely not enough to cherish the tresure of art it has!",
          "The Museum is well worth a visit to see all the beautiful works of art from all eras. The collection is quite easy to walk through and could be done in around 2 hours altogether. Lots of the original pieces have been taken directly from the churches which is quite interesting.",
          "This is a wonderful museum with a great collection. The lighting and general presentation is also excellent. Hugely impressed that it was free of charge for seniors too. I am, however, still in two minds about the extraordinary Romanesque collection. Whilst I feel certain that",
          "This is a marvellous building over-looking Barcelona, so it's worth going up there just for the view. The main fountain has a son et lumiere in the evening which is also definitely worth a look. Ticket price is not too excessive but later afternoon Saturday it's free, so try",
          "This eclectic collection of medieval, renaissance, Catalonian art during the period of Franco and Byzantine frescos is truly excellently displayed and annotated. It was a revelation to us since we knew very little about the museum prior to our visit.",
          "I love this museum. If you want to know Catalonia and it's cultural background as well as it's modern character, you should definitely go there. I have visited it several times. Normally you'll need an hour or two, depends on your style of visiting. Besides the area is beautiful",
          "The collection of artwork spanned from Gothic all the way to modern artwork. The paintings taken from churches in the Pyrenees were incredible to witness. Some of the romanesque paintings were more intense than any I'd seen before, but I enjoyed them thoroughly. I would have",
          "It was the first Sunday of November so we got in free. Hurray! Huge place so in spite of the crowds, it did not feel congested. Managed to pick out 2-3 key Picasso\u2019s including the iconic \u201cWoman in Hat and Fur Collar\u201d. Loved the curation and how the galleries were laid out. But",

          "Spending the morning around the Montjuic area, so as not to be overwhelmed decided to miss out the ground floor gallery and focus on the first floor gallery. This worked really well, there is plenty to see, as well as painings a range of furniture and glass panels. The",

          "We kept it simple and just moved about the museum on our own. So much to take in and the quality of the exhibits impressive. The building was equally impressive and shrouded easy to access exhibition rooms. Nice gift shop if you were to look to bring a gift back home for",

          "An absolute must for any visitor, if not just for the amazing art but the great views of the city. It has frescoes of art taken from churches across Spain dating back up to 1,000 years displayed as they would have been seen in the Church. Then it has another section of Gothic",
          "The national Museum of Catalonia is an interesting place, Because I love art, and painting in the first place, then, of course, could not go to this Museum, which is also located in such a picturesque place. Loved it, we were gone all day, I recommend)",
          "Beautiful art collection sorted in a fine order. This really is a massive collection of art from all periods. I liked the medieval reconstructions of wall paintings from various rural monasteries and churches, not something seen anywhere else. Make sure you have at least half a",
          "We went because of the romanesque art, which totally blew us away with it's fantastic quality. I have never before seen such a beautiful collection of frescoes and all in excellent preservation. They are shown so that they resemble the way they would have looked in their",
          "Not only does this museum have really beautiful exhibits of all sorts, but it's situated at the top of the hill in the city with an extraordinary view! People spend hours just waiting for the sunset from that point. Sadly, I didn't have that luxury, but I did go to the rooftop",
          "It was a bigger and original sight of the Plaza de Espana from Rome. We are in Spain so the name fits the place. The place is worth the price paid on the sight-seeing bus in order to arrive effortlessly at the top where the museum is located. A beautiful place to take a photo",
          "This museum takes you through art from medieval times up through modern. An expansive collection that gives you a great overview without being overwhelming. I particularly enjoyed the sections on Art Nouveau and Belle \u00c9poque. The museum has furniture and room settings that I",
          "The Catalonian art gallery is located in an impressive domed building atop a hill, at the end of the Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina. I am not an art buff, but still enjoyed my visit and felt \u20ac12 was a reasonable price (it includes a second visit within the month if you want",

          "The views were stunning. Did not happen to go into the museum, but was at the grounds. It gives you a super view of the city",
          "Was a little disappointed by the museum itself but surrounding area was so lovely for a stroll. They did have a few pieces in the collection that were lovely!!!",
          "You can reach most of the way by escalators which may not be obvious. Also look for days/times (Saturday after 3PM) when entrance is free. Huge place so you may want to concentrate on special exhibit or one of the halls. Go up to the terrace (elevator and steps) for great",
          "Be mindful of the hours as they chnage seasonally on Sundays. We were only there for a couple fo hours which was not enough time. The museum is awesome and provides a great overview of not only the art but the politics of Catalunya and Spain in general. Very interesting",
          "We came here on a Friday afternoon at around 1pm. It was so easy to get to and the view from the front entrance was amazing. There is a huge collection of art inside the museum and it wasn\u2019t crowded at all. I really enjoyed the visit. We spent about 2-3 hours here.",
          "3 years ago it rained the night we were going to go to the National Museum area to see the Magic Fountain and then last month, on our second visit to Barcelona, we made it. Although it rained again, it stopped just in time for the amazing fountain and music show. Check out the",
          "Great museum on Romanesque and Gothic art, and an incredible spectacle of fountain pools and gardens down the mountain to the plaza. We liked the outside as much as the art on the inside.",
          "One of the few sites that actually had escalators running on the exterior of this multi-level attraction, although there are a few steps to climb to reach the museum level. It's an impressive site with fountains, waterfalls, Egyptian columns, with the museum at the very top of",

          "With 2 floors and 81 galleries this really is a massive collection of art from all periods. If you have plenty of time then probably best to keep coming back and do a bit at a time. I really liked the medieval reconstructions of wall paintings from various rural monasteries and",

          "with little time, I went to the medieval areas on ground floor. The collection of Roman and Christian art is impressive. I wish i had more time to look at each piece in detail. I have never seen a picture of Peter crucified upside down. Brilliant.",
          "It\u2019s definitely a must see if you happen to visit Barcelona. Beautiful art collection sorted in a fine order, which makes your journey a top notch one. Make sure you have a couple of hours saved in advance to check it out fully.",
          "This was one of those places I fell in love with from the first moment we entered the Romanesque section. It\u2019s somewhere on my list to return to as the location and contents are worthy of more time there. A wonderful experience",
          "Display of the art collection is simply amazing and well organised. Very comprehensive. There were section on medieval art, gothic era and modern art.",
          "The museum is so big that I didn\u2019t have enough time too see it all. I recommend spending at least three hours here. It is a must for anyone who likes art. From romanesque through to modern times, there is history to be seen",

          "Buy the audio tour to fully enjoy this great museum . The exhibits are organized by major categories and take about an hour each to walk thru. You are led from 1300s to present modern art exhibits . Certainly a world class collection and very interesting insight into Catalonian",
          "This is the third time we visited this museum. The section of Catalan Romanesque Art is truly amazing. There are many types of works, paintings, sculpture and frescos. Many frescos have been removed from the original church using them so that the can be protected and conserved.",
          "The best art museum in the city above the meam. The environment of the museum is enviable. I recommend spending two or three hours.",
          "Five star is for the night show water fountain for the museum. It is better than the magic fountain show in my opinion. Postcard worthy!",
          "A really good experience. The price for the main collection is 12 Eur, ant it is worth it, because the collection is really big. The museum is really well planned, so you cannot get lost and you walk from the oldest pieces of art to the newest. We went after 3 pm, and there were",
          "I highly recommend if you have time or love art to visit this museum. Catalonia has a unique history and they show this off with their art as well. The meuesum has art from the medieval (Gothic and Romanesque) up to the modern time. By far my favorite sections were the",
          "We spend 5 hous in this museum and it could have been more. To walk up there along the fountains and the waterfuls ist also already great",
          "The selection of art included Romanesque through to modern. There was so much to see I want to return. The building and the gardens were fantastic as well.",
          "Stopped here on the hop on hop off bus and it was an impressive facade to photograph. Also had great views of the city. If I came again would go inside but we got there pretty late and were tired from walking all day.",
          "My husband and I bought the Museum pass, which worked great for us, because we were interested in 4 out of the 5 museums the pass gave us entrance to. We visited before noon, there were no lines and the museum is so large one never has to contend with corwded spaces. Much of",
          "If the views and steps outside the museum itself weren't enough, the inside of the museum houses a vast collection of Catalonian artwork from various historical periods. The admission ticket is good for two days, so you could spend the hot afternoons inside over a couple of",
          "A must visit place in Barcelona with its own history and amazing views. A great place to simply sit ( in the shade) and watch life pass you by.",
          "A must see. Fantastic building in itself. Viewed the medieval and gothic Middle Ages sections and was so impressed. It\u2019s well set out. Easy to navigate around. A cafe for lunch. Very reasonable entry prices. One of the best art galleries I\u2019ve seen. Would recommend.",

          "My friend and I were not planning on going but we were walking and saw the museum up on a hill so decided to check it out and we are so happy we did. The infinity fountains are amazing and the museum had a lot of cool art from contemporary to medieval to renaissance..just about",

          "Visited this museum at Plaza de Espanya where we had been the previous evening to watch Magic Fountains. It is a huge place with different sections housing various art styles. It is located on top of a hill and has a commanding view. At the bottom of the hill is the Magic",
          "This museum focuses on Catalunyan artists. There are some surprisingly interesting pieces. If you like art this is worth a visit.",
          "Start from the avenue below the museum and RIDE THE ESCALATORS up to the museum! You'll pass by fantastic fountains, pools, and waterfalls. And the view from the top is spectacular. Oh, and the museum is pretty damned good too! The collections are extensive, and well",
          "Very large museum with plenty of space and a lovely interior. The interactive bouncy castle is an interesting touch, situated in a vast auditorium with a huge organ. Lovely walk from the top floor around it. Very interesting gothic collection and a very interesting and eclectic",
          "It\u2019s mainly paintings .. for me and I always go to museums in every country I visit , it was boring ,boring,boring.",
          "Lies somewhat out of the center. Nice panorama over Barcelona. Great collection Gothic art and modernism.",
          "I can't say my wife & I are real art buffs but can appreciate it in it's simplest form. I can however say that if you are more appreciative of art then you will be more than happy spending a good few hours taking in all the museum has to offer.",
          "The museum is very interesting and big, unfortunately it closes very early in the afternoon and it's difficult to visit it just in a few hours.",
          "This museum is worth a visit just for the view over Barcelona. But the art works are brilliant as well. Gothic,Romanesque,Renaissance as well as 19th and 20th century collections",
          "The National Art Museum in Barcelona houses an amazing collection of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque art alongside it's collections of fine arts from 19th and 20th century. Some of the most outstanding items are in the religious art collection such as the Romanesque",
          "The entire area around the museum and the Espania Plaza can be done together. I recommend purchasing the ticket online, and checking if the museum is open before you visit. The place is excellent for pictures.",
          "The Museu Nacional was not high on our list of tourist type places, but it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable. The building itself is impressive. The view from the roof is fun, although not so much different from the Cathedral and Basilica roofs. But the best is inside.",
          "This probably doesn't get the attention it deserves - but so well worth visiting. You can go for free after 1500 on the last Saturday of the month - but it is still worth paying for and they do have senior discounts. It is spectacular to see the building itself from many venues",
          "he Art Museum building sits on the side of the hill overlooking Espania Plaza. From the metro stop on the plaza, you walk along the broad parkway up multiple levels to reach the museum itself. If you are lucky you get to make this walk when the fountains are active (they are",

          "Starting from the way up to get there, a tiny park, escalators, the building itself, continuing the opportunity to climb to the roof for the most spectacular views of the city, walk around on the roof to enjoy various perspectives, and then, enjoy the wonderful exhibitions of",
          "I gasped as I turned the corner onto this stunning property. Then the inside allows you to view the classic paintings that you learn about in your youth. I was awestruck at all the Masters I was fortunate enough to see. Then the outside of the building is majestic as you climb",
          "In a city like Barcelona, this museum is probably not at the top of most visitors' list of things-to-see, but my visit here was a fantastic experience. I never thought that I could walk through a museum packed with frescos for over an hour, without getting bored. But these",
          "We visited the museum on the last Saturday of the month, when the entrance after 15:00 is free, but it is worth paying for this museum. A very rich collection of modern art.",
          "It is near to exhibition center, after our visit finish, we visit this place. You can use moving staircase until top of the museu, otherwise it is difficult to climb all stair under sun.",
          "Best to visit this site in the early evening, when the street performers put on a show and show their wares. The fountain is absolutely mesmerising and this was the highlight of my Barcelona experience.",

          "After a few days visiting Barcelona, we decided to climb the Montjuic to explore the national museum. Took the funicular at Para-lel station to reach the museum instead of climbing via Placa Espanya. It is a different way to reach it and quite pleasant if we walk thru the",

          "Really enjoyed this Museum, had experienced a bunch teenager were on a school outing and never heard a peep!",
          "First off, the site and building are beautiful. The approach from the Plaza de Espanya is dramatic, with a series of \"waterfall\" fountains cascading down the hill away from the museum, a former palace. The views of the city below from the building's steps is terrific.",
          "Spent couple hours here and enjoyed Catalunyan art, saw bunch middle school kids here on outing never heard a peep from them wow!!",
          "We just enjoyed strolling through Museu Nacional D Art De Catalunya and admiring all the art work done. There was bunch of middle school kids and strolling through and never heard them make a noise. At 2100 at night have light display show outside.",
          "Decided to visit MNAC as we had a day of inclement weather which limited our ability to sight-see outdoors. The museum is in a wonderful position perched on Montjuic with fabulous views across the city. The collection is focused on local Catalonian art but the breadth of the",

          "The art on display was a little too... classic... for me. The building and grounds were incredible though.",
          "The building is impressive in itself and the location on top of the hill overlooking Barcelona provides great views. The art gallery has the most Impressive collection of Medieval Romanico and Gothic art I have seen. I also booked the viewing gallery at the top of the building",
          "I took photos from every part! Inside this museum was a bit complicated to us, we went wrong way and in the end were tired of looking for the correct signs. I recommend to wait until the evening for the Magic fountain.",
          "The building itself is worth a visit and the views over the city. Admission to the museum is free however you do have to pay to view any special exhibitions. There is a restaurant on the first floor with floor to ceiling windows making the most of the views. There is a snack bar",
          "We spent about 2.5h inside and everything was amazing. All the expositions were interesting either for adults or the children. You can also buy souvenirs and also there are some options to eat in case the visiting has consumed all your energy. The view from the terraces and from",

          "We spent the day at this museum and plan to go back for a second day. The collection in romanesque art is one of the best in the world. It is worth a trip to Barcelona just to see the frescoes rescued from churches in the Pyrenees. But the modern art holdings are also rich",

          "Impressive building and grounds. It's going to be crowded so be aware. Best view is from the top of building. Take elevator to the left of entry into building and up stairs. Fountain falls were awesome and best picture at the bottom looking up. Security everywhere so very",
          "Set in lovely grounds with magnificent views over Barcelona. Collection is good but best of all includes a Picasso which is \u201cmore famous\u201d than anything we saw in the Picasso gallery the previous day! Nice bar outside too, can get beers and snacks. Definitely recommend.",
          "we came here to fill some time before catching the flight home. Free entry on the first Sunday of the month so was a bargain. lots to see and will take a few hours to get around. the cafe has some gluten free muffins to have with a coffee so that was a bonus. we were able to",

          "The Museum and its grounds/fountain are pretty stunning from the outside. We deliberately visited inside when it was free entry (Saturday after 3pm). You could spend a whole day viewing all the exhibits, but as we were time limited, we spent around 3 hours strolling through as",
          "The museum was the perfect size for a rainy morning--interesting but not overwhelming. We especially enjoyed the Romanesque wing with the frescos form churches. A video was very interesting in showing how the frescos were removed from the churches and installed in the museum.",
          "This is a beautiful museum with the best Romanesque, Renaissance and Gothic Art. They also have Modern Art. Lots of places to sit in the main areas. The terrace views on approach from the side of the Palau are great with jazz music being played by street performer. Upon",

          "Impressive building, with one of the best views over the city. Not crowded (at least in a weekday). You can ask questions to the personnel in the rooms and get meaningful (and interesting) answers. And same as many other attractions in the city, easy public transportation.",

          "Most of the contents originate from Catalonia, but there are a few surprises, Sisley, Burne-Jones, Munch, Cranach for example. There is some great stuff in the 80 or so rooms, but two things stand out for me. First is the building itself, especially the Oval room, one of the",
          "We always find an art museum. A wide variety of art is available to view and their is a lovely cafe. The entry ticket is only 12 Euros and is good for two days. We saw everything! Worth the climb up to it.",

          "The curator had a vision and carried it through beautifully. You leave this exhibition with your opinion transformed about how Gala contributed to Salvador \u2018s art. You also depart, wanting to know more about them and wanting to visit Pubol. (Which I did, and found it further",
          "I previously visited Barcelona 24 years ago in 1994. When I was there, I was disappointed that the National Museum of Catalan Art was temporarily closed. Now, almost a quarter century later, I have finally made good on missing this museum by returning to Barcelona and finding it",
          "This museum features superb displays of Catalonian history . Everything fom pre- historic times to ending of opportunity for Catalonian independence is included. Employees are very helpful and informative. Cost was inexpensive. Highly recommended.",
          "Plan your time well. You could spend a whole day here and not take it all in. Beautiful spot to watch the Magic Fountain from as well.",
          "Loved the Dal\u00ed exhibit that\u2019s there through October 14. Tried every elevator in the place before finding ONE out of five that would go to the top floor (hubby had knee surgery and can\u2019t do stairs). Modern art exhibit was pretty good, but our toddler lost her mind so we had to",
          "By luck we got inside free of charge as it was free after 3 PM. Very impressive pieces of art and enough space even tho there were a lot of tourists. A pleasant experience.",
          "Loved the art and architecture. Was a nice place to just take a nice walk outside and enjoy the area and the city views",
          "We stopped here on our way to the cable car lift. The walk up to the building itself is lovely. and once at the top theres great views over the city. Because we only had limited time i wish we spent more time inside the museum.",
          "This is a high-quality museum. In our humble opinion, surpassed the Prado in Madrid. The way the museum displays the frescoes is just outstanding. I took the more pictures here than I did on my entire three-week trip to Spain.",
          "At least give yourself 3 hours to visit. There are four sections. The Roman gallery is more religious while the other galleries are more artistic. Surprisingly they are collections of Japanese arts. Saturday afternoon is free. Choose an evening to visit and then you can see the",
          "I spent a couple of hours admiring the collections of Medieval, Gothic and Romanesque art at this fantastic museum. For the large part, I felt like I had the whole place to myself as most of the other visitors seemed to be only interested in the temporary Gala Dali exhibition.",
          "Only visited here initially to see the Dali/Gala exhibition but also visited the Modernist/Impressionist galleries too. The exhibits are really well presented and laid out with some really stunning pieces and the site on the Montjuic Hill is lovely with great views of the city.",
          "This has got to be the most impressive architecture for a museum I\u2019ve ever seen. The outside has beautiful columns and not one, but 2 sets of waterfalls. It\u2019s on a top of a hill and you can get a great panoramic photo of the city of Barcelona. You can even the the Sagrada",
          "The building is fantastic. We did not go inside as we didn\u2019t have time, but we will definately visit again.",
          "I got the art passport in Barcelona, but did not have time to visit all of the museums. Nevertheless I visited MNAC two days in a row, because it was that good. The medieval collection is divided into Romanesque and Gothic, and both are extensive and unique, with a focus on",
          "If you want to look beyond the modernistas, MNAC is the place to go. Huge gallery with an amazing collection of Romanesque and Baroque art, plus some obligatory modernista items of interior design, alongside other interesting works from the C19 - C20. Lots of places to sit",
          "This museum is worth a visit for medieval works in the region. I enjoyed the various paintings, sculptures, tapestries on display. The building also gives you a great view of the city and has a nice park in the area so it adds to the overall experience. The ticket is actually",
          "This museum was fantastic, among the top few of the major art museums I have visited around the world! An incredible building. Works inside well placed and identified. Great placement for the flow of the art through the centuries. And a huge amount of art to see--give",
          "Saturday afternoon is for free - found by accident. The collection of modern art (paintings, some sculptures, furniture and 1930 posters) is very interesting despite its \"local\" specification. The printed guide is nice and not overpriced. Buffet is pricey (can of coke for 3,75",
          "This museum houses the finest collection of Romanesque mural painting. We were in awe and could not believe this treasure. The museum also holds renaissance, baroque and modern art. While we were there, there was a special exhibition on Gala Salvador Dali, Dali's wife, and",
          "It's very large and very quiet, not very crowded, especially in the modern art galleries. A peaceful place where you can experience art at a leisurely pace.",
          "The Museum itself is an impeccable space and a great way to spend the afternoon. If you're visiting before October check out the Dali/Gala exhibit.",
          "Affordable and rich inside, nice view outside. Great collection of renaissance & gothic artifacts you can combine with Montjiuc castle visit, cable car will take you to the top, you can walk down the stairs and take pictures all the way",
          "Like many art museums, this one is too big to see everything. Choose which periods are most interesting, and focus on seeing those areas. The area called Modern Art isn't what you might consider \"modern\". It's art since the Romanesque/Baroque area and includes impressionism,",
          "Interesting sellection of this theme and always think that the best pieces of art are hidden in the private collections and Dal\u00ed's Museum in Figueres",
          "The view from here is great. The Gala-Dali exhibition was lovely and I saw the painting of gala with the spheres that I like so much. There were a lot of beautiful paintings. You should visit.",
          "I went there on a Saturday around 18:00 with my family, since on Saturdays after 15:00 the entry is free. We were really surprised to see that the line wasn\u2019t long at all and moved really fast, despite of the free entry! It took us about 5 min to get in. We went to see the Dali",
          "This museum was my favorite cultural experience in Barcelona. Because there were only 80 rooms, I was able to see every piece in the museum within 2-3 hours. The medieval murals are a must-see, as well as the modernisme/Art Nouveau-style furniture. The two modern art wings were",
          "I came here primarily for the magic fountain. This museum building is impressive and imposing. It makes a great backdrop when taking photos of the fountain. I did not go inside the museum, but had a beautiful view of the surrounding areas since it was at the high point. There",
          "Very spectacular entrance, quick entry systems and loads to see inside. Cafe nice and quiet when we were there.",
          "We visited the Dali exposition and then followed the tour which starts with a rooftop visit. Impressive building, and so are the garden and its fountains.... be aware that the latter are only active during a few days a week.. I thought on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from the",
          "Being in a cool location in the middle of the day was purposeful in our planning. This fit the bill perfectly. It is a beautiful building, stunning views, and the range of art is sure to appeal to anyone who enjoys museums. I thoroughly enjoyed the Gala Dali (S Dali's wife)",
          "The building and concert hall inside are amazing and worth the visit. The art galleries I heard are also very good but this will cost you 60 euros for two adults or about $72---not a great buy. Don't go on Monday as it is closed.",
          "Well organised and lots to see, so much so that I didn't finish it. It takes a while to get to thou and the restaurant is only for those feeling affluent, thee is a cafe for pockets like mine... This place is amazing, I can't stress that enough",
          "Get there early when it opens! We went straight to the roof and had it to ourselves. Tremendous views! The Medieval Gothic and Christian Art was impressive and well worth the time. The paintings, murals, sculptors, ceramics and other artifacts were in remarkably good shape.",
          "This museum was a beautiful sight from the moment I laid eyes on the building itself. The palace where it is located looked magnificent, especially if viewed from the Font M\u00e0gica de Montju\u00efc (The Magic Fountain is also very worth the visit at the beginning of a summer night,",
          "I cannot recommend this museum highly enough. Frankly, I'd even recommended splitting your visit over two days just to be able to process the amount of art and it's diverse range (which your general admission ticket will allow). I've been fortunate enough to visit several times,",
          "highly recommendation.. a big learning .. again a MUST see,, places around there are culinary No no's.. just order HAM is always good.. takes quite a few hours..",
          "This museum is a must to visit when in Barcelona in terms of art, architecture and food. We wandered around for a couple of hours then had lunch in the restaurant which was pricey but great view, service and food.",
          "Just a note, it is not only Catalunyan are. There is something for every taste. My favourite part is the second floor (modernism). The ticket is valid for 2 days. I did the visit with the audio guide and loved it.",
          "We visited the National Catalunya Museum on our last day in Barcelona. There is a lot of history and historical artifacts that are on display hear with many being several hundred years old. The location is beautiful and so is the building. We hiked up the stairs and",
          "Well worth a visit. Start behind the museum and look at the Olypic Stadium then use the open air escalators down into the museum grounds.",
          "This museum offers a wide range of art, some of which should satisfy everyone\u2019s tastes. While it does not compare to the Louvre or Uffizzi in terms of overall quality of the pieces, there is much to like. The layout seemed better organized than a lot of art museums too. The",
          "The trek up the hill to M\u2019NAC, with its wonderful views, is worth the fun alone! There are always some interesting exhibits - I always like to check out the modernisme stuff. The photos from the top of the hill are worth the visit alone.",
          "Let me start by saying I did not even look at the modern art. The rest of the museum was quite interesting. The galleries were numbered! I did not get lost like we \"all\" do in large museums. SAT after 1500 (until closing) - FREE admission (stumbled across this nice fact",
          "Wonderful art museum in an old palace. Roman, gothic and baroque art on the first floor. 2nd floor is modern art starting in the 1850's or so forward. Not as prestigious as the Louvre, but still a nice way to pass afternoon out of the heat of the city. Wonderful sweeping vista",
          "Such a beautiful palace and I saw the Salvador Dali exhibit, which was fantastic. The grounds and fountains are beautiful.",
          "Is a very good museum - I've been here twice - first time with my wife and this time with my brother. If your spending more then 3 days in Barcelona I would highly advise this museum - it's also very beautiful to walk around the park close by and enjoy the view on top of the",
          "I am a big fan of audio guides and this one did not disappoint. The museum is also very well planned to make your visit more enjoyable because it's easy to navigate. Beautiful collection! And if you are in Barcelona the first Sunday of the month, entrance is free but you'll do",
          "Beautiful walk up to Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. Need a good day to see all the wonderful artworks and sculptures. Beautifully kept grounds and galleries with world renowned artist and works.",
          "Picked up a museum pass while visiting Barcelona. We planned on seeing this museum and the Picasso museum during our stay and the museum pass is a bargain if you visit more than one museum. The surrounding area of Montju\u00efc is stunning and the crown jewel is the Museo d\u2019arte de",
          "Not necessarily being a fan of the \u2018arts\u2019 but when an opportunity arises to see an exhibition of one of the great modern artists of our time, then you take that opportunity. Not knowing much about Salvador Dali and the influence that Gala had on his life, the exhibition gave us",
          "Not only is the interior and collection of the museum fantastic and impressive, but the outside plaza and cascading steps and waterfalls, and the view of the city, make for a beautiful photo stop. Art lovers must go here and the Picasso Museum in my opinion! We took a taxi to",
          "Walked over after being told the nearby Archaeological Museum cost 50+ euros (we\u2019re still scratching our heads). The art museum is affordable, amazing and huge. We spent a couple hours just in the early European church sections. Great exhibition carefully displayed. Then went",
          "the museum is beautiful, great for photos. We take our architecture students to visit every year. wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking.",
          "We stumble upon the Palau Nacional as we wanted to go see the Poble Espagnol and Montjuic and wow are we glad we did, they have a gorgeous view of the city and the castle itself is incredible... they have escalators for people who need them or you can walk up the stairs the good",
          "The views of the art and the building itself make this a stunning visit \u2014 and the views of Barcelona from the steps of the museum ice the cake. This building was constructed for the World\u2019s fair, and even hosted performances by the famous Spanish horses at one time. Walk",
          "We were walking around the gardens near Montjuic and happened to see this huge building. We weren't sure what it is and decided to walk up to it. It's a pretty amazing building, with gold and blue. They have a little coffee shop on the outside where you can sit and enjoy the",
          "On top of the location, the wiews of the city, the magnificent building, this museum offers the oportunity to enjoy the paints foud in hidden little curches in the Pyrenees, and preserved in the Museum. Uniques in the world!",
          "I could spend countless days wandering around this museum. Beautiful architecture and location with wonderful works of art and history!!!",
          "this museum is about average. i have seen better ones in other major cities. it is fairly large but the focus is too narrow to be worthwhile to mainstream people wanted to visit an art museum.",
          "Great place to take pictures. Amazing artwork inside. You can sit and relax in the garden after your visit.",
          "They tool apart dozens of medieval and ancient churches in the Pyrenees and Catalunia and put them back together here. Walking here is like a walk through a bunch of ancient monasteries. Absurdly stunning altar pieces and triptecs, Some of the best medieval art I've ever seen.",
          "Great place for photos (esp the roof!) and full of art from a broad range of styles. In some exhibits the placards weren\u2019t translated, so I\u2019m not sure how much new information I learned.",
          "My family visited there on June 16. Our visiting time there was very short. So we didn't see entire museum as details. But we're very pleased to see cultural heritage there during short time. It's must see place in Barcelona as well.",
          "There is undoubtably some great art in this museum but our experience was spoiled by the layout which makes progression through the museum very confusing and the audio guide didn't help.",
          "The admission was \u20ac12 and worth every cent. It is a gorgeous building and has two floors that comprise medieval, romantic, and modern art. There was a LOT of religious art that I would have gone to last because it was a bit much after a while. We spent between 3 and 4 hours",
          "I feel like I must start by saying that I love art museums and the Museu National is no exception. I will also add that my companions who are not as in love with museums enjoyed our time there! I particularly enjoyed the 'modern' collection where I was introduced to artists whom",
          "Interesting collection of Catalonian artists. Not very expensive and your ticket is worth 2 visits! Used the Hop on Hop Off bus for visits.",
          "What an amazing place!!! I want so much to return and take it all in again. The collection of art, and variety is first class. I easily could have spent another long day there just savoring it.",
          "It's worth to see this museum. You can take the hop on hop off ride or take bus 13 or 150 and take a long walk. Don't worry, there are escalators to make it easy for you. But as I have said, it's really worth since once you are on top and see the exhibits, it is really amazing.",
          "We visit most Art Museums in the cities we visit. So we visited this one. The highlight, by far, was the wing dedicated to the preservation of Frescos. There were many small churches (without climate control?) that had deteriorating frescos. In the early 1900s they started a",
          "Really stunning walk up to the venue and then an absolutely incredible example of Spanish architecture with a great collection of exhibits over the ages. Fully recommend escaping the sun to have an air conditioned walk around some Catalonian culture.",
          "Fantastic building, housing some excellent art. The two Modernism wings were a real high-point. The auditorium at the rear of the building is quite something too.",
          "The building, gardens and views by itself are worth the visit and if you like art even more. It is not the biggest collection, specially compared to other museums in Europe, but still very interesting. My favorite part was the murals and how they were able to save/recreate the",
          "First off my wife and I did not go into the Museum. What we did was buy a Bus Hop-On , Hop-Off ticket from the Bus Turistico when we first arrived at the train station to start our trip. So we took the red line bus route and got off at the MNAC Museum stop. This building that",
          "Went here. Proposed to my girlfriend on the steps of the art museum. Inside was very cool, but a lot of focus on Salvador Dail.Most people just come here for the views of Barcelona from the museum steps.",
          "The museum was built as a temporary exhibit for an expo almost a 100 years ago and has been exquisitely restored. Being on a hill, the frontage offers a wonderful view of the city with dancing illuminated fountains enhancing the grandeur of the 4 columns and other magnificent",
          "Catalonia has a wealth of medieval frescoes, which were removed from their regional churches and brought here. You won't find a treasure like this elsewhere! The museum also houses excellent later medieval, renaissance and baroque art. We were impressed by the richness and",
          "The best thing about this museum is the view standing out front of it looking out at the fountain and the city down below. The pictures we got were beautiful, however that was the best part of this experience. The museum itself was not very interesting at all. We have been to",
          "This is a wonderful museum, situated high on a sweeping hill overlooking Barcelona. But have no fear, from the metro you can simply take a series of outdoor escalators right to the front door! That's good because the museum itself is large and requires a lot of walking. The hit",
          "Best of all was the free admission for those over 65. Just show proof and in you go! Many wonderful pieces of art. Loved the old religious artifacts. Modern art wasn't that great but we didn't miss the tour of the top of the museum where you could see all of barcelona.",
          "We spent most of the day in this vicinity and a considerable amount of time in this beautiful museu. It was quiet and cool: perfect for enjoying the art work. So glad we went.",
          "Do not be afraid looking up from Plaza Espana. there are escalators so you only have to climb a few steps (stick to the right going up and left going down). The location kept me away my first 2 visits to Barcelona. The paintings range from early religious art to contemporary",
          "If you like religious art, this is the place. Wewanted tto seethe fountains inits full function but they were not on. So disappointing. I guess because it was raining. Greta grounds.",
          "The view surrounding the museum is priceless. You are immersed in a captivating view of Barcelona. The museum itself is vast and you won't be able to see everything in one day so when you get your map it's worth being strategic to highlight the pieces you want to see or the",
          "Unbelievable view from National Palace overlooking Magic fountain of Montjuic. Walk down from there to Placa Espana and look up from each landing - view is truly spectacular.",
          "We spent a few hours here, and still only saw part of it - you could spend all day here. BUT - Take snacks and drinks, the cafe is exorbitantly priced (even for a museum!) 11.90 euros for a small can of coke and a pre packaged (english style) basic sandwich.",
          "we sought lunch in the restaurant but were disappointed. 90euro for two courses with wine would have been okay but the staff were disinterested. food was posh so let feeling hungry. view was stunning except that they switched off the fountains. did not look at the art but went",
          "The approach to the museum is only fantastic \u2013 so worth the climb up the hill as you have a wonderful view of Barcelona, standing above amazing water fountains. Expect pushy sellers trying to get you to buy all sorts of things as you walk by. At one part of the steps there is a",
          "We went here on a Sunday only because we were near and it started raining however it was really good, we started with the modern art bit as that\u2019s what we\u2019re most interested in, that was all we got to look round in the end as we didn\u2019t realise it closed at 3pm, only downside was",
          "Even for those not interested in museums, this place is an artwork itself. The neobaroque structure dominates the Montjuic skyline and is very photogenic. The view of Barcelona from the terrace in front of the museum is also very nice.",
          "They curated these murals taken from churches in the Pyrenees in chapel like spaces. The colors in some of the wooden altar sides are breath taking. Very glad to take the time. Enjoy drinks on the Terrace in front of the museum - terrific view of Barcelona.",
          "The majestic building commands the skies from the distance. The sidewalks leading up to the building are lined with old world street lamps. Taking the multiple sets of steps up to the building can be daunting but have no fear, there are several outdoor escalators. And once",
          "Well worth a visit. great view of City . Great picture opportunity and close to Plac Espanya and shopping centre.",
          "I wanted to visit here for the building itself as much as seeing the exhibits. What they've done in terms of salvaging frescoes off church walls and repurposing them in the museum is amazing and that alone makes it worth a visit.",
          "After a climb up the hill and having the chance to enjoy the view over the city I decided to visit the museum. I guess I was luchy as on Saturdays after 15.00 the admission is free. The museum (beautiful building) is huge and you definitely need at least a few hours to see",
          "This museum is without doubt fantastic spent over 5 hours touring the immense collections of art and if you are over 65 you get in free even if not it is not expensive you will realy enjoy the experience",
          "It was an amazing experience when i visited this wonderful museum. The collection of art is outstanding. The ticket is valid for two days and true art lovers need two full days to see each art work. Don't miss it.",
          "We got there Saturday afternoon, after a walk through the Montjuic park, and the entrance was free. Beautiful building, outside and inside. Great photo opportunities in the front - a stunning view over the city. A lot of art to see. Wasn't crowded even though there were a lot of",
          "National Museum of Art which is situated in Montjuic Park on Montjuic hall is an architecture marvel. The view that you get from the terrace of this place is simply breathtaking. Although be careful about the hawkers selling duplicate football jerseys as at times they can be",
          "Hadn't been to an art museum in years and reviews were good. Enjoyed the Modern art much more than the Gothic and Renaissance which was largely depictions of religion. The Modern art section held some wooden carved pieces by Gaudi which were truly beautiful. We did not eat in",
          "We did not pay to see the art exhibitions. We did view all of Barcelona from a fantastic high point. The grounds and fountains are worthwhile. We also explored the interior of the palace built for the 1929 World Exposition - an impressive venue.",
          "Do not miss sitting in this elegant surrounding and dining on fresh ingredients while viewing the entirety of Barcelona. Learn about the history of Catalonia before or after. This is a short walk from the Foundacion Miro.",
          "Personally, I think you have one of the best views of BCN from here. Make sure you visit closer to the sunset as it creates that romantic, overwhelming feeling about the city. One of my favorite places in the world. Take your time here, sit on the stairs and just inhale",
          "It is a really nice museum, we liked our experience. I was surprised at how much art there we found and how diverse it was.",
          "This museum surprised me a bit. I had done considerable research on other museums I was going to on my trip to Spain, but had not researched this one as much as I wished I had. The collection is quite astounding. I only had 90 minutes here, and it wasn't nearly enough. The",
          "Collection spans centuries and is quite diverse. There is an emphasis on Catalan and Spanish artists, but there is much more there. Location of museum is also excellent\u2014 overlooking the whole town all the way to Sagrada Familia, right over Pla\u00e7a Espania, with cascades of",
          "The building was built in 1929. Enjoy the view from the front entrance. We saw the exhibit on medieval art. This was well curated, presenting the collection by theme rather than chronologically. The galleries are built into the original building and are very pleasant. We liked",
          "We had expected to spend about three hours at the Museum Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and were there for five before we began to tire. Our visit there was one of the highlights of Barcelona for us. The building and architecture alone are stunning even before you consider the",
          "The temporary William Morris exhibit drew us to this gallery and we were not disappointed. Seniors and teachers are admitted at no cost. Remember to take your professional identification. We didn't rent the audio guide but I think it would be beneficial when visiting the",
          "A definite must. It was out on the peripehry. Caught the bus from outside the university to Monjuic. Ask the bus driver where to get off, not easy to ascertain the bustop, there was a long wall, looked like a prison. Walk up on either side which will get you there. So worth the",
          "Magnificent building - just seeing that is enough. Great artworks. great views from there. Can get very busy",
          "Our ARticket was good here. Such a range of art! Interesting biblical art from a thousand years ago, plus a good helping of Gaudi. Some large spaces, perhaps for concerts? We made the mistake of eating a very expensive, not-good lunch. It was convenient. We took the",
          "I know Gaudi is important but there is so much more to Barcelona and Catalonia. This is a wonderful collection of art, beautifully displayed in a super building. The audio guide is well worth getting. This museum and the MEAM museum are highly recommended if you love art.",
          "The view of Barcelona from the steps of this beautiful building wa breathtaking. Your can stroll around the grounds in beautiful shaded tree.",
          "We loved this museum! The building itself is worth touring, not to mention the collections! The view from the top is outstanding! It\u2019s a beautiful building and an outstanding view!",
          "Worth it to get to the top just for the views on a good day. Don't be put off by the stairs as there are escalators to take you up & down.",
          "I had hoped to spend an hour or so, but it turned into almost five. A wonderful collection of modern art, and beautifully exhibited medieval and Romanesque art. Stayed for lunch, and had a lovely meal, with a stellar view. And ended by walking the roof and seeing the city.",
          "Situated above Plaza Espana and the old bullring from where you can walk up to the impressive building holding this art collection, aided by some escalators toward the top. You have to pay to get in (\u20ac12) but remember if you are a teacher and have teacher ID then it is free.",
          "We had a full day planned, so we chose to stop and take pictures outside rather than go in. The building is stunning and the views are fantastic! However, I feel we missed out on something more, so don't let your opportunity pass by.",
          "We had pencilled in this museum as the third museum we could visit using the Articket pass. We were open to dropping it, if something more interesting came along. We are so glad we visited. This turned out to be the museum we liked the most, trumping the Miro and Picasso",
          "The section with the romanic frescos from the Pyrenean churches is unique, never seen something like that in a museum, well worth a visit. They have rebuilt the interior of the Pyrenean churches in the museum and transferred the frescos there. The other section that I liked a",
          "Just love this place , take a leisurely stroll up or take the tourist bus which stops outside. Inside the art is stunning it's not over crowded it's lovely and cool inside if it's too hot outside. Take a seat on one of the benches outside and watch the buskers my favourite place",
          "We went yesterday and had to go back today to finish. This is a first rate museum with everything from Romanesque to Modern. There are 5 sections. We did Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance through Baroque one day and Modern Parts I and 2 the following day. When I looked it",
          "Great location with panoramic views of Barcelona. We used the 55 bus from central Barcelona to visit this and the Joan Miro museum together. Its a huge museum (former palace) and the paintings cover a wide range of eras from Romanesque to Modern. Well worth a visit if you have",

          "Excellent collection in a spectacular setting. Entry FREE for us oldies with proof of over 65 age. However, the museum cafe inside was dreadful. We settled for a soggy cheese salad sandwich and small still water between us for over 7 Euros. Most expensive in any museum",

          "The building is stunning, the art collection extensive - could have easily spend another 3 -4 hours there. If your budget can handle it - make lunch reservations at the restaurant Oleum in the museum. Off the chart views and food.",
          "I got free admission with my Barcelona Card. You get a ticket that is good for two separate days. This museum is definitely worth a visit. You also get a great view of Barcelona from the outdoor terrace of the museum. The museum is spacious and well-laid out on two floors.",
          "This was a complete surprise for me, as I hadn't done too much research on this particular attraction prior to arriving in Barcelona, but for me, an enthusiast of art, history, music and culture, this was as good as it got for me in Barcelona. The cathedrals were magnificent,",
          "You can't miss this museum, it is massive! Placed strategically with waterfalls and fountains all the way down to the bottom giving an incredible display it is something not to be missed! The range of art inside is extensive, and the rooms flow from one to another making sure",

          "We came here to see the Magic fountain, which didn't work. Instead we had a great walk to the museum and around. Never been inside as I'm not a big fun of art and it was late night but deffinetly worth it to just come here for a walk",

          "What a gem. The building & its location alone are a joy to the eye. What foresight from the city to build such a wonderful monument to the arts. The Modern art section is brilliantly curated with a wonderful cross-section of all the fine arts. The Gothic section beggars belief",
          "What a surprising experience at the top of Parc de Montjuic! This collection of Catalonian art can hold its own with many of the world\u2019s better known museums in quality, display and style. From medieval works to Dali, visitors can enjoy hundreds of works in a setting that",
          "Our first meal in Barcelona was a private event in the dining room of this Museum. The skylight, design and view were a treat and the food was very good. The museum has some very interesting historical exhibits and features a great design as well.",

          "Wonderfull building which contains a multitude of art from all genres , we were there in Oct 2019 and they had closed off the 1st floor for some work so we couldnt access the modernist area but the rest of the museum was full of interesting \u2026",
          "It's far from the city, so you can go by the public transport or a taxi. The good point is that there are many elevators instead of the stairs.",
          "This fascinating gallery and museum is a wonderful place to visit. The art is top class and very well presented. The staff were helpful and informative. We paid for the audio guide which was well worth it. The views were impressive and the building alone a worthwhile trip.",
          "I can only speak of the grounds and the exterior of the museum as it\u2019s closed on Monday when we visit. \n\nIt\u2019s got the best view of Barca you can get and it\u2019s free :) \n\nLovely walk down the garden and the stair cases in the immediate area. Well worth a visit for the view alone.",
          "It's a must in Barcelona. The building is amazing and the garden as well, you will enjoy it. This museum has a  great collection of romanic art from Catalunya. They offer artistic activities on weekends just look the website. Subway station \"Plaza Espa\u00f1a\"",

          "One of the most beautiful places i have ever been. simply magnificent.",
          "Great building and the inside is huge and I can only assume any events that are performed are what people go to see. Not for me. Not a lot of art about and what I saw was photographs of pictures. Will go back but just for the views",

          "A fabulous place to visit. Some incredible art and history to explore. The installations were excellent and the ancient chapel reconstructions  were particularly impressive. It's not all about fine paintings. Most impressive of all was the \u2026",

          "This is a top class museum, with an impressive collection that is presented beautifully. The building itself, with views of the city, is well worth visiting but the museum is very special with things worth seeing from across the ages. It doesn't have to take as long to visit as some seem to suggest..",

          "Exceptional exhibitions that require thought and reward the time spent considering the different themes and the evolution of techniques and approaches. Essential.",
          "One of the best regional museums Ive ever been to. Organized by time periods from medieval to post modern. Very interesting collection. I learned a lof. Both floors can be seen in one afternoon but its a lot to take in. Also the building and surrounding area is beautiful as well.",

          "The museum does a good job of moving you through history. Particularly liked the section with modernisme",
          "Beautiful view. Hard to find a passage to the roof, but ask arround. It's worth seeing all of Barcelona from it.\nMuseums are too oriented toward pictures, which I personally find borring. Very few historic art items displayed. Historic pictures mostly lacked any description or context. I'll just ignore the museum part of it.",

          "Lot\u00b4s of things to see \nNice building",

          "This was a pretty good museum. A little redundant walk pattern in my opinion. They had some really cool prints but 2 rows were tucked away almost hidden. Luckily we discovered them and found the wave. I liked the sculptures the best. They do have a small cafe, but I'd eat before or after honestly.",
          "Forget the Museum and visit its surroundings: water fountains,  excellent views to Barcelona  and beautiful gardens.",
          "Great collection of Catalan art. Beautiful place. With an amazing terasse view.",

          "Free entrance fee and enjoy seeing Romanesque art and Gothic art",
          "The layout was good and they hand out maps at the door so you don't miss a thing. I will say the view of Barcelona was alone a great reason to go despite the street market sellers occasional badgering.",
          "A very good place for art lovers",
          "Amazing place. Definitely a place to see. Saturdays after 3 pm entree free!",

          "Museum requires you to wear your bag on your front. No drinks or food should be seen by the guards at any time. Excellent building, plan to spend a lot of time on the balcony outfront. There is a small cafe inside but 2.50 euros for 300ml \u2026",
          "Fantastic collection if you are interested in medieval wall-paintings, which fill half of the ground floor. Nice views over the city.",
          "The focus on Catalinan artists gives the museum a nice focus. The way you can walk through multiple periods gives a great sense of development and clear context. The Romanesque and Gothic sections are particularly note worthy.",
          "Wonderful place to visit, for 3 more hours, worth every minute.",
          "I loved this museum and could spend hours in there! It has a surprisingly large collection of art and artifacts so it's definitely a whole day affair if you're interested in museums.

          "Very tremendous next to the very beautiful park",

          "Worth the climb up the hill to Museu and botanical gardens then Olympic stadium behind little evidence of former F1 and motorcycle circuit though.",
          "Funny that the fountains are open in certain time. I believe is more beautiful to visit in the night because of lights around. We missed the fountains.",

        "wiki": "The Poble Espanyol (literally, Spanish town) is an open-air architectural museum in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, approximately 400 metres away from the Fountains of Montju\u00efc. Built for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the museum consists of 117 full-scale buildings, which recreate Spanish villages. It also contains a theater, restaurants, artisan workshops and a museum of contemporary art.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was built for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition as an exhibit of the architecture and culture of Spain. The idea was promoted by the Catalan architect Puig Cadafalch and the project was realized by architects Francesc Folguera and Ramon Revent\u00f3s, art critic Miquel Utrillo and painter Xavier Nogu\u00e9s. The four professionals visited over 600,000 sites in Spain to collect the architecture to bring together the main characteristics of the peoples of Spain.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Areas ===\nThe Poble Espanyol has replications of 117 buildings representing fifteen autonomous communities of Spain \u2212 Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Catalonia, the Valencian Community, Extremadura, Galicia, the Baleric Islands, the Community of Madrid, the Region of Murcia, Navarre, and the Basque Country. The autonomous communities of La Rioja and the Canary Islands are not represented. The first is not present because it was not a separate region of Spain when the museum was designed and built. The Canary Islands are not represented because the four designers could not travel to them for economic reasons.\n\n\n=== Monuments and buildings of the Poble Espanyol ===\nReplicated buildings include:\n\n\n=== Other exhibits and attractions ===\nAlthough the Poble Espanyol was planned to be demolished when the International Exhibition was over, the museum was preserved because of its great success. The recreated village still contains the streets, squares and facades of the different areas of Spain. The village hosts many different events including gastronomic festivals, concerts in summer, flamenco shows, private events such as weddings, and children's activities.\nThe Poble Espanyol exhibits more than 30 artisans who regularly work within the village making blown glass, leather, ceramics, jewelry, masks, baskets, and Spanish guitars. They create handmade items which are sold to the visitors.\nThe Poble Espanyol also contains rides, stores with gourmet products, and restaurants or bars with cuisine from the different regions of Spain.\n\n\n=== Museum Fran Daurel ===\nThe museum Fran Daurel is situated within the Poble Espanyol. It is a private collection open to the public featuring over 295 works of contemporary Spanish artists including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Joan Mir\u00f3, Antoni T\u00e0pies, Barcel\u00f3, Josep Guinovart and Amat. The museum holds paintings, sculptures, tapestries, drawings and ceramics, and a sculpture garden, with 41 large sculptures. The works by Picasso include ceramics from the 1950s and 1960s, where he used both traditional techniques and his own methods. \n\n\n=== Theater ===\nThe Poble Espanyol has a theater that regularly organizes entertainment for children: theater, dance, music, clowns or puppets. The Barcelona School of Theatre also performs at this theater.\n\n\n=== Tablao de Carmen ===\nThe Tablao de Carmen was opened in 1988 as an homage to the great dancer Carmen Amaya. The venue is located in the heart of Poble Espanyol, in the same place, where she danced for the King of Spain Alfonso XIII during the opening of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. Nowadays the Tablao de Carmen is a popular flamenco theatre-restaurant, offering its visitors one of the best flamenco shows in Barcelona, accompanied by a delicious tapas menu. Tablao de Carmen displays some of the photo legacy of Carmen Amaya. On special occasions visitors can hear the guitar of her husband Juan Antonio Ag\u00fcero (by Santos Hern\u00e1ndez 1930), which is a part of the patrimony of the founder family of Tablao de Carmen.\n\n\n=== Activities for children ===\nIn addition to shows that take place every week in the theatre, Poble Espanyol has other activities for children: workshops (every Sunday morning), TOT Puppet Festival (March), living nativity scenes during Christmas, and family shows throughout the year (such as Carnivals, Santa Eul\u00e0lia, Fiesta Mayor, and Festival La Merc\u00e8).\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDavey, J.; Zhen, C.

          "In this mini Spanish village you will learn a lot about Spanish history, culture, heritage and architecture- especially if you take the audio guide- like we did. There are loads of boutiques selling crafts, jewellery, linen, glass, silver ,a leather workshop etc. Made in",
          "You can get a general picture of Spain only visiting one place. During your visit you can watch films of Northern, Southern, Central and Mediterranean part of Spain. You'll find restaurants of typical food and gift shops. I think it worth the visit if you're not resident in",
          "The current pictures posted on their website are misleading i.e. they are not from the most recent year, but probably from the best year. December 31, 2017 11:00pm: total of 4 people on the podium standing(not dancing)- see photo 1 11:30pm: total of 10 people on the podium",

          "A lovely place to spend an afternoon with kids in Barcelona! It is for sure touristy, but maybe because we visited in an off season, it seemed like it was ours to explore and take in. Very well designed, with educational displays representing different parts of beautiful Spain.",
          "This is a sort of history park, constructed in the early 20th C for a world expo to represent various iconic buildings in Spain. For us, the value was the range of artisan shops, many with the artisans working while you watch. This was part of a tour so we did it. But I would",

          "A great place where you can see a country in just a couple of hours! Different streets show you specific architecture of some areas in Spain. A little bit too comercial as there are too many shops. Very interesting the glass workshop where you can see how the glass objects are",
          "If you have time whilst in the city go and visit this area that celebrates the architecrture of the country. They have reconstructed houses and buildings from around the country in the open-air museum. I Highly recommend it.",
          "This is such a weird place. You pay an exhorbitant entrance fee to begin with. There is a rather limited audioguide to the buildings which are carefully arranged according to their geographic locations in Spanish regions. OK so far. But the rest of the place is just an expensive",
          "We stopped off here on the Hop on hop off, West route, bus. Originally built for an exhibition, and was due to be demolished after the event. However due to local objections it was decided to maintain it as a working tourist attraction. We got there at about 10am. This is a",

          "Just to get it out of the way I agree with other reviewers that the price is on the high side. That said I love Poble Espanyol and it's great to spend a few hours wandering round seeing all the different arts and crafts from all around Spain. From glass blowing to guitar making",
          "It's a replica of different building styles across Spain. Some have workshops in them, most have tourist junk shops or overpriced food and drink. The audio video guide is really hard to follow and without headphones is difficult to hear in the public places and difficult to see",

          "We visited in early March, and had bought tickets for the flamenco show in the area that evening which included the entrance to the town. I found the statues near the entrance a little off putting, but once past them, I found it a thoroughly charming town. We went into one of",
          "I've been here a couple of times before and it's always good. A collection of craft shops and restaurants housed in buildings which have been designed tor reflect the various architectural styles around Spain. It's a bit of a hike but there is a funicular which links to the",
          "I enjoyed visiting Poble Espanyol, walking the streets and looking at the Spanish architecture, contemporary art and live handcrafting. I've never been to an open air museum before so this was a nice change. The restaurants and cafes are really nice too but i do agree with a",
          "Visited Poble Espanyol last week & the weather was beautiful - blue skies & sunshine. Thought the place was delightful if a little twee. Enjoyed watching various artisans at work - the glassblower & guitar maker especially. Also the modern art gallery. BUT... what should have",
          "I usually don't leave reviews... but this i have to review on only because it's rubbish, all souvenirs shops and u have to pay to get in -- euro 14 .. for what.. nothing a walk that finishes in 30 mins at most. also they had a electric lunch event and blocked out half the area",
          "Finally Poble Espanyol is a kind of amusement park and not an architectural collection or an open air museum of the Spanish architecture. I think most people are looking at like just like an amusement park. Partly accesible to hanticap persons.",
          "This park reminds me of a low-tech predecessor to Disney\u2019s EPCOT center. Here every part of Spain is represented in architecture and shops and food places that maintain the theme of each region. Along the way there are some great artworks, and on weekends (I was there on a",
          "I was surprised at the number of reviewers who were disappointed with the Poble Espanyol. I understand some of the criticisms; although it is an included stop on the HOHO bus (which is how I got there) getting there by foot from the centre of town would certainly be a trek,",
          "On Monday afternoon when we visited this place it was almost empty and many of the houses were closed. Without an audioguide it would have been a disappointment, now one learned about various parts and houses of the country. Our first thoughts were that they want you to buy a",
          "In a warm day of september I vizited this place and I didn't regret at all. After a few days walking from museum to museum to visit and to see all the interesting places from Barcelona, I founded this quiet and peaceful place. Here you can find a lot of local craftmen and you",
          "They charge you to go in and buy more stuff. It was dead empty when we went and it was extremely disappointing. If I could get my money back, I most certainly would. Don't waste your time or money unless you want to buy direct from the artisans.",
          "I was really disappointed in this. The people at the hotel told us about this. It cost us $14 a person to get in and was basically shopping. It was quite a distance from our hotel so quite a bit in taxi fare to get to and from there. It is a \"museum\" of the various",
          "Spent a few hours walking through the streets, browsing the shops and enjoying lunch in one of the cafes. A nice place to visit if you are only visiting Spain for the first time. Otherwise of course you can see everything that's inside the park, outside the park in the various",

          "We went there on the recommendation of a friend, and let me tell you, we probably won't speak to that friend again :-) First off, google maps told us it was a 30 min walk from our hotel on the Rambla. More like 2 hours (granted we had 2 toddlers in tow). It's all uphill, and",
          "14\u20ac entry fee. Total rip off. Nothing worth seeing - a few overpriced cafes. You can get a coffee in a Barcelona Street for free. Don't waste your time and effort going here.",
          "This place is great and shows the different architecture used throughout Spain. It was created back in 1929 for the Barcelona Internationl Exhibition when they apparently built the place in 16 months. Funny how Sagrada Familia is still under construction one might think. The",
          "Commercial with some historic touch. It was rainy people were friendly we recommend it in sunny days",
          "Visited at the end of feb - obviously in the off season as a lot of the shops etc were closed. All a bit plastic and overpriced for my liking and at a cost of \u20ac48 for a family of 4 I definitely wouldn't be recommending or returning .",
          "A small town made of copies from other towns all over Spain. The end result is a sort of Spanish Disneyland, complete with inflated prices and fake looking buildings, but with none of the magic. As if that wasn't enough, it's expensive as well. Completely dispensable unless",
          "Beautiful place to walk and see the different styles and cultures of Spain in one place. It's a tourists place, so it's not cheap to shop and dine. But it's a good place to spend good time. A small tip if you are planning to eat or attend any activity inside, you can get free",
          "Spent the afternoon walking around the area, gratefully had a lot of things set up for small children to do. Small shops were nice though highly priced.",
          "Under the roofs, towers and facades, guided by a badly synchronised video provided on a hand held tablet, one travels around \"mini-Spain\" visiting the boutiques of crafters selling their home made wares alongside the latest FC Barcelona merchandise. We arrived on the Red Route",
          "If you go to Barcelona you must see Spanish Village. That's awesome. Spanish Village - the whole Spain in one place. At this one place you can imagine that you are going around the whole Spain. One of the best place in Barcelona.",
          "This place was recommended to us. It's off the beaten track, not well publicised and a little more expensive than you'd think. When you first go in you wonder why you bothered! The initial exhibits are not very inspiring. But...as you start to wander down the little alley ways",
          "I was there with my boyfriend today and I was disappointed. We spent 24 Euro together and it was not worth it. For a start we got a flayer saying that there is some free food sampling there and that was misleading. Many buildings were in renovation and were covered and many were",
          "It cost 14 euros per adult & we took 25 minutes to walk around the whole place including a visit to the toilets. You are effectively paying to visit a load of tourist shops, bars & restaurants, half of which were closed. Go to the gothic quarter instead & you can walk round",
          "Now where to start with this place! It's certainly different. Up in the hills near the olympic stadium this little self-contained village is a cross between the town in chitty chitty bang bang and the village of the damned! It about 13 euros each to get in. It was very quiet on",
          "This complex gives a great experience of the architecture and layout of the areas of Spain with many interesting buildings and lots of information with artisan shops.",
          "Had a great new years eve here. Very handy as its located right me to the main new years attraction. Could head straight there after the fireworks. No ques or hassle great DJ and good value",
          "We were here in the evening and we visited the museum for a little time. It looked quite interesting, so me and my friend decided to go back during the day to have a closer look. The place is interesting, it has all king of buildings and is quite peacefully and quiet. We loved",
          "We celebrated here on new years eve and it was rather disappointing. There was no information on the website that it will be an outside party with only one location to be. The music was quite caotic, the DJ wasn't mixing the songs just playing 50 seconds from one and then",
          "It was an interesting excursion inside the city bit away from it all. A great place to eat and relax and look at the shops which had both typical tourist stuff and interesting hand made crafts. Lits to photograph.",
          "Now I am not so into these tourist traps per say, but I really don't see this place as so much as a tourist place, as its form the 1920's, but more of a great place to potter, have a coffee, explore genuine handicrafts and art done live on site with great access to items that",
          "Extraordinary exhibits about the village, with antique shops and excellent blacksmith shop, available to watch. Would definitely recommend",
          "We went to visit Pueblo Espanol in the evening, after 7 pm.It is a wonderful place ,full of colours, traditional architecture, history and culture. Paintig museums, crafts shops of all kinds and spanish village streets.Planty flowers too. Many places to eat for all budgets.",
          "We had a visit in Poble Espanyol, the museum is empty but is low season.... A lot of place are close and the entrance fee is the same. Very nice restaurant, we had a lunch in Plaza Mayor Albi restaurant, is nice fresh food and good price.",
          "We hopped off the bus and paid a visit here. There is lots of little stalls selling local produce and products. When we visited it was a mixture of everyday things mixed with an Xmas theme. A must is the wine, cheese and ham & sausage tasting. The local Herb liqueur is lovely",
          "Considering that the normal entry is not cheap (13\u20ac), going for the reduced price visit from 8pm could be the option to go for. And it was the right one, as it was peaceful and beautifully lighted. I had the whole place to enjoy almost by myself, and even on a Saturday evening.",
          "Poble Espanyol was recommended to us by a local. When we got to visit, we saw the different types of architecture from various regions of Spain. The only drawback to this is that it is commercialized and all these buildings house shops that sell all kinds of tourist items.",
          "I went here i the evening with some friends and I found it very interestings. There weren't many people so I thought that it's because it's too late. Me and my boyfriend have return to take a closer look in daylight. It is interesting, as I mentioned, but there are few things",
          "If you have visited other regions of Spain, then this rather tired collection of mock buildings-expensive to visit- will be a disappointment. We had time to spare so came here with an open mind, toiled up the hill from the Placa de Espanya, paid over a considerable sum of money",
          "Poble Espanyol encapsulates the various architectures, cultures, history, handicraft, et al of the various regions in Spain. Those with an interest in history should definitely consider visiting. It was an educative experience for us, including my 9 year old.",

          "A delightful afternoon and evening outing. \"One-stop education\" on the history of Spanish architecture. Life size exhibitions of the buildings and churches and what influenced the styles. Probably not one of the top 10 things to see and do in Barcelona but we were here for 5",
          "The Poble Espanyol is in Montjuich, but if you are walking there from the top of the funicular you have to walk all round it to get to the entrance - probably better to walk up from Plaza de Espana. Entry is EUR13, which is good value given how much there is to see inside - we",
          "There are many great places to visit and sights to see in Barcelona... This isn't one of them. I took my Dad here today whilst on our city break after seeing lots of great reviews on trip advisor. Both me and my Dad were really disappointed with this place. It was overpriced,",
          "This amazing village of authentic and reconstructed catalonian archetechture through the ages is very informative and beautiful, and there are lots of shops and food places right inside. Very close to the paace gallery and the Font Magica which is Barcelona's must see",
          "We visited here as part of our hop-on/hop-off tour of Barcelona. This site was part of the International Expo in 1929 and houses replicas of buildings from different spanish regions. There are artisans producing leather, ceramics, jewellery and other articles for sale, as well",
          "Visted this place with the family and we all enjoyed the shops, local artisans and the site overall. Found really interesting the glass blowing demonstration , how he doe's a water pitcher so quick is amazing !!",
          "This site was part of the Interantional Expo in 1929 which houses replicas of buildings through the years from different spanish regions. It also houses the Fran Daurel Museum including works by Picasso, Dali, Miro and other spanish contemporary artists. There are artisans",
          "We visited as part of a tour of the city. Really impressed that Spain has kept this site in such good condition for so long. Expo 1928 I believe was the founding date of the site and what an amazing idea to take eye catching traditional buildings from different regions of the",
          "I felt very well in this place, didn't seem so much from outside but than we decided after all to enter for our children. It was really quiet inside, a good pause from crowdy places of Barcelona. You can have a nice walk, admire buildings from all Spain and read about each",
          "My 3 children, wife and I booked online for the \"Halloween spectacular\" wished we would have stayed at home. Ive lived in Barcelona for 15 years and work as a professional tourist guide and I have never been so ashamed of an event in Barcelona. Bad directions as to how enter",
          "I absolutely love this place unfortunately from the outside it doesn't look much and as we went past in the bus we chose not to get off. Big mistake!! Luckily we had a flamenco night booked the next night which happened to be in here, we were allowed access free of charge after",
          "May be worth it at half the price. Paying to see poor reproductions, shop and eat. Food expensive and tourist trap.",
          "Loved the architecture of the different regions. Great photo opportunities here. Nice atmosphere, it wasn't too busy during the week. Spent a good couple of hours wandering around. Watched a bit of glass blowing by a man making very commercial objects to sell. Nice leather shops",
          "Just a small \"village\" with expensive shops,some streets and restaurants...just like all villages...",
          "Visited and after paying \u20ac49 for 3 adults and a student we entered to be told one of the attractions was closed that day. Then whilst wandering around I would estimate around 15 to 20% of the buildings were closed. In my opinion I feel we should have been advised beforehand and",
          "It is a turistic center in which Spanish culture and the different architecture types of each region are represented. It is filled by so many details. It is also a very peaceful place to take a comfortably walk and enjoy a family time. There are a lot of restaurant options",
          "Spent a couple of hours wandering round here and would have spent longer but for the coach loads of very excited small children that arrived! It was a fascinating look at the history of the architecture of Spain and I thought it was very well laid out. The small artisan shops",
          "The place is beautiful if you like taking pictures. There are restaurants cafes in it. You can sit and enjoy the calmness. We had our lunch there it was ok.",
          "I would have been happier to pay them to leave the place rather than pay to enter. A total waste of money and still wonder what the point of the place is. It is not as described. We saw no flamenco, there were no crafts at all and definitely none that we could join in with as",
          "A lovely park to walk through with plenty to see. We enjoyed watching the glass blowers and the ornaments were being sold in the shop and were very reasonably priced. There were plenty of shops and cafes around but unfortunately as we visited early most of them were closed,",
          "I absolutely love this place. It is really relaxing to sit in the square and have lunch. I have been to several of the restaurants and they are all of a good standard. The prices are reasonable and the service is very good. Then stroll around the craft shops. You will be able to",
          "There are many must-see places in Barcelona, some very famous, some less known, like this one. I have been before a few times in Barcelona, but only now i visited this wonderful place! It is a great experience, it is like an old city center surrounded by buildings typical for",
          "The original village was built for a world trade fair. It represents the architecture of all the regions of Spain and has plenty of restaurants and craft shops to tempt you. A large town square in the middle full of school children enjoying their time there when I visited, but",
          "I wouldn't go here to be honest the place is very fake and lifeless, it's over priced and nothing to see really if you want a feel for a real spanish town, head into the heart of barcelona wander it's streets. They talk about artisan workshops and gift shops aswell ..... nothing",
          "This is one of my absolutely favorite places in Barcelona. Unfortunately, we got there quite late in the evening and some of the places of interest were already closed, but we really didn't care. My first impression as soon as we stepped in was that we were back in time and I",
          "A wonderful park which is actually a village of all types of Spanish architecture, away from the noise of traffic, it is a peaceful 'wander around Spain'. Beautiful buildings which house artists/craftspeople's studios and shops. So much to see and lots of cafes and restaurants",
          "This place is amazing. Lots of different buildings from around Spain - so you get a feel for the diversity in architecture of this country. There were lots of \"tours\" going round at the same time but they were easy to avoid and enabled me to explore these architectual gems. It",
          "Went here for dinner in a group and that's how we get to waive the entrance fee. I don't think anyone else would come here and pay to get in - the architectures were great, but you don't need to come here to see them. There are plenty of them in Barcelona city itself. The whole",
          "You MUST, MUST, MUST go to this Spanish Village. Its a world all of its own, with wonderful shops, streets and little cafes at every turn. Its also surprisingly quiet. We found a few lovely souvenirs for family to bring back from here, without actually going shopping for",
          "I was reading the review on Google first and that is almost put us off visiting this place. The entry fee is a bit pricey but still worth it (by the way you can pick up a 2 for 1 voucher in the McDonalds). There is a lot to see. We really enjoyed the art gallery, which took",
          "The Spanish village is a very nice place to eat nice restaurants nice shops shame when I went that not all shops were open nice buildings to take photos a nice art gallery would recommend the Spanish village",
          "A village of buildings, set out in areas in the style of different parts of Spain. Some lovely architecture. Entry was \u20ac13 each, which would have been ok, except that many of the shops, workshops and buildings were closed. Disappointing and frustrating as many of them looked",
          "We came across this attraction when we did the bus tour around the city. We decided to take a tour round it and was very surprised at how good it was. There are lots of buildings to see, exhibitions, galleries, shops and cafe's. Spend a full morning here and although there were",
          "We got off here on our hop on hop off bus tour and looked an interesting place. We were surprised the entry fee was 10\u20ac per person which was discounted because of the bus tour. It was quant with artisanal arts and crafts. There was a Mexican festival happening in the town square",
          "Visited with my wife and kids, paid 46 euros to see a bunch of shops! Really not recommended. Complete waste of money and time. And gave the kids a great opportunity to moan at there mum for her choice",
          "Very good place to see the difference on types of building across spain (andalucia, Madrid and barcelona) The restaurants are also good and very good prices (in comparison to rambla s restaurants) Worth a visit if you want to see all spain and have no time",
          "Expensive to enter, and not much of interest. I expected to see craftspeople at work, but there was only a glassblowing studio. Lame little shops.",
          "Interesting attraction providing examples of architecture from different regions of Spain. A great place to stroll around to view the interesting buildings, many of which are used as specialist craft shops, restaurants, cafes or souvenir shops. We ate lunch at Tapes Tapas and",
          "Go here for the houses and outdoor activities. The cafes and small shops you can find better in town. One great thing though was Fundaci\u00f3n Fran Daurel which is a gallery of art owned by Francisco Daurella and opened to the public by this private collector. Dal\u00ed, Miro and Picasso",
          "If you want to see a snap-shot of the various regions or provinces, their cultures, and architecture in Spain then this is an OK place but its nothing special. We went only to seem the flamenco show at El Tablao de Carmen which is located inside the village. Entry to the village",
          "Architectural recreations of the different Spanish villages from the past are what you can expect entering here. There is an entrance fee , covered with our tour package . Feeling disappointed we did not see the Magic Fountain at work earlier , only to get the more sentiment",
          "This site is a re creation of architecture and culture from all different provinces of Spain. Some mediocre restaurants and shops cater exclusively to tourists and overcharge. Reasonably quaint and informative it is overpriced and would not be viable without the tour buses,",
          "This was very disappointing, we went with 2 children following recommendations from the lonely planet guide. It was 36 euros for a family ticket to basically walk round shops and restaurants in the style of different Spanish regions! There was a significant number closed and the",
          "A very interesting few hours were spent in Poble Espanyol, here you can see replicas of all the architecture of all the regions of Spain. There are great views of the city, lovely little shops, bars and restaurants which are surprisingly well priced. There's even a glass works",

          "Well worth a visit. If you get the tourist bus here you get entry at a discount. Enjoyed a excellent menu del dia in the first restaurant you come to on the far left in the main courtyard or square. If you are interested in Spanish architectural influences and the Spanish",
          "Nice place representing different towns from Spain, maybe would be better to go on weekends, we were visiting on a Tuesday and was kind of empty.. But must admit that was a nice experience specially for the kids!",
          "We were looking forward to this visit but were ultimately disappointed. We were charged 13 euros each for entry and an additional 3 euros each for audio which you had to collect at another outlet. Since we didn't have our passports or driving licences with us, this because of",
          "Went to flamenco - tablao de carmen, in this magnificent splendid park that we were totally unaware of beforehand. It was built for a world exhibition in 1929 and is certainly world class even today, so we are going back again tomorrow. Flamenco was awesome - so full of emotion",
          "If you do not have time to visit the entire Spain, this little village will give you an idea of architectures and culture of different parts of Spain. It is very close to magic fountain and MNAC, so if you have time, you may want to check it out. We brought the promotion tickets",
          "spent an afternoon here wandering in and out of the quaint old style streets and shops lovely to see craftsmen actually in their workshop making,guitars,leather goods,glass blowing and painting,its like a small enclosed village back in old spain.",
          "This is a great place to visit if you don't get the chance to visit many other cities in Spain. It has great replicas of the different architectural styles throughout different regions in Spain.",
          "Poble Espanyol, situated on the hill close to the Olympic stadium, Palau Sant Jordi, Palau Nacional and Montjuic is worth the visit - it is a reproduction of various Spanish areas / buildings, and has an authentic feel. There are a number of artesinal shops ( deli / foodstuffs,",
          "I had read that Poble Espanyol is a lively vibrant area for the evening with live music, bars and restaurants. As entry is 7 euro after 6 I thought it would be really good to see the architecture lit up and enjoy some food and a few drinks. We got there around 8 and were charged",
          "Poble Espanyol is a sort of idealised village incorporating architectural elements from all around Spain. On the positive side, it is extremely pretty and pleasant to walk around; it offers numerous bars, cafes and restaurants and opportunities to but souvenirs. The cynic in me,",
          "This is very nice to visit for half a day. The buildings there are really awesome, lots of great shops, small restaurants and cafes. And the views are splendid. Easy to reach, bought the tickets online, highly recommend the place!",
          "We spent a nice few hours wandering around the Poble Espanyol. There appeared to be a lot going on in the evening. We went to El Carmen to watch flamenco, but there was also a live band playing outside the church. We also ate at two of the restaurants and a cafe, all of which",
          "If you are interested in Spanish architecture, history and geography, this is an attraction for you. The houses from whole Spain await you, all with a description and location. The entry fee surprised me, and I have to say it's quite high (over 10e).",
          "It's sort of like a miniature Spain, with architecture from all over the country that was fun to look at. Definitely overpriced to get in. One of us really liked it for some reason. We grabbed some cake at a place called casa de chocolat that was good but not fantastic.",
          "Okay, I loved this place, but then I love the variety of styles that make up Spanish architectural design. This is a reproduction \"village\" (poble) that displays the various styles of the different regions of Spain. So, for example, there is the Andalusian area, painted white",
          "Its basically a small reproduction of some areas in Spain, with some little local stores. I would say this is somewhat a good place to go for a lunch or dinner, and then a little walk around, but be aware there's an entrance fee of EU13. I went on Saturday morning and there",
          "We went on Friday as part of our tour. The only other people on site were the marchants/employees and tourists from other tours. It is surprising there is a fee to get in as the sole purpose is to spend money. The shops were pleasant with nice selection, however, if you wish for",
          "Not worth the time unless there is a special event being hosted there. I was there Sunday evening at 7pm. No special event other than a private party being held in one section. I was still charged full price even though the Picasso (small) museum was closing soon and 70% of the",
          "While the boutiques/cafes and the scenery are nice there is nothing authentic about it when only tourists are there. Charging an entrance fee to go shopping or to eat?? C'mon really?!?! You are better off going to gothic quarter or ramblas.",
          "Poble Espanyol is a village that was built years ago for a Barcelona International Expo and I am advised that it was supposed to be dismantled after the expo, but thankfully that did happen for it is a wonderful place to visit and to get an idea of some of the many communities",
          "An amazing place, beautiful and interesting trip. Shops, cafes, an atmosphere of fun and a lot of joy! Highly recommended to visit!",
          "I spent the afternoon wandering through the village admiring the architectural details and strolling through the many shops. There are so many restaurants to choose from making it hard to decide. Will definitely be going again.",
          "Visited early to beat the crowds but many attractions inside were not open. Beautiful architecture, however spoiled by many large signs. Failed to inspire us, and cafes overpriced.",
          "This place was a huge disappointment on our trip. The entrance fee was 13 euros. And what you get in return is a fake Spanish village with a bunch of overpriced stores. This place would work great in the US as it's in the new continent and places like this are common to attract",
          "A mish-mash of second rate replicas of architectural styles across Spain. Filled with sub rate gift shops and restaurants. Don't bother with it.",
          "We stopped off her on the way down from Montjuic on the way to Font Magica. It was about 6pm so we expected it to be bustling like the rest of the city but it was deserted. Quite a lot of the shops were closed and the restaurants (those that had bothered to open) were mostly",
          "We went in d afternoon.. it was very beautiful village.. the creations are amazing.. loved the traditional shops.. people were making things in front of us..",
          "It is nicely placed as per spanish tradici\u00f3n and maintained properly. I recomend it to visit it once who visitas to Barcelona. It gives a tradicional and Pleasant visit.",
          "Not bad at all. There are some interesting buildings (replicas of some historic buildings) to see. However, it is a little bit expensive for such a thing.",
          "This place was a disappointment. We visited because we were waiting for the Magic Fountain to start and noticed it was still open. We paid thankfully only half price (7 EUR) since it was already late. But even for this price I feel there was no point to the place. It felt very",

          "Nice and clean area but a bit small for the price \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac considering that you're gonna buy or eat inside. I expected more. Try to go when they do some event, to make the experience more interesting.",
          "Very enjoyable place to be...Different sort of location within 1 compound area. The buildings are beautiful n lot of thing to buy and see. Lots if souveniers for friends and love ones.",
          "Went in the early evening and many of the shops and artisan demos were already closed but it was a nice stroll admiring the buildings. I'm sure it would be much more interesting in the daytime.",
          "Totally loved this place. So much history to see. Definitely recommend to have a look at it if you're visiting Barcelona! Architecture, shops, food and amazing experiences.",
          "Entrance tickets are pretty steep at \u20ac14 per adult. Incase  you have no problems to walk, you should do so from Placa Espanya. Another  access is to take the step and escalator approach to MNAC from Espanya  and then walk to Poble Espanyol. \u2026",
          "Such a cool place which is like a tour of Spain in an afternoon...you'll need a couple of hours if you intend to listen to the whole audio guide",
          "Honestly I just go there for the parties (Terrrazza / Upload / Input).",
          "Unexpected interesting excursion: all Spanish regions with their architecture, landscape, food, history and traditions. Highly recommended!",
          "Beautiful place with lots of historical significance A must visit place while in Barcelona.",
          "For anyone with the slightest interest in architecture, Spanish food, gifts or modern art this is an excellent taster.",
          "Nice place but hardly anything open and certainly no Artisans working, would be better if had not been charged for only a half hearted offering",
          "I went here to see an exhibition and as a result I would definitely love to come again and explore the streets. Very authentic miniature replicas of the most famous cities in Spain. Its a place to have a wonder and visit the different \u2026",
          "Great place to take a walk and relax. It's cute, has lots of shops and bars and looks like a typical Spanish village.",
          "Not the place for you if you want an authentic small town experience, but hey - this place is made for tourists. If you only have a short time in Spain/Barcelona this place will give you the sense of what the country looks like else where. \u2026",
          "A little overpriced but it's a good way to see some typical architecture of the various areas of Spain. Nice to walk around for a couple of hours.",
          "This was... Correct. I was there for the New Years' Eve. To be honest:\n\nGood points: for 45 euros, you get 4 drinks and full access to the village. The drinks come full of alcohol so it's cool. The village is beautiful and the dancefloor is \u2026",
          "Overrated, good for walking around but was below my expectations. Some good boys, but they should make it a lot better.",
          "Nice place. Really good to go",
          "Amazing 'village' offering various architectural styles from all over the country. When we were there, it was not crowded at all so we could easily stroll around, browse through the small shops all over the place, have a cool drink and \u2026",
          "Beautiful 'Spanish style village' to visit. It was fairly quiet when I visited and very peaceful. A stark contrast compared to our Camp Nou visit and Barcelona City. I would recommend you visit here if you want a break from the rat race of Barcelona.",
          "I had the bad luck to be here on 1st November when there is helloween festival. This park is simply not designed for so many people. I had to wait more than one hour just to eat. Couldn't see almost anything. Kids everywhere running and \u2026",
          "Maybe in summer it's worth seeing but in late autumn it was absolutely empty and abandoned. You definitely shouldn't spend money on it",
          "The artisan's had really nice products. All unique and tasteful.Lots of places to eat. A visual story of architectural styles replicated in one consice area. Nice place to have a look at.",
          "Really nice little town with great architecture. However I feel without a guided tour you don\u2019t know what you are looking at",
          "It is fun you think you are in a village and forgot you are in Barcelona. There is a lots of artisan shop and always have themes like for Halloween for example lots of fun",
          "Visited just as it opened. Only had 40 mins so it didn't help that the audio tour shop didn't open until half an hour after being let in! Spain! Great idea to have a 'model world' of Spain in one place. Great viewers from outside.",
          "This place is so chilled and so pretty. Lots of handcrafted things.",
          "Poble Espanyol is located in one of the most beautiful parts of Barcelona. Buildings and the atmosphere on the streets are quite authentic with super nice shops and restaurants. The exhibition spaces offer variety of content. Definitely a place to visit and come back...",
          "It's a nice place to walk through, I wouldn't go especially for it but if in the area it's nice",
          "Very good experience being there\nAlot of local shops which gives you an idea about Spain more",
          "If you go here and have a rental car park in a parking garage. We parked on the street and car window was smashed to get head phones that my daughter left in the back seat. We had to go file a police report and then switch or rental car. The actual place is very beautiful and full of history.",
          "Better to go towards evening time then u get good photo shots",
          "I would look to get souvenirs in this spot\n We found items at half the price of what they were charging in the shops on the La Rambla. The location also gives a good overview of the various regions of a Spain and their architecture. Walk down to the fountains of Monjuic. A.great little trip",
          "Beautiful place great architecture, clean and well maintained",
          "This is a little gem of a place, similar to Port Merion but on a grander scale. The narrow pathways are lovely to meander round and the many different building styles maintain interest. There are lovely views of the city near to the church. \u2026",
          "A bit of everything to showcase Spain. Shops for various craft (high-end and affordable). Food, rest rooms etc. on site. Designed for tourists and on the hop-on-hop-off route.",
          "Great place to see the different era of Spanish architecture..",
          "It's a heritage place with excellent sculptures",
          "Not that big. If you expect to spend there few hours, then no. But interesting architecture and also a lot of cafes and shops",
          "Very nice, but, plastic grass....really?!",
          "Not too advertised but real nice. A lot of examples of Spanish architecture plus stores full of artisanal products. We went during an Argentinian festival on the open stage on the main square, it was very lively and entertaining. Overall a good destination.",
          "A nice and long walk with major Spanish historical sights and events !",
          "Interesting only if you have never visited other parts of Spain. Only one workshop was available (for 3 EUR).",
          "Very disappointed. Paid entry fee of \u20ac14 to find that nearly everything was closed inside. Only a few shops and restaurants were open. Should either close it from November or at least reduce the entry free. With not much open to see, we walked around and left in under an hour.",
          "Interesting place to visit, can get tickets outside the castle and when you enter the gate a small village is revealed, little shops and cafes inside, but you can also go up to the gardens and enjoy the views and have a picnic if the weather is good.",
          "Iittle known gem. Best enjoyed with locals at night when there is a band playing.",
          "The small Spanish village the minimize Spain in this village and has many shops hand made things with restaurants and cafes it's worth ti visit as my memory its cost 14 euro for ticket for one person",
          "Plenty to look at here well worth a visit",
          "Great place. Unbelivable",
          "Very nice reconstruction of the typical spanish buildings. Highly recommended",
          "Take three stops on the subway and go to the Gothic quarter instead.\n\nThis place is kind of like a replica of the city that currently exists and has real history, so the placement is a little strange. This theme park would make sense in an \u2026",
          "A picturesque place where you can get an idea of the traditional architecture of Spain and where several events are organized.",
          "Visit it if you wish to know how small villages in Spain look like. I'm Spanish and I find Poble Espanyol very realistic!",
          "I would prefer not having an entrance fee at all, or a much smaller price",
          "Great experience to visit poble espanyol , the old town all about spain , shopping, coffees, everything about Spain",
          "Good place if you want visit all Spain during one day",
          "Save your money by going after 8 when the shops close. The shops sell some interesting items but very over priced, they are not very welcoming and you are forbidden from taking photos in the shops; weird. \nThe art gallery is nicely \u2026",
          "Nothing special, doesn't have the vibe as it's artificially made. You can buy local and handmade products there, there are restaurants and tapas bars.",
          "A very interesting tour to know about the characteristics of each Spain's region with realistic replica of the main building of the cities in original size. Also, there is a beautiful view from Barcelona since the balconies. The museum with \u2026",
          "Just OK ..... Not much real history .... Food was plentiful but just ok ... Shops were nice ...  Not going again",
          "Get the audio guide, it takes less than an hour to walk around the guided route and there's loads of information on Spanish history and architechture.  After that you can walk around and take in the craft shops and wide selection of tapas \u2026",
          "Despite the cost to get in, its a lovely place to wander, have a meal and see some shops with local goods.",
          "A beautiful microcosm of Spain. Within a couple of hours you feel like you have travelled across the whole Iberian peninsula, from Cadiz to Santiago de Compostela. There are multiple cafes dotted around so you can sit and take in the \u2026",
          "Not recommend. How to spend 15 euro for visit several souvenir shops.",
          "Very picturesque place, perfect buildings, very cool shops, nice gardens and corridors. You feel that you are in a fairytale. I didn't like the price of the ticket at all. 14 euros per person? I hope some day in Greece we start to charge the entries in our mountain villages like Metsovo. It was pretty much the same thing. Hahahahaha.",
          "Kinda cool, though if you are in Barcelona for a short visit, I suggest spending your time and money somewhere else",
          "Really nice well land buildings from all over Spain.. we enjoyed are time there.",
          "Excellent plase to see different cultures In different areas of the spain",
          "A nice way to look around Spain in an hour or so. We enjoyed our visit and had some nice tapas there too. My only concern is that not all parts are accessible and thus we really struggled with the pram. I don't know how and if someone with \u2026",
          "This place is wonderful! Not over exaggerating, but we spent there almost 5 hours and loved every minute of it. It's open all year round as far as I understood, and honestly, the best time to visit is whenever there's as little people as \u2026",
          "The old reconstructed village should have free access. The visit is not worth the entrance fee.",
          "A good place to have an idea of real traditional Spain. Very nice shops in there",
          "Just beautiful with a lot of stores inside, a great place in BCN that I don't see people talking about",
          "Brilliant idea to reunite replicas of famous Spanish monuments from other regions of Spain all in one little village. And the ambiance is great, lots of little restaurants and bars and boutiques. I recommend it.",
          "A magic theme village, a must do in your checklist if you go to Barcelona. You'll find lots of artisan ateliers and places to eat, but the best is having the feeling of the old villages just inside Barcelona.",
          "Abit overpriced if you forget your discount leaflet but a nice little village filled with history",
          "Calm and quiet. Villages with history. Nicely maintained.+ Point Metro connection.",
          "Little village that has mini neighborhoods that match the regions of Spain. Lots of shops and restaurants.",
          "Not worthy for the money. Purely touristic.",
          "Such a cool place to view some architecture.",
          "Nice place to go to get to know some more about spanish history. Go to the Fiesta and watch the movie. It is very well done.",
          "To get a first hand feel of an authentic Spanish village of the early 1900s, head to the Poble Espanyol in Barcelona. Don't miss the leather workshop there.",
          "If you want to experience other parts of Spain and you don't have time to go to them, watch videos and read pages on the web. I found this to be an unengaging and lacking part of Barcelona. The audio guide was lacking in information, as was \u2026",
          "It's like paying 14 euros just to access a singular shopping that looks like an old spanish town. The place is very beautiful but there's nothing you can do except watching a boring 8 minute video that they promote as a \"multimedia \u2026",
          "Sonar pre-party was so disappointing. A great line up but a poor spirit. Hedonism at its worse. Great music, non friendly crowed, expensive drinks, non helpful behavior, non friendly underpaid staff... and cherry on top: unconscious attendees getting poor help when falling on exit stairs. I will never come back.",
          "I was not impressed, you better run through the gothic quarter. You can see that its not that important anymore due to lack of maintenance. We payed entrance but due to  a festival you don't have a back in time feeling. The outside \u2026",
          "I paid full ticket whereas only half of it was opened due to a Concert/Rave party.  Shops closed early in the evening. No interest or maybe if you have kids... although not so well maintained.",
          "Super cute little old town in the Montjuic part of Barcelona. Loads of little alleyways and cute shops to see there! Can very much recommend if your in the area!",
          "Very beautiful, we paid 7\u20ac because the shops were shut, but was worth it.",
          "So cool and fun,I loved the place and the fiesta.if you like to know more about Spain,then don\u2019t miss this chance .",
          "Went for Afterlife during OFFsonar. Amazing place for a party.!! \ud83d\ude0d",
          "All about Spain in a small \"village\" inside Barcelona. Great experience if you have few days here.",
          "I have recently visit Poble Espanyol and it was a very disappointed visit  and had the feeling 'wasting time and money' \nMany years ago i already visited once and it was very interesting but now it's too much shop, bars and restaurants.  No \u2026",
          "Beautiful place , visiting in January is a challenge as weather was bound to be bad . However I highly recommend.",
          "Love this place. It's my favourite place in Barcelona. More people should know this exists. Totally recommend!!",
          "This one of the most magic places in Barcelona. Check out the agenda for gigs or music festivals, 'cause if you're lucky you'll live one of the greatest venues in Barcelona!",
          "This place is really beautiful on it is own way and It is nice to see the different stile of houses around the Spane on one place,  especially if you like architecture. There is also a really good panoramic view to the city.",
          "Beautiful space and lovely idea, in a beautiful part of the city.",
          "Must visit, if you like also flamenco can be visited and after go to the lightining fontain .",
          "Was fun for us to have seen it, and see the different styles of houses, but we won't go there a second time. It's just not our thing - too commercial.",
          "Pretty cool but we could not find any house with interior design as original houses",
          "The Spanish Village is a marvel of reconstruction of historic budings into one place. It feels medieval and unique, with tight small streets and buildings from all regions of Spain. You can find restaurants to take a brake and eat \u2026",
          "Liked it was separated into north, south, east ans west. Tapas experience in restaurant was not very authentic- nachos with cheese, chicken nuggets and chips! You coyld only spend a couple of hours here. Staff were very friendly.",
          "Old city with too many cultural history. Love that.",
          "The area is brilliant for studying Spanish architecture and art, as well as being a fantastic place for souvenirs. The site is situated in a lovely area and has some phenomenal views and photo opportunities",
          "In your wanderings around the city. Stop by this little village on the Montjuic hill side.  Quaint little shops on even quainter streets.  Flowers planted in flower pots hanging on the walls of the buildings. Find out if any special thing \u2026",
          "I came here with Brunch in the City. Really loved the location. There were normal toilets as well. Liked this location more than Brunch in the Park! Would love to visit it soon during the day time as well!",
          "At first glance the facade made me think this would be a hokey theme park experience, but that is far from the truth. Built about 100 years ago this Spanish village represents Ann the regions of Spain through architectural blocks. There are \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a nice place to spend half day knowing all types of Spanish culture and architecture. Especially recommend the video show called FIESTA, it takes about 10 minutes to introduce the most famous celebration in Spain.",
          "Just walked by without stopping in. Looks interesting but 15 euro per adult charge was too steep with our itinerary being time limited.",
          "Nice place to go for an event and the best way to not even pay to see it. I recently went there for the beer festival and it was super nice, they have a big central place with cover, though you always have places to take in the sun.",
          "Attended ofsonar music festival and venue was just perfect for the same. Very unique.",
          "They classify this as a museum but it is not exactly a museum but a mini Spain. Built around the same time as the magic fountain, this \"village\" was built to showcase the rich architectural heritage of the different spanish regions. So you \u2026",
          "One of my favorite places in Barcelona. Love this atmosphere.",
          "I'm living with Google map in mountain",
          "Not worth the price in my opinion. Its a recreated old town full of shops and restaurants. Nothing special in my opinion.The main area was closed due to an event and the staff was a bit pushy and rude when we went into an area that was apparently closed.",
          "Great for people who are short on time but want to experience a little bit of every part of Spain.",
          "Great experience to see different styles from all the Spain regions in one place.",
          "This would be a fun place for someone who visits Spain for the first time and wants to get a general feel of different regions of the vast country. Houses and food representing fifty regions are meshed in this large park. However, I should \u2026",
          "Really worth a visit. Local crafts from clothing, trinkets and jewellery. Watch the craftsman as they produce some stunning products.",
          "The buildings are very impressively built and it's easy to mistake many of them as genuine from a distance. The overall area is basically a form of theme park whereby each section represents a different part of Spain and the blending \u2026",
          "Definitely touristy, but a neat place to explore. Wouldn't bother shopping or eating here as the shops are overpriced.",
          "Love this place, it's kind of like tapas for tourism. You get little bits of all parts of Spain.",
          "The place is pretty and charming, but you shouldn't have to pay to visit a bunch of shops and restaurants.",
          "It s nice to hang around , you can easily spend 2 houra. But very touristic. They made a village to reflect the architecture, culture of different areas of Spain (north, south..). Watch the fiesta 3d show, it's nice",
          "this place is amazing to go party ! i went to the drum code party for offsonar and it was amazing great sound it was open air the staff was great !\nLove the look of it , looks like your entering an old beautiful town",
          "It brings all the Spanish culture together, and you can see one of a kind buildings in one place. I recommend the audio guide. It is superb. The museum is free and has one of a kind Picasso pottery collection!",
          "We were here in early March, and most of the shops were closed. Sad. I expected the full experience, but really, it felt more deserted than busy/party/fiesta. I wish places like these had reduced prices for off-season visits, because you're \u2026",
          "The small town of Poble Espanyol recreates quite remarkably well the typical architecture styles of different regions of Spain. You can also enjoy the typical gastronomy of those regions without moving from Barcelona.",
          "The place was like miniature Spain. The best part of the tour was the 10 min multimedia show called SPAIN FIESTA. It got the colors, culture and vibrancy of Spain  live for 10 mins. The shopping is also nice with good stuff and not very \u2026",
          "Very nice, I recommend!",
          "This is a great place to see some examples of Spanish traditional/historical architecture. However be aware that off the summer peak season a lot of the small shops which showcase traditional crafts will be shut. Having said that, the visit \u2026",
          "Visited for a private party. Big venue and interesting architecture. Food provided was good. Bit touristy in terms of shops.",
          "Tiny village where you can see everything about Spanish architecture, crafting, dance etc in one place",
          "If you spend in Barcelona one week or more, you can go there and see something (nothing special). If your trip is short, don't waste your time and money - there are millions better things to do and see in this city.",
          "Really nice decorations for Christmas!",
          "Quite interesting way of knowing Spanish culture, even if could be better explored.",
          "Not something special. It is like a miniature of the buildings and houses of all Spain, but every building has a shop(restaurants, souvenirs) and this is a bit annoying.",
          "This is likely a fairy tale of Spain . they made great job , congrats especially all videos in every part of Spain .We had limited time therefore we visited the place in the evening but it would be better to stop by in daily hours .The \u2026",
          "Its a must in Barcelona. We had an amazing time here",
          "Really enjoy seeing the different.city's represented in one location! Awesome!!",
          "It was interesting.  The audio was challenging to use.  They didn't supply headsets so if you get one share it with your partner and save 3.50 euro.  It waa a tad over priced but of you go there before the sky cable car they give you a coupon to save 3 euro.",
          "Went on a Saturday afternoon and a bunch of businesses were closed. It\u2019s still a beautiful place, needs like 2 hours to be explored",
          "This was my favourite place in Barcelona. We went immediately upon opening and we were the only ones there. This led to us getting to take some really beautiful photos and we enjoyed the scenery before the hustle and bustle. After more \u2026",
          "Not worth the entrance price. It was 14 Euros for an adult, but there's only a couple videos to watch inside (videos mostly of festivals and food) and mostly shopping from there. The buildings were kind of cool, but you can see cool buildings walking around Barcelona for free.",
          "Great concert with the Offspring. But the actual place is artificial.",
          "In my opinion maybe the most magnificent part of Barcelona. You can feel the spirit of Catalonia and Spain itself like nowhere else. You can learn a lot of the history of each part of Spain by many different and interesting ways. \u2026",
          "My comment is about the having the space at the back for social activities, I find it spacious, well managed, and perfectly located. I attended an event of ~1000 attendees and we had great time is such a nice place",
          "An amazing village with some exquisite examples of Spanish architecture, and so many shops and restaurants. A great day had by all the family.",
          "Love this place. Second time I've been. It has a homey feel to it. Great way they've set it up. Cafes, restaurants, shops, handicrafts, food, sculpture garden and some art. Something for everyone.",
          "Beautiful little medieval town with plenty of places to go out or to dance. 4* and not 5* because they always try to trick you andD pay more (in these places I mean)",
          "Interesting to see the different spanish variations in culture/building. But not quite Worth the entry fee. Good view of town from the monastery",
          "Not worth the time or money! Beware of this tourist trap.",
          "Was here for a festival, Punk in drublic. Cool venue. So the pictures doesn't describe the area so good.",
          "Poble Espanyol (El Pueblo Espa\u00f1ol) is an ideal place to visit, especially if you have little or no time to visit the entire Iberian Peninsula (Spain). A tourist attraction for all ages!",
          "Okay, more like a private souvenir shopping strip.",
          "Wow is all I have to say. Go visit it...",
          "Very good place to visit.\nYou can see a flamenco dance here!!",
          "Nice. Good for children. Many things from all Spain.",
          "Was at the Biergarten here last week. What a great time. This venue is great, so much to see and the museum beautiful.",
          "In a relatively short walk you can see a reproduction of tipical buildings from Spain regions. Lot of restaurants and artisanal shops.",
          "Pretty average, I didn't appreciate any of those media presentations. Also main square was under construction and viewpoint near the church was closed due to some private event.",
          "In this village they have gathered and constructed houses with all the architecture from whole Spain. There are some shops and restaurants in the area.",
          "The space represents the architectural home style of each geographical part of the Spain. It is very good organised effort to be showed   the facilities of the people houses in any region of Spain and people's traditions. It isa beautiful walk among all those marvelous buildings.",
          "Felt very touristy and fake, while some might love it this was not my cup of tea.",
          "Ok, not a big deal",
          "Nicely exposed the diversity of beautiful Spain. Recommend it!",
          "most romantic place. amazing view of the city. great flamenco show.",
          "lot of concerts in Here ..",
          "Better than I thought it would be. Quite diverse and a nice place to spend the day.",
          "Always great to viem a mixture of spanish culture in one convenient place!",
          "You can visit  Spain without moving out from Barcelona...don't miss this outdoor museum! The BEST: to get lost along the small streets of \"Andalucia\"",
          "Poble Espanyol is one of the unique places in Barcelona where you can find entertainment for everyone. Art, architecture, gastronomy brings life to this hidden jewel in Barcelona.",
          "The experience from Poble Espanyol, in general, wasn't the expected. There were a lot of constructions inside and if you wanted to buy a ticket you wouldn't get the best customer service from the staff. Hope this will change soon because the place worths it.",
          "Really well presented typical spanish town - somewhat commercialized. Took in the flamenco show with tapas - absolutely first class",
          "We had a nice afternoon. Architecture is authentic. Regard you have to invest time for it. Disadvantage: prices and food quality are typical for touristic places.",
          "A hidden gem. Piece of old Spain. Worth a visit.",
          "My husband and I paid 14 euros each to walk around shops and restaurants that you can see anywhere in Barcelona. Half of them were not open. It could have be because it was the off season, but there was nothing special about this place. The description on the tourist bus did not depict as the theme park it actually is.",
          "Nice stone buildings! Was there for Brunch in the Park! I liked it!",
          "Nice place must visit .",
          "Good place to visit but you could spend at least two hours enjoying this tour at your ease.not run in and out",
          "Cool place, historic interest. Go early to avoid crowds (although the shops do not open until maybe a couple hours after the park opens - you can use this time to see everything more privately and get nice photos). Also has a nice view of Barcelona. It's a short 10 minute walk to the subway. Well worth a visit!",
          "A delightful place to visit with your beloved one. Enjoy a walk on the narrow streets and admire the old buildings picked as jewels, from all Spain.",
          "Beautiful \"fake\" Spanish Town with lots of very nice high-end shopping.  Don't go on a Monday because everything is closed.",
          "Nice place, great food. Wasn't aware that it was built in the 30s of last century to conserve different architectural styles.",
          "As an attraction in itself I wouldn't recommend it, it's very dated. It's better for the events that they put on whether music or food ones. As a traffic free place to eat or drink it certainly has its merits. It's like a village within the \u2026",
          "I wish I would have saved more time. Happy not to leave without being able to see here",
          "Good place with a good purpose which it is well achieved",
          "most part of shops were closed till 12 am \nprices are too high and it is mainly a place for children",
          "Such a great place! Really enjoyed the visit",
          "This place is like a minature Spain. cool. You should come here..",
          "It is a nice place if you like to discover about architecture of Spain but not the first place you must visit in Barcelona. If you have enough time you can visit there. There are many places where you can photograph, many restaurants, cafe's and art shops inside, you can spend more than 2 hours there.",
          "It's a very beautiful place to experience the every part of the spain in a short time. They also have museums especially spanish artists. Including very famous ones such as Dali. I would recommend you to go especially with your child. Because it's a very family friendly place.",
          "If you enjoy Epcot, with its fake buildings and cheesy shops, this place is for you. The structures are pretty well made but this is your basic turista experience. Horrible music (the Eagles?!? Led Zepplin!!?) booming from the square echoes \u2026",
          "We loved it ! So gorgeous and great views . We did Spain experience where we were brought in to a huge room with massive screen , doors were closed , we laid on bean bags and enjoyed an 8 min show. It was fab! The little food places were \u2026",
          "Amazing place with very beautiful Spanish architecture. Recommend to visit it.",
          "It's ok. I wouldn't be upset if I couldn't fit it in the itinerary. Very nice and crafty items. Beautiful jewelry pieces, scarfs, fans, and many other things",
          "Very nice artisans",
          "Interesting place where you can see buildings, typical for the different areas of Spain. It is a bit smaller than I expected and you can only see the buildings from the outside. There are some nice shops for local artists.",
          "Very touristy, gift shops, places to eat. Building architecture is interesting even if only replications. A bit of a distraction from the rest of Barcelona.",
          "There's NOTHING to see inside. Don't even think about visiting it. We visited on Nov 2018 and there was less than half of the stores open, almost no visitors. Nothing inteesting inside. The place has a good potential but is totally down.",
          "In my Opinion the place is good but is overpriced. For the price of the tickets we didn't see something that worthed.",
          "Some people will dismiss the Pueblo Espanol as commercial and kitsch. Something like Spain's own Disneyland. I am not one of those people. \nIt's not my intention to understate the business aspect of the place. Yes, they are restaurants and \u2026",
          "Was good but make sure to go during a busy time. Otherwise feels deserted.",
          "Great nite",
          "Did not go to the museum but saw MGMT there and the show was amazing. The space was beautiful, just the right size for the group, not too crowded. Food, beer, and water available for purchase.",
          "Do not buy the audioguide. It's not very engaging. The buildings are okay but nothing amazing. The most interesting parts are the stores.",
          "Went for a concert there and really surprised me the layout and setup. There are a few bars inside you can drink or eat something",
          "A viilage with hand made items. There are stores-mini where there u can buy stuff.\nThere is a man who makes all kind of stuff from scrapyard pieces-metals",
          "Definetely very interesting place\ud83d\ude0a",
          "This place makes it in top 10 creepiest places I have ever been to as we went after 9pm in a cold and rainy november evening, when there was not a single person inside the museum, not one noise, but our steps. Proper scary movie. I must say \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed visiting - can experience all provinces of Spain in one place - highly recommended",
          "Great idea to put all Spanish architecture styles in one place. A bit artificial",
          "A memorable time in the sightseeing of the picturesque street walks, buildings, people  and horizon in the distance.  Pictures tell a thousand words.  Enjoyed every moment.  And blessed with good weather plus plenty of sunshine.  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "The place was a traditional poble, lots of great and old buildings. A small Spain , if you might call ut they",
          "Such a nice place! Recommended!",
          "We had a great time strolling around after the shops had closed. A beautiful place. We had an EXTRAORDINARY time watching the flamenco at Tablao de Carmen!",
          "This open air architectural museum is very well maintained, the museum has 117 full scale buildings which recreate Spanish villages.charming small cafes line the streets. Explore this place at leisure.",
          "Disappointed in this attraction.  They charged us 14 euros per person to enter on a Friday night and most of the stores were closed.  There was nothing going on inside and the restaurants serve low quality frozen and boxed food.  Not worth \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit! Experience all the different parts of Spain in one place",
          "Nice museum. A bit Dysneyland but nice and you see a lot on one place.",
          "Interesting examples of Spanish architecture and regions, not everything was open when we were there",
          "A very beautiful place one has to visit to witness the view of the city from here",
          "Beautiful place in Monjuit a high mountain in Barcelona",
          "I've visited this place twice over the course of a few years, but to be honest I think it is not worth it especially for how expensive the entrance fee is. The aim of the place is to offer the visitors a brief experience of different parts \u2026",
          "Great place to visit with family",
          "The soul of spain, you can see all the different architecture of spain in one place",
          "Good place for walk in middle of day then temperature is high",
          "If you have extra time in the city then it worths visiting",
          "I really liked the rooms scattered around the map with short clips of the regions of Spain.",
          "Poble Espanyol is a cool take on a museum. It features architecture from all over the country into a small patch of land on Montj\u00fcic. It's a great place to learn more about the culture and history of the different regions of Spain. I really \u2026",
          "Interesting to see but way too expensive for what it is. The food at the restaurant inside wasn't very good. It is quaint though.",
          "Very neat attraction. Museums, shops, local craftsman showing off their creations, restaurants all wrapped up in recreations of different Spanish building styles through the ages. Well worth the price of admission. Close enough to a number of other attractions to make it worthwhile to take a cab out of the downtown area.",
          "This open space museum has been built almost 90 years ago... And is still in a good shape!!...Very well maintained and very educational and in the same time fun. If you're planning to visit you will need 2-3 hours. Enjoy \"little\" Spain!! \u2026",
          "Great place. Quiet out of season but good for a couple of hours. Some original Picasso work too.",
          "We went at night when tickets were cheaper which is what I would recommend. Outside of the architecture and the view of the city, its basically a shopping mall from the looks of the many closed stores when we were there.",
          "Not worth the 14\u20ac for entry. Inside is mostly cafes and artisan shops selling souvenir trinkets. I thought it would be more like a heritage village with richer historical information available and maybe period piece actors. Maybe during off \u2026",
          "Great place for some local Spanish shopping is good quality without the exorbitant price tags. Lovely people in the shops, happy to show explain their work and creations. Food was a bit of a disappointment. The re creation of architecture is mildly impressive.",
          "What a disappointment! It's only worth for the village's architecture, but you can see that in half an hour. Waste of money. Bad shops, worst museums, really bad restaurants and you can eat so well in Spain, how is it possible that they have such bad restaurants? Will never ever return to this place.",
          "Not much to do there except look around at the different types of architecture. It was nice enough to visit if it's on the way.",
          "An amazing place to travel, and eat.  The atmosphere is unforgettable.",
          "Really interesting to see. Lots of shops, crafts and restaurants as well as information about different areas of Spain. Some very beautiful buildings too. Tickets aren't expensive and a visit is well worth the money.",
          "Good place to visit if you're doing a 1-2 days trip to Barcelona and you haven't been at Spain before, otherwise better skip it. Be aware the entrance fee is about 14 Euros and the place is usually crowded.",
          "Beautiful side of Barcelona Spanish village experience",
          "If you want to experience the whole of Spain in a small village this is the place to be.",
          "A wonderful place to visit, lots of old world shops, lots to see and do,well worth a visit if near Barcelona,",
          "Not that interesting.\nVery expensive for something like that",
          "Historical collection of Spain's architecture and handcraft. Village has different houses, courtyard, museum, cafeterias, restaurants, gift shops. Building styles from all over the country and showing regional cultures. The modern art \u2026",
          "Interesting place to visit, but it is better to visit it when there is some event going on. The museum isn't good, but the architecture is nice.",
          "Interesting place. There are a lot of  Spanish houses from different regions of Spain. Unfortunately there is no possibility to visit the inside of these. I don't understand why to pay a ticket as almost every house ground floor has a store, restaurant, shops, bars.",
          "Interesting place, gives you an idea of traditional architecture and handmade crafts of the region. Tapas, restaurants and music as well. \nI personally liked it;)",
          "It has special store :ORFEBER-ESCULTER ,Roberto Fuentes see here !",
          "Cool museum with interesting artifacts",
          "It's a great place to learn more about Spain, its culture, architecture and traditions. You need to spend almost the whole day walking there)",
          "Not bad, but with so many other things to do and see in Barcelona, wouldn't make it a priority.",
          "Poble Espanyol, a village that brings together in the form of a real country, the typical places of Spain and the different representations of the art of its regions. In Poble there are 117 buildings, streets and squares within a harmonious \u2026",
          "Poble Espanyol is a must to see if you are traveling to Barcelona. It will open you to Spanish culture and history of different  regions in Spain. definitely worth",
          "Good place to spent the afternoon with kids",
          "Great place. Very nice feel to it like being in historical small city. Relatively close to Fira Gran Via if you stay close by for a conference.",
          "Beautiful and interesting open air museum. On each street you find different spanish arquitecture.",
          "The place had a vibe of positively to it.",
          "Very fun place to see the different styles and influences of Spanish architecture. It almost takes you through time. They also have little exhibits and you can check out glass blowers and people making leather goods. Would recommend.",
          "Diversity of architecture,  lots of parrots and artisanal outlets.",
          "Good restaurants, beautiful buildings and view to the city. Recommend!",

          "It was disappointing. We felt like we paid to get inside a small shopping center that was Spanish themed. Most of the buildings are shops or restaurants and it didn't feel like it was worth the money. Beautiful and but not what was \u2026",
          "Lovely insight to the culture of Spain.  The artisan shops were really good and gave you an opportunity to  see how traditional skills and crafts are kept alive.",
          "Just amazing! No words to describe! Everyone needs to go!",
          "very nice place",
          "Beautiful place, very good to see in your visit to Montjuic. It is a small Spanish town which mixes the most important regions in Spain, it has stores of the different places with traditional things and food, it has a nice view of the city \u2026",
          "I don\u2019t recommend going there at all. This was a waste of time and money. Plus they were doing a lot of renovations when I went in April 2019 so we couldn\u2019t see a lot of the different architecture.",
          "Beautiful architecture of Barcelona.",
          "Nice place to visit. You can see buildings from all Spain. All the shops are selling hand made objects and some of them are made in the shop and you can see the process. In the night the place have a special charm. You have a beautiful \u2026",

          "Very well done! This gives you a perfect idea of what you have to go see while in Spain. It is fantastic to walk around all the regions of Spain and the atmosphere is well re-created, but it is of course way better to jump on the train and go visit Andalusia, Galicia and the other regions.",
          "Best place to brunch!",
          "This place is worthy of attention.",
          "It's a nice place and easy to reach to by train or bus. However \u20ac14 are too much for the entry fees, and it's more than what is mentioned on the website \u20ac6.3 as it is \u20ac7 for kids and \u20ac14 for adults. In brief it's an ok place but  for such \u2026",
          "Wasn\u2019t quite interested to pay to get in there at the beginning, yet once in there, it\u2019s worth it.  Neat way to experience all NWSE of Spain in a nutshell.  Picasso and the contemporary art collection.  Local artisans stores in appreciating \u2026",
          "Beautiful display of Spanish culture. We didn't visit the museum but had lovely experience of flamenco dance and dinner at Tablao de Carmen.",
          "Definitely worth a visit - especially if you would like to get a \"taste\" of the different regions of Spain, which are all represented here. This village is a remnant of the Spanish worlds fair that features architecture, artisans, and \u2026",
          "I loved the concept, and enjoyed the architecture development. However, morning has very few attractions except for stores and restaurant. If this place focus of the different regions of spain, it should have people dress from said region \u2026",
          "Great some town where one can see the best regions of Spain but in a miniature version. I highly recommend to go especially to view the different building and architectural styles of each section of Spain. \n\nThey also sell hand made goods such as glass, leather goods.",
          "Wonderful if you go early when it's empty to walk around and admire the beautiful buildings. Closest thing you can get to going back in time. Also full of interesting shops and many restaurants. A must see when in Barcelona.",
          "It's a great place to spend a nice few hours soaking up typical Spanish architecture and leaning a bit about the different regions. Small shops and restaurants make it worth your while too.",
          "Great place to visit with children.",
          "It's interesting to visit this place is you're in Spain only for few days, you'll get a good sense of all Spain in one walk. It will take you one to two hours to visit this place which is on top of one of the hills. There are many restaurants as well.overall it felt a bit kitschy because it's all made up in a new structure",
          "Vert expensive.\nIt was a glorified shopping complex that charged you a lot of money to enter.\nInside were expensive restaurants.\nVery little educational content.\n\nThe tourism video of Spain was good, only a few minutes long.\nMuseum was OK.",
          "It's good destination if you have a family. If not, it's boring.",

          "It's a very commercialized very small version of the EPCOT center all about Spain.  Definitely not worth 14 euros and even less worth the 2.5 euros for the audio guide.  It's a tourist trap.",
          "You need to pay to enter, and pay to use anything once inside. It's beautiful, but fake. Specially disappointed by the Christmas event. Any mall does a better job for free",
          "Interesting place to visit. Close by many others places that Worth to visit",
          "4 stars if it were free. Catalonian's pay nothing. Tourists pay a fee UNLESS you have a reservation at a restaurant inside the venue.",
          "A nice place. A copy of a traditional Spanish village build to show tourists how people used to live. I guess.\n\nMainly restaurants and shops. Not much to do. I didn't really understand why the attraction is so popular.",
          "Really beautiful but overpriced it is too small to pay 16\u20ac for the entrance",
          "Too expensive for what it offers. Better see it on real somewhere in the country. Most of souvenirs aren't local but most likely Chinese.",

          "One of the best places to visit in Barcelona. Lots of information about the cities, traditions, architecture and fiestas in Spain. The movie about the fiestas in Spain is a must! You could watch how beautiful figures of glass are made by a skilful master. Authentic atmosphere, unique place.",
          "Nice place and if you have discounted prices tickets it's really a good way to see Spanish architecture in one place. You can have nice meals in different restaurants and there's a REAL PASTRY SHOP with cakes and bonbons not like in other places where the maximum is croissant or churros... A real sweet orgy for the eyes and taste...",
          "It's a bit too touristy for my taste, but you can not fault the great restaurants inside the \"Spanish Town\". The best way to enjoy it, in my opinion, is to go on a weekday on the low season, when most tourists will be elsewhere. Then, you \u2026",

          "Great way to see a variety of architectural styles. Didn't do the AV tour but just enjoyed wandering around the streets and shipping in the various arts and crafts stores, getting a drink and just being there. Discount entry vouchers are \u2026",
          "Good for families during the day .. at night it\u2019s a place for young adults \ud83d\ude01",
          "This review is for New Years Eve at Poble Espanyol! So much fun and so organiser despite the huge crowds. They have separate sections for pop Music and Techno, which I discovered quite late into the night. Each section had around 1000 \u2026",
          "I had a lovely experience. It is located in a mountain and well connected by public transport. The architecture inside is worth the 14eu. Student discount available. Very unique place. There are many shops and cafes inside in each lane.",
          "Awesome representation of Spain in a little made up town. Really enjoyable.",
          "Amazing and must go to place to know about Spain's history",

          "Not very inspiring. expensive to get in and expensive beer too",
          "Fun to walk, but the kids need to be bigger than mine. Oldest was 7 and he still did not have the patience to pay attention and understand the difference between the architectural styles. If your don't have the time to visit other parts of Spain, then it's worth to come here.",
          "Couldn't get over the architecture and quality.",
          "I definitely recommend a visit, the tickets are not too expensive and you can '' travel'' in to different places of Spain. But keep in mind that you have to wear comfortable shoes and bring some water with you, also the craft shops in the area are too overpriced, that's why I give 4 stars instead of 5",
          "Great place to go in Barcelona, great views for taking pictures, there are many restaurants and sweet shops with fair prices too, highly recommended.",
          "Cute place as a must visit if you are in Barcelona.  Hop on Hop off will take you there.  Plan to see the Carmen Flamengo show. If you buy the ticket for the show then entry after 4pm is waived.",

          "Nice view showing various parts of Spain attempting to contrast them. Includes architectural, cultural aspects.",
          "It is nice but explore the city is much better. The shops are authentic and you can buy nice handmade things, but the entrance fee is too expensive for buying things inside, not really worth for money. The food inside the village is forgottable.",
          "A bit of a mixed experience. I liked the architecture which composed the attraction because it was easy to move from one style to another. Furthermore, the place has a lot of charm. However, there wasn't much more than that besides the huge \u2026",
          "Really nice and interesting place, basically living museum in the nature where u can see life in different parts of Spain. However, the potential of the place is not used 100%. Also pricy and touristic. This museum definitely deserves a grow and improvement, still worth it to visit, thow.",
          "Spectacular!",
          "Charming village in the city. Great family time.",
          "A wonderful place to spend the day with and without kids. Representing the various regions of Spain through Arts, Culture and Gastronomy. We had a great time.",
          "It's not recommended out of season (February), the atmosphere is not very noticeable and the price is high. They are also doing construction on some of the village but the price is the same which is unfortunate",
          "Cost 15 euros to go in. There was an Mexican fiesta going on in the square. With street food, and Mexican clothes to buy. Enjoyed it allot. Great singing, dancing. Great atmosphere, but wouldn't have bothered going in otherwise.",

          "Good for turist",
          "Amazing buildings and perfect location for events, had the best new year's evening there.",

          "Nice place to visit.  Keep in mind that even if it closes late, the shops and museums in it closes near 8. We had a suprise when we get there because there were a private event in one section was not available for visiting.",
          "Historical arena, Great party venue, I had an amazing party party experience here.",
          "Nice place but apparently in January - February most of the stores are closed.\nAlso not recommended for families with toodlers.",
          "Local tradition is preserved nicely .Please do visit",
          "Its a just place with stores. You cant feel the spanish spirit. Its not worth",

          "If not the best, one of the best place to visit in Barcelona. Great area for a concert. Also the night club there is awesome. Culturally speaking it seems that it's a small medieval village and totally worth paying a visit.",

          "Fantastic place. Just watching a troupe of young American performers doing a terrific job, in 30 degrees of heat.\nWell worth the \u20ac14 entry pp. But discount available if you're on one of the hop on, hop off buses.",
          "We paid \u20ac45 to go round shops and pay to eat low quality food in a restaurant. Avoid, avoid, avoid. The worst value in Barcelona. This fake concrete collection of shops and buildings was dull. So disappointing.",
          "Not really a museum. Lovely reproduction of an old Catalan village, but with modern shops and restaurants. It has a very nice contemporary art museum and a sculpture garden, with good pieces (Dali, Picasso). It is very large with beautiful views of Barcelona.",
          "Good place to learn about Spain. Very clean and nice looking. I recommend the Contemporary Art Museum. You can find some nice Picasso works and other paintings of spanish modernists wich are impressing:)",
          "Pleasantly surprised by my visit :) very well set up with lots of variety of shops and the architecture does a great job of representing Spain :)",
          "Awesome place. Neat and tidy. Able to see lot of vibrancy and energy around the place",
          "Beautiful place to walk and see the different styles and cultures of Spain in one place. It's a tourists place, so it's not cheap to shop and dine.

          "The nightvisits are very bad, it has not enought lights and at night all restorants are converted into real nightclubs-it is very inappropriate and ugly. You come to see spanish vilages and architecture and you see drunk young people and \u2026",
          "Beautiful, full of history. I love the little shops in there. I wouldn't mind coming back again in the future",
          "Great activities for Halloween",
          "This is definitely a 'touristy' venue. It's a replica of Spanish architecture from around the country. We were there at the height of tourist season and it wasn't very busy. There are a number of shops with local artisanal work, which are \u2026",
          "Nothing much... A shopping area.. that's all",
          "The Poble Espanyol (literally, Spanish town) is an open-air architectural museum in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, approximately 400 metres away from the Fountains of Montju\u00efc. Built for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the museum \u2026",

          "Good place to be if you are a fan of architecture and want to learn about architectural styles in different regions of Spain. Apart from small buildings to showcase the architecture, there are shops to buy souvenirs, have coffee, eat and \u2026",
          "This place is like a mini Epcot for just Spain. It's awesome. You get to see many home styles from many places in Spain and see artisans work their crafts. Very nice experience.",
          "Good chance to explore the architecture of Spain in different regions at one place.During summers it's better to visit after 8:00 pm.There is decrease in ticket price after 8:00 pm.Take audio and video tour at  information office after the \u2026",

          "We had the unfortunate idea to eat at a caf\u00e9 in this park called \u2018La Granja\u2019..... the food was unspeakably bad and two of my family members were sick after the meal.  I ordered a \u2018risotto\u2019 that consisted of poorly cooked rice and low grade \u2026",

          "It's so great I love it",
          "Its all about the quality of the people that coming, because the sound is horrible! I've been there few times already with great djs but the sound dont do good to them.\nWorst speakers and indoor acoustic design ever",
          "Beutiful place and friendly peeps!",
          "Nice place to spend the whole day. Walk in the park, enjoy the shows in central square, grab a bite and some beer.",
          "Not worth it! You pay a fee for Walking through Shops that would be normally on the streets either way! Nothing to see there, really. The 'spanish architecture' thing is fully overrated. Don't go there!",
          "Great are to go with kids!",
          "A must visit place for anyone visiting Barcelona or Spain for the first time.\nThe place depicts the varying architecture of spain and the different cultures.\nThe shops here are also good which is surprising as mostly thess sort of places \u2026",
          "If they didn't charge to go in, I'd give it 4 stars but the \u20ac14 admissions price to go into what is basically a fancy outdoor mall just didn't sit well. Plus all the food on the inside is kinda expensive.",
          "Great! Especially by night.",
          "I took the night visit expecting lights and magic, but all the shops are closed, even though some restaurants are open and you dont get to see many people (it was saturday night).

          "Such a nice place to visit, with interesting things to see. There is a small museum inside, restaurants and many small stores where you can buy souvenirs. No need to buy tickets online, it is not too busy (May, 2018)",
          "It's an alright open air museum i guess. Personally  the 14\u20ac entrance fee seems a bit much for what it is. Inside you'll find artisan shops,  cafes, various styles of typical Spanish villages from different regions, there's also an area for live music at night from what i've heard.",
          "Very fun way to learn more about all the Spain, just make sure to know when it's open, the time window is quite small.",

          "A real museum about the different place that u can visit in spain!

Peaceful and also typical it\u2019s a good stop from the crowded city centre.",
          "The place is awesome. A perfect way to learn about Barcelona in less than an hour",
          "Expensive place to visit which it should be for free.\nDoesn't deserve that price.",
          "a bit disappointing because it really is just a bunch of buildings from different regions of spain. there's a church at the end though whose garden is worth visiting for its absolute serenity. additionally, i would also recommend the fiesta exhibit because it was an impressive presentation of various spanish holidays.",

          "The place is full of shops which spoiled the excitement of learni g about all times. I didn't like that everywhere your turned you had shops and restaurants and so little of what exactly was going on in old days. The entrance is chargeable \u2026",

          "Went there with my mom who is very interested in history, and she was completely disappointed. They can make the place a lot better by for example furnishing a few rooms in traditional style, add a few craftsman shops, just make it a real open air museum like Skansen (Sweden) or Etara (Bulgaria).",
          "The shops and shop owners are amazing.  Well worth your time, very enjoyable!",
          "Very nice and cozy when is not crowded",

          "Just beautiful!!  It gives glimpses of all regions in Spain.Must visit in Barcelona!!",
          "Good idea, but the end result is a weird hotchpotch of uninspiring architecture and full on commercial operation to push the souvenirs on the tourists. If that's your thing, go ahead though.",
          "Nice reproduction, it would be more interesting if the houses could be visited inside as well.",
          "It is a good idea, and is so beauty, but It needs more events, and there are not cities like Salamanca."

        "wiki": "Camp Nou (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02cckam\u02c8n\u0254w], meaning new field, often referred to in English as the Nou Camp) has been the home stadium of FC Barcelona since its completion in 1957, and it is located in Carrer d'Ar\u00edstides Maillol.With a seating capacity of 99,354, it is the largest stadium in Spain and Europe, and the third largest football stadium in the world in capacity. It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup final games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga final games, twenty-one Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final games, five matches including the opening game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the football competition final at the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe construction of Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona's previous stadium, Camp de Les Corts, had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou was used. The June 1950 signing of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, regarded as one of Barcelona's greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.The architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo Garc\u00eda-Barb\u00f3n.\n\n\n=== Early years and the 1982 World Cup ===\nIn May 1972, Camp Nou hosted its first European Cup Winners' Cup final between Rangers and Dynamo Moscow. Rangers won the match with a score of 3\u20132. The 1970s marked a turning point for Barcelona with the signing of a new player, Johan Cruyff, in 1973. Electronic scoreboards were installed in the stadium two years later.\nThe stadium underwent an expansion in 1980, in anticipation of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which added boxes, VIP lounges, a new press area, new markers and the construction of the third tier, which was smaller in height than the original design by 6 metres (46.60 metres compared to the original design of 52.50 metres). The expansion of the stadium added 22,150 new seats, taking the total seating capacity to 71,731, and the standing capacity was expanded by 16,500 to 49,670, taking the total stadium capacity (seated and standing combined) to 121,401. FC Barcelona's record attendance was set on 5 March 1986 in the European Cup quarter-final against Juventus in front of 120,000 spectators, just 1,401 shy of the stadium's capacity.\nCamp Nou was one of several stadiums used throughout the 1982 World Cup, hosting the inauguration ceremony on 13 June. It also hosted more matches in that tournament than any of the 16 other stadiums used all over Spain, including the opening match, where the traditional opening ceremonies took place (including the releasing of a dove). In front of 95,000, Belgium upset the defending champions Argentina 1\u20130 in that opening match. It then hosted three round-robin matches between the Soviet Union, Poland, and Belgium, which Poland ended up winning and qualifying from to reach the semi-finals, where they played Italy at the Camp Nou, losing 2\u20130; Italy went on to win the final match, which was played at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe stadium's capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nApart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua Bucure\u0219ti was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4\u20130. Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993\u201394, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favour of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998\u201399 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou's capacity settled to its current level. The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final later that year where Manchester United played Bayern Munich. United won 2\u20131, coming back from 0\u20131 down in injury time.During 1998\u201399, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities.In 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium's name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.The facilities now include a memorabilia shop, mini-pitches for training matches, and a chapel for the players. The stadium also houses the second-most visited museum in Catalonia, FC Barcelona Museum, which receives more than 1.2 million visitors per year.On 1 October 2017, Barcelona's league match against Las Palmas was played in an empty Camp Nou due to political turmoil in the region.\n\n\n== Renovation and expansion ==\nThe club issued an international tender to remodel the stadium as a celebration of the stadium's fiftieth anniversary. The objective was to make the facility an integrated and highly visible urban environment. The club sought to increase the seating capacity by 13,500, with at least half of the total seating to be under cover. The intention was to make it the third-largest stadium in the world in terms of seating capacity, after the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in North Korea (114,000 capacity) and the Motera cricket stadium in India (110,000 capacity).\nOn 18 September 2007, the British architect Norman Foster and his company were selected to \"restructure\" Camp Nou. The plan included the addition of roughly 6,000 seats, for a maximum capacity of 105,000, at an estimated cost of \u20ac250 million. The FC Barcelona board approved the sale of their former training ground (the Mini Estadi) against significant opposition in order to finance the remodeling. The project was planned to begin in 2009 and to be finished for the 2011\u201312 season. However, due to the 2008 financial crisis the sale of the training ground was postponed and likewise the remodeling project. In May 2010, Sandro Rosell, then a candidate for president of FC Barcelona, dismissed the possibility of selling the Mini Estadi, saying it would be indefensible to \"sell the crown jewels\", and his election on 30 June 2010 effectively halted the plan to remodel Camp Nou.In January 2014, Barcelona's board of directors rejected the option of building a new stadium due to financial constraints and instead opted to remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000. The project is expected to run from 2017 to early 2021, with a cost of around \u00a3495 million (\u20ac600 million), making it one of the most expensive expansions on a per-seat basis. A refined plan was released in May 2015 showing plans to add a canopy over the stands and showing the plans for seating expansion in greater detail. Construction is currently planned to begin in summer 2020 and to be complete in 2024.\n\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nCamp Nou has been used for various purposes other than football, often hosting major concerts. Pope John Paul II celebrated mass for a congregation of over 121,500 at Camp Nou on 17 November 1982, on the occasion being made an honorary citizen of Barcelona.In 1983, Julio Iglesias played for 60,000 people, in what was described as a \"most beautifully orchestrated\" concert. Other high-profile performances at Camp Nou include those by Bruce Springsteen on 3 August 1988 during his Tunnel of Love Express Tour in front of 90,000 fans ; and again on 19 and 20 July 2008 during his Magic Tour. On 9 August 1988, Michael Jackson appeared at the stadium in front of 95,000 fans during his Bad World Tour. On 10 September 1988, a charity concert organised by Amnesty International to support human rights featured, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'Dour, Tracy Chapman, and El \u00daltimo de la Fila. A concert by the Three Tenors \u2013 Josep Carreras, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti \u2013 was held on 13 July 1997. On 3 August 1988 Bruce Springsteen appeared in front of 90,000 people on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour. He came back on 9 September 1988 to appear in front of again 90,000 on the Human Rights Now! tour.\n\nU2 performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 7 August 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a sold out crowd of 81,269 people. The second and the third were on 30 June and 2 July 2009 during their U2 360\u00b0 Tour, in front of a total crowd of 182,055 people. The encore performance of \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\" from the second 2009 show was filmed for the music video of the single.\nOn 4 November 2014, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which operates France's professional rugby union leagues, announced that the 2015\u201316 Top 14 final would be held at the Camp Nou on 24 June 2016. The Top 14 final is traditionally held at the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, the scheduling of the 2015 Rugby World Cup caused the 2015\u201316 French season to be shifted by several weeks, in turn causing the Stade de France to be unavailable because it would be a major venue for UEFA Euro 2016. The match ultimately drew a crowd of 99,124, setting a new record for attendance at a domestic rugby union match.On 18 May 2019, the first Super League game was hosted at Camp Nou as Catalans Dragons defeated Wigan Warriors 33-16. This match set the Super League attendance record for a regular season fixture, attracting 31,555 fans.\n\n\n== Transport connections ==\n\nThe stadium is accessible from the Barcelona Metro with the closest stations to Camp Nou are Palau Reial, Maria Cristina and Les Corts, on L3; Badal on L5 and Collblanc on L5 or L9 \nL9. All are 500 to 1,000 metres from Camp Nou, depending on which of the gates (accesses) to Camp Nou are used. Usually metro services are increased when there is a match, which causes significant passenger congestion.\nA new station, named Camp Nou, is under construction and will be served by L9 and L10.Approximately 680 metres from Camp Nou there is the Trambaix Avinguda de Xile station (lines T1, T2 and T3).\nCamp Nou is also served by several TMB bus routes, an AMB line, and four Nitbus services. Apart from regular routes, there are two special lines to Moss\u00e8n Jacint Verdaguer Square and to Catalunya Square on days with matches.\nThe stadium is located 13.7 kilometres (8.5 mi) from the El Prat International Airport. It is connected by L9 from the airport directly to Collblanc, which is a short walk from the stadium.\n\n\n== 1982 FIFA World Cup ==\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBall, Phill (2003).

For\u00e7a Bar\u00e7a <3 I\u2019ll go there again and again when I\u2019m old enought to travel at my own. Camp Nou is the place where you have to go if you like football/soccer. If you are going to",
          "Learn the history of FC Barcelona and take a guided tour inside the stadium. Suggest to visit early in the morning when it is less crowded and you do not have to stand the long queue.",
          "Watching the best player on the planet and one of the best teams there is in Football at Camp Nou!!! Nothing gets better than this. You can't keep your voice down, you will want to scream and support your team. Power packed atmosphere, amazing fans and the beautiful game make",
          "I am neither a supporter of Bar\u00e7a nor Real Madrid. However, we set the Madrid's tour as our benchmark after visiting Real Madrid FC less than 12 months ago. Unfortunately, our visit to Barcelona FC did not match the experience we had at Real Madrid in every single way. Our 2",
          "We had a great time touring Camp Nou even bought some of the grass from the previous year as a memory. The whole experience was great if you love soccer and Barca. If you aren't into soccer or this team not sure how you'd feel about the experience. Sitting inside the press box,",
          "Definitely one of the best grounds I've ever been. Great atmosphere and for sure a unique experience!! Really happy and lucky to be there on a match day.",
          "Beautiful stadium.a must to see in Barcelona.nice view of the pitch from the top and interesting tour guide.Consider booking your ticket online.",
          "If Barcelona is more than a club (maybe the soul of the city) Camp nou is more than a stadium, a temple dedicated to the gods of good football. Next time we intend to watch a game. Barcelona x Real Sociedad were playing in Pa\u00eds Basco, unfortunately.",
          "My famyli I had the opportunity to visit this beautiful stadium but i only wish one day in the future to see Barcelona and Real Madrid game..",
          "It's a short walk from the metro train station it's just down a hill there was some fan based merchandise outside the ground and something nice to eat before the tour on the tour you can get an audio self tour video while you walk on the tour its self the official tops are",
          "Wow! It was my dream to visit this place. Unfortunately only for tour in stadium and museum (not a game), but it was unbelievable. The stadium is huge, but from every point, you can see the field nearby. Everything breath footbal and club players: fitting room, press center,",
          "As part of our Stag Party Weekend away to Barcelona, one of the Booked Events we had to look forward to was a Ticket to watch Barcelona play at Home in the Nou Camp Stadium v Real Sociedad only a few weeks ago.Getting to the Stadium was an Experience in itself getting there in a",
          "This was one of the main reasons for visiting Barcelona, I just felt the need to see the GOAT before he retires, so I dragged the wife along for our anniversary. The stadium has seen better days but there is still an aura about it, even with a less than sell out crowd against",
          "Amazing tour. Wouldnt bother with a guided tour, easy to work your way around. Self explanatory. Some bits there are a lot of metal open plan steps so ask where the hidden lift is if you struggle or are disabled. The forced photo area that you have at all tourist spots that",
          "As for Barca fan it was great experience, I could spend there the whole day. I could felt the atmosphere of match. I loved room with movies with big moments, watching this I was enchanted. The only thing I don't like and I'm even a bit outraged it's the price of photos you can",
          "The staff at Camp Nou were so well organized and friendly. The heritage of Barca FC and memorbilia was amazing. Audio guide worked well. Great store with exclusive items you wont get elsewhere.",
          "I attended the museum and stadium tour with my girlfriend (a Barcelona fan). I didn\u2019t expect to be kept particularly interested, but throughout the tour I found myself thoroughly fascinated by the history of the unique icon of world football that is Barcelona. Besides the",
          "Since childhood time I am a fan of FC Barcelona football club (Barca). By travelling this time with my son our dream came through.",
          "If you\u2019re a football fan then this place is a must. It is easy to reach. We got off at the Collblanc Metro stop. There are signs in the Metro pointing to the correct exit. Outside there is another sign point the way. And that\u2019s it. We booked on line and booked an audio guide.",
          "Truly an excellently organized tour. Even if you are not a football lover it is a visit to do because it leaves you speechless. To do at least once!",
          "Inside that stadium you can see the Barcelona's Football Club history and learn everything about Barca. It's just amazing!",
          "There is no question if you are a sport fan you must go to this venue. The shopping alone makes it worth the trip.",
          "Massive highlight for any football fan visiting Barcelona. Easy to navigate & got to see so much. Amazing views from the stands & pitch side. Museum with all the major trophy\u2019s & some fun photos on the way around.",
          "We visited the Nou Camp twice. Once to see a Barcelona game (the main reason for our trip to Barcelona) and once to do the tour. I would thoroughly recommend both. The stadium is iconic and atmospheric. The tour was really informative it was great to learn more about the teams",
          "We only had the basic ticket which actually doesnt get you much. All it gets you is the Museum and you can go outside to view the stadium but that is it, you can not move around inside the stadium. However my husband enjoyed it and it was good to experience the feel of the",
          "3rd time I have done the stadium tour/ museum. If you have any interest in football then you must visit. Just hope my next visit will be to see Wolves play there!",
          "Stadium: Looks much better in person than in pictures. Really good view of the pitch even if pictures make it seem that viewing the game from far side is not as enjoyable. Must visit if you're in Barcelona, if you're a football fan. You can really feel the atmosphere when it's",
          "booked on fc barcelona website prior to going to barcelona but could not do whole tour as it was a match day. We applied for a refund thanks to very helpful ticket office staff and we have had this refunded. We did buy match tickets and had an amazing experience watching Mese",
          "Birthday treat from my daughter/son-in-law and it was a great experience. We did the audio tour which is quite good but the signage for the different commentary points could be far better. When you leave the glitz of the museum though you\u2019ll see the ground is an ageing relic",
          "Nice place, though it's really crowded and hard to get nice pictures anywhere. There is a museum inside full of the awards that FC Barca has won, and you get to go see the stadium, and some other places such as the press conference room, media room etc. Good for football fans!",
          "First class experience . Great old stadium . Security guards not the most helpful trying to find your entry area but we really enjoyed the match . Top tip after the match grab a bar or a restaurant and sit back and let the crowd disappear and then jump on the subway home .",
          "Hes a big footie fan, me not so much. However I found it quite interesting and eye opening on how good Barcelona football team mist be. The phone guide thing is not great, my phone locked after a few minutes of no use and then i couldn't open it to listen to the last few",
          "The stadium was an overall good experience. Definitely a must-do when visiting Barcelona. It was way too expensive for what it offered though. I cant remember the exact price but it included an audio handset and access to the museum of trophies/awards etc and access to the",
          "After coming out of the Subway, surprisingly, there are no signs to point you into which direction to walk to camp nou. A friendly passerby saw how we were staring at our phones in confusion and pointed us in the correct direction. We purchased our tickets at the front gate with",
          "Amazing tour and well worth the price and trip! We paid for the standard tour with audio guide and virtual experience which was great! Stadium is fantastic and museum also! Only thing was the virtual experience was quite blurry not best quality. Would recommend and would visit",
          "Came to watch a match between Barcelona v Real Sociedad as an English fan. Absolutely stunning stadium and a great experience.",
          "Went to watch the Barcelona v Real Sociedad, the grounds were so busy and huge! However the staff were super efficient and made sure each fan got into the stadium safely and quickly",
          "I came hear on Matchday and the atmosphere was excellent the players were amazing and even better to get a win\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
          "We\u2019ve done stadium tours of other major European teams and a visit to BOTH locker rooms was always included but not at Camp Nou. Only the visitors locker room Why? Wish that would\u2019ve been stated in tour description.",
          "My partner found the tour of camp nouveau fascinating. I on the other hand found it boring. If you love you football this is one for you.",
          "Magical place that has nothing to envy of the Stade de France. Free visit very well organized with the loan of a translator with headphones in French. Staff on site very attentive to questions asked and concrete answers. Being able to walk on the edge of the lawn and sit on the",
          "Me and my husband have just visited camp nou with the standard tickets which online for 2 cost \u00a335. The trip was worth the visit, I am not a football fan but it was nice to see such a big stadium and the history behind it and my husband enjoyed seeing all the trophies and tour",
          "There was nothing special about the Camp Nou Experience. The pitch was beautiful and it was interesting to read about the history, however I felt that the tour itself is a bit outdated compared to other European stadium tours. Very expensive for just the entrance into the tour",
          "fairly spectacular stadium (not super new or spectacular....but it is camp nou). Super busy and crowded but self guided and easy enough to see everything we wanted. Quite a big tour and lots to see (very little interactive stuff but if you like football it is interesting). it",
          "My husband and I enjoyed just walking around the outside of the Nou camp. There were no tours available so decided not to go in on our own . Instead we visited the ice rink and watched a veterans game and ate in the cafeteria there...it was great...licensed as well .",
          "Very intersting even if you are not a big football fan I really enjoyed the day. It costs about \u00a325.00 each and took a couple of hours to walk round",
          "very disapointed amature pictures made by unskilled and \"fake smile\" staff. the backgroud scene does not match with our photos, postures are poorly cut make it even worse. Very disapointed, definitely not recommended",
          "I was in Barcelona for the 5th time but first time visiting the stadium. I got the 30e online basic ticket. Stadium itself is most amazing. The whole tour is long, full of surprises, very well organized, despite the situation with the virus. What was kind of bad and certainly",
          "There were sadly no match on whilst visiting Barcelona so we made do with a tour of the stadium. Although it is getting a bit old it is very impressive and the tour route is well organised and signed so it is easy to find your way around. We paid \u20ac6.00 for a handset but it was",
          "As an arsenal fan, seeing Belletti\u2019s champions league winning boots were the lowest point to this experience \ud83d\ude00\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f However, a coach journey up into the hills to this place is well worth the experience ! It\u2019s nice the way there\u2019s not much queuing and it\u2019s laid out so good",
          "Was told at the beginning of the tour we HAD to pay \u20ac6 for an audio guide that was not included in the ticket price. Was able to press 1 for the first part of the guide after which the phone threw me out to a locked screen asking for an administrator password and would not do",
          "Amazing experience for a big football fan like myself, was a breathtaking experience being in the middle of the crowd for a match!",
          "Been here several times but love to come back. Bought out tickets at the ticket office only to be told at the entrance that we only had an hour left to go round!! Why didn\u2019t they tell us this when we bought the tickets, we could have come back the next day. Quite irresponsible.",
          "We booked online through Klook travel definately cheaper to do this than buying there. We booked a basic tour when we got there we were advised to get audio equipment which was 6euros each which agreed was useful. If you want the visual experience it's another 6 euros so best to",
          "Football fan or not, the stadium is full of wow's! It's huge! You can learn the history with an audio tour, or just take a self tour around the grounds. Ticket prices are definitely value for money.",
          "Extremely enjoyed our visit to Camp Nou in February. We completed the audio tour and visual experience which was great. Staff very helpful and I expected people to rush us but they never you can take as many photos and at own leisure. Highly recommend if visiting Barcelona.",
          "We had hoped to see a match but this tour was the next best thing. Great value as we spent nearly four hours there. Pitch side, in the dugout, in the stands, the press box, the tunnel from the changing rooms and the museum. The VR experience was definitely worth it too. Had a",
          "This was my 2nd trip to the stadium having visited Oct 19 for my son's birthday treat. We sat behind the North goal which is Barca fans end. The atmosphere there was great. The hard core fans didn't stop singing and dancing all game long. This game was Saturday afternoon which",
          "What an amazing experience. Watched Barcelona and enjoyed night with a good restaurant and good clubs in Barcelona !",
          "If going to a live game, get there early and soak up the atmosphere. Great facilities at the stadium",
          "The experience of this place is awesome! I understand why they say its more than just a club.....Its a lifetime experience! And the main reason of its being that is the football! Barcelona football club is the definetly one of the best clubs in the world! I watched them",
          "Did not have time for a guided tour but wonderful how allowed to walk around, even to edge of pitch.",
          "Visited here on Saturday 22nd of February with my partner who was celebrating his 30th birthday. Our stadium tour was a gift from a family member that I had booked on their behalf. Arrived at the stadium an hour or so early asked if we could be taken early told no. Wandered",
          "An interesting tour with a guide on a mobile device, not always clear when to use it as the numbers were not always displayed clearly on exhibits. Trophy room was amazing, and the 360 VR headset was very good",
          "We had a great tym going around the camp nou and museum. Its important for every barca fan to know what it feels like to be inside the camp nou and experience it.",
          "On Friday 21st February we bought 2 tickets to visit the museum and the stadium. The tickets were discounted at \u20ac20 each (instead of \u20ac26) because, as indicated on the website, the visit to the stadium would be offered in a limited way compared to the usual due to matches",
          "What an amazing experience. Watched Barcelona play and did the tour and museumm the day after. Absolutely fantastic. Barcelona is a beautiful place too.",
          "Great tour so much to see in the museum alone. Trophy after trophy, Although some appear to be missing around 1982/83!!!! We had the audio guide which we were late starting. You need to have this on as you go in, but even then it\u2019s hard to listen to it all, so we skipped to",
          "Why would you go? It's a beautiful stadium. And the biggest reason is ofcourse Messi. It's bigger then expected. Atmosphere could be better, because of the many tourists, but yeah..",
          "Football fanatic must go to live match!! Wow just wow!! Family friendly! Beware lots of stairs! Amazing atmosphere",
          "We booked ahead online a couple of months before travelling to Barcelona which I would recommend doing as we could pick our entrance time. We are big Barca fans and the stadium just blew us away! Really pleased we made it part of our trip to Barcelona and would highly recommend",
          "We went on this tour because as a Southend fan I thought it would be nice to see a proper trophy room! It was an excellent tour, you get to go on the pitch side and in the press box, and I found the history of the club very interesting.",
          "Terrible experience. Due to them \u2018preparing\u2019 for a match that evening (we visited mid afternoon) we were restricted to the trophy museum only with no possibility of a discount on the price of the ticket and no access to the stadium which was the primary reason for our visit.",
          "Bought tickets direct with Barcelona FC for sons 18th! He loves football. Booked a tour with audio guide and virtual reality experience headgear. Definitely the best ticket! Arrived via metro at le camps on green line and walk direct to Camp Nou with sign posts. About 10 mins.",
          "We are Barcelona supporters and have been before the tour is great and when you get to top of stadium you realise how big it is the game we watched charged with energy very friendly and safe with beer, drinks and food available",
          "My husband and I have visited Camp Nou 6 times, but this was our first visit with the family. Which made it special. We had fairly good seats, and the grandchildren said that it was the hi light of our visit to Barcelona. Yes it is expensive, but making memories for the",
          "Visited this iconic place early morning on a Sunday. Was quiet, but soon got busy. It\u2019s a must for all football fans! The tour itself is interesting, but to see the stadium, memorabilia, trophies and photos is something else. You can spend as long as you like there. Taking it",
          "Growing up in the States i was never really exposed to futball (soccer). My cousin had recommended that we take a stop here on our trip. I have to say that i was very happy that I did. The energy here rivals Yankee stadium, with out the over priced concessions. Barcelona is a",
          "Probably a great tour for fans of the team but 30 euros per person to tour a trophy gallery seemed a bit much. The brand of merchandise in the team shop was next level.",
          "it's not the most modern of stadiums , far from it, but it's an incredible place to watch football - the noise when Barca score is like nothing I've ever experienced before and I've watch sport all over the world - the stadium tour is great to - well worth the money . The ground",
          "First time to Barca, what a terrific stadium for football, sights and atmosphere. So easy to access, clean and above all sublime football.",
          "We have visited Camp Nou previously on a tour, which was brilliant! However, this visit was to see a game. This was an amazing experience. Such a great atmosphere! We were right at the top so be mindful if you don\u2019t like heights!",
          "I was expecting a super stadium compared to others we didnt rate this one much , unless your a Barcelona fc supporter it'll be a day your never forget",
          "I think this is a must-do experience when visiting Barca. However, as a (stupid) American, there were some surprises. There is no drinking in the stadium and tailgating does not exist. I say this, just in case there are any other first time American sports-fan visitors. :) I",
          "Used an official site to book tour with audio and VR headset included only downside they wanted a credit card or \u20ac25 per person deposit on audio headset/phone when entering was not informed of this on buying online tickets But tour was brilliant and VR",
          "I spend three hours to this tour due to short timetable but i could have stayed much longer.I think it's a experience every Barcelona fun should have.",
          "As a die hard fan my young son loved every second of this tour. Changing rooms, press room, tunnel, dugouts, pitchside.",
          "A great day out for our football mad kids, the audio guide was good and the virtual experience was worth the extra cost. Only disappointment was not getting to see the home teams changing room",
          "Fantastic stadium. You can pick up tickets online for most games (except El Classico), or from the official FC Barcelona shops in town. Take metro and get off at either Les Corts or Palau Reial, depending on your entrance: it doesn\u2019t really matter as its only a 5-10 minute",
          "This huge stadium is a thing of beauty. Easy to find and hardly a queue anywhere to get in. A tube station is 10 minute walk away. The stadium tour is great. Very detailed. But there is a couple of issues with it. 1 there is wax no mention of Bobby Robson. The man is a rarity in",
          "If love football or history of big clubs of different sports, it is the place to be. You will feel fortunate with locker rooms, press conference hall and even going into the pitch. A must in your visit to the city",
          "This review is going to be short but what else can a man with his heart bearing for Barcelona can say other than - This is one of my very best and top places to ever visit! Both during daytime as well as during play time!!! Forca Barca!",
          "At the end, there is much to see: you walk thru the whole stadium & its diverse areas after the museum",
          "This is one of the best football tours I\u2019ve had! Just when you think that the tour is over, there\u2019s so much more too add onto it & you find yourself in a different area! The information provided to you is so detailed and in general the tour is just a must do! Amazing!",
          "Although a bit pricey, we spent a good amount of time here and there is alot to see and do. You walk thru the whole stadium including where media personal and sport commentators report on the game. Buy your tickets ahead of time. We had our daughter with us in a lightweight",
          "Amazing experience, worth it!!!!! It is better to buy The ticket online, and The tour Take at least one hour, you Will see The museum, The stadium and a lot of things, lockrooms, shop",
          "Barcelona is one of the shrines of football that I had the opportunity to go on my trip. I am very lucky to see this place. I recommend buying your tickets online. Lastly there was a fee of 26 Euros. By paying this price, you see the museum, changing rooms and press rooms,",
          "My husband loved it, he is a big football fan and it is definitely worth visiting, if you like sports you must go",
          "First time visit there and a spontaneous one too. We stopped outside but didnt know you could do a stadium tour so thought why not. The place is amazing and the staff are friendly .. If you love football you will love this place. So much to see and the 2 hours goes quick.",
          "What a great place to watch a match. The pre match entertainment was also very good. Just a very happy atmosphere also unusually for a football ground the food and drink wasn\u2019t mega expensive.",
          "The stadium is massive and it was great to see it in person, it was def a unforgettable time. Thanks",
          "Nice experience.... Really organized tour... Huge field, great museum full of trophees, pictures, videos etc.... We had an interesting morning at the Camp Nou...",
          "I loved my trip to nou camp to watch the match and see Messi and the Boyz. I went on the weekend of January 17-19. I been lucky to go a few times now. It's a good atmosphere and the staff are really helpful in finding your correct seat. I book my match tickets online which is",
          "Because when you\u2019re in Barcelona, you want to watch a match with one of the best clubs in the world. Soak in the atmosphere of the crowd, band, and the players. And hear the roar when a goal is scored. Barcelona FC supporters should sit around gates 64-73 for the best views.",
          "Tour was interesting and always nice to get behind the scenes. Didn't get into home changing room for some reason but views from pitch side as well as the media area were excellent. Purchased tickets through 3rd party company in 4th tier. View was excellent, stadium staff",
          "Enjoyed tour but buying the photos at the end was very misleading, paid \u20ac40 for one photo in book plus the rest on digital but when got email has to pay a further \u00a324 to download this was not explained at the time.",
          "Fantastic atmosphere and history, major experience. Museum and stadium tour worth visiting allow at least a couple of hours or more",
          "Excellent tour. Little confusing about audio. Thought was included in price. Cost extra. Very informative and interesting tour. If you speak English or Spanish no need for audio assistance. I stopped using it after a few attractions and read the blurb instead.",
          "The Museum is interesting and covers the whole story of the FC Barcelona. The technology is state of the art and user friendly. Then the walking tour inside the stadium is easy and you get to the pitch itself. I have been a Barca fan all my life and a I could not help to get a",
          "Fantastic football ground highly recommended to any football fan and neutral the history like other teams is interesting worth a look always try to book ahead",
          "We are not the biggest football fans but the museum and Camp is definitely worth a visit if you are in Barcelona. The history and information in the museum is worth reading, especially about Cruyff a real legend.",
          "If you visit Barsa you must see a stadium and by a camp nou tour. I want to note that it will be cheaper to buy a ticket online, as I did )) They have free wifi near the ticket window and to do it will be easy. Inside you will find fun shop, very beautiful musem of football,",
          "Great experience watching one of the greats play. Very fun atmosphere in the stadium. One caveat: No alcohol sold in the stadium. I did not know that was the case, it was weird watching a sporting event with a beer in hand.",
          "Even if you are not a huge soccer fan, you should still visit this stadium and watch a soccer match. The atmosphere was fantastic. We were happy with our cheapest tickets even we were sitting pretty high up. Metro station is near by. But after the game the station is very busy.",
          "One of the most amazing experiences of my life seeing a live game in barcelona \u2764\ufe0f incredible just wow\u2764\ufe0f",
          "My third visit here, this time with husband who has not been before. Interesting tour, well kept ground and the place to coem if you want a Barcelona fc footy shirt, there are hundreds of them for sale in a three story souvenir store. Looks lovely and green but then that would",
          "I don\u2019t know what to say. Firstly me and my gf went to Barca - Granada match and it was unbelievable! Then we went to the Barca museum and we were amazed.",
          "Niether me nor my husband like football, but we couldnt skip visiting camp nou during our visit to Barcelona.. It has an amazing atmosphere and you feel you want to watch a match here especially in NC the panaromic view seats.. worth a visit, and for fans, there is a musem in",
          "I particularly enjoyed the walk through the accolades room. Especially the size of the thophies. They were magnificent.",
          "I like football but am not a massive fan and I enjoyed myself. My other half enjoys football a lot more than me, and he found it very interesting. We bought the audio guide but decided we didn't need it. If you're an avid Barcelona FC fan, I would say you don't really need the",
          "My first game and not last!! Absolutely loved the atmosphere, the stadium was huge. I watched FC Barcelona V Granada. Awesome game, will defo do it again. Camp nou was easy to get to by metro.",
          "A UK visitor, felt very welcome! Was easy to get in and was an amazing atmosphere. Really good experience, no faults!",
          "Visited for the third time and was not disappointed. Every time I go I learn something new. The VR experience is worth the extra \u20ac5 and gives you a good feel of what a match day is like if you\u2019re not lucky enough to be going. \u20ac150 to get access into the Barcelona team changing",
          "Visited here to watch Barcelona play, was not disappointed. Awesome stadium, electric atmosphere and fantastic football. An experience everyone should have. Easy to find, stadium tour is worth doing and the area around the stadium is lovely, with shops , bars and restaurants.",
          "Incredibly well organised and a fully engrossing experience for fans. You can literally buy any type of club merchandise from the slick outlets on site, and the stadium tour is wonderful. Just make sure you bring plenty of cash, as it\u2019s not cheap. Best way to get here is on one",
          "This ws one of my favourit tours in Barcelona. You walk around the stadium, you see the museum, all the thropys, and when you acces the field, oh god, it is just breath taking. Imagine",
          "Only went to the shop, but was surprised to see what they have laid on out the back of the shop between the ground and the shop, lots to do for the whole family. and all free to take part in. We really enjoyed it.",
          "Finally got to see a match at Camp Nou AND got to see the great Lionel Messi live AND score the only goal of the game. Took the stadium tour the day before, which was great - being a Spurs fan, the trophy rooms had me green with envy.",
          "This is a bucket list experience! Attended a match! Wow, watching the famous Barcelona Football Club in action, live is breathtaking. Definitely a highlight. Messi scoring a hat trick and final score of 6-1! Also did the Stadium tour! Well organised. I would do it again!",
          "I was not expecting that the trip will be so organised an super interesting. They show you everything, inside out. Worth visiting. I loved it. They even sell old grass of the stadium. Loved it",
          "Brilliant Stadium, good idea not to have a guided tour so you can walk around at your own leisure and explore this fascinating stadium. A wealth of history to be found out about the club and its presidency\u2019s. Lovely staff too.",
          "Amazing! You can visit almost all parts of the stadium, it's very interesting! If you're in Barcelona, you must see this even if you're not a football fan!",
          "This place is breathtakingly big. You can go on a tour around most of the stadium and it gives you a great insight regarding how it must be to see a real match with one of the worlds largest football teams.",
          "What a great few hours touring this monument in football history. Worth the time and cost of the ticket a fantastic experience.",
          "For the people who love football one of the greatest stadium in the world is NEO CAMP . I am sure they would not loose it specially match between barcelona and real madrid !!!",
          "Even though I'm not a huge fan of competitive sport I can appreciate the effort that sports teams put into developing and supporting their champions. Magnificent facilities and show of recognition for the best..not just in football..",
          "Enourmous stadium not far from the subway station. You need tickets to get in and you can buy merchandise here.",
          "This stadium as you should know hosts the best football players to have ever graced Earth: Messi Ronaldo Suarez Dybala Ronaldinho. That is just a few! Defiantly a must visit.",
          "They say that Camp Nou is one of the must see places while in Barcelona. To be honest the place is amazing and the view is great. But it's waaaay too expensive without any reason. I could say that it's mainly for crazy football fans",
          "I had a full day of city excursions planned but told my guide we HAD to go the Camp Nou (for non-soccer fans, this is the home of the Barcelona soccer team). It is very special to soccer fans, like me!! The museum located in the stadium is a MUST SEE for soccer fans.",
          "Im a barca fan so for me it's a dream come true. The Stadium is very big and Fancy for me. The design of the stadium almost look alike Roman Colosseum. You have to go there if you visit barcelona. It is the city's icon",
          "Very nice experience, make sure that u re buying tickets online so you can avoid the waiting. Whole tour lasts about 2 hrs, but depends on how much you spend for details. If you re a big fan, you re gonna stay there all day haha",
          "I was really looking forward to this visit as it was a place I ve always wanted to go to, however I can say that the whole experience was very disappointing. The audio tape was uninformative and did not go in any order.it was very confusing. I felt cheated that we were not",
          "It's the best place to know FBC history and the chance to walk the ground even short area is impressive to us.",
          "My friends and I went to watch a soccer game, and it was lots of fun! Had to walk up a lot of stairs, but well worth it to sit and enjoy one of the fun sports entertainment Barcelona has to offer!",
          "I visited Camp Nou stadium on 26 December and bought photo package over there. The staff promised me that they\u2019d send me my photo to my email after 2 days. Now it has been weeks and there\u2019s still no photo even after my multiple follow ups. I did receive an auto reply saying that",
          "Attractive museum for football lovers (particularly Bar\u00e7a), with history, sports records and trophies plus a spectacular view of the Nou Camp",
          "If you are a Bar\u00e7a fan this is a Must! Easy access... I love FCB and I love Camp Nou. For me the Stadium tour is perfect, from la grada, to zona mixta, press conference room, El pasillo, team bench, virtual reality, press palco.",
          "This is a very enjoyable guided tour. The guide engagement skill is excellent. Even participants who are not so familiar about Barca can understand easily what he explained. Some private/group photos were taken at the press room and at the field during the tour, and up to 2",
          "Home stadium of the FC Barcelona foot ball club and this has left us surprised. Access was easy, directions were clear and the number of gates can easily accommodate the huge crowd expected for a Barca match. Only if we could get to see or click a pic with Messi..... Original",
          "I had chance to go at a match and I was very impresionate. The atmosphere, all was very nice. I like FC Barcelona and I was visited eaven the stadium long time ago. But a game is another level.",
          "A great stadium to tour. So much history to see and read about. The virtaul reality was OK but the graphics need improving. Staff were veery helpful and friendly.",
          "We were able to purchase last minute tickets for 4 to the Barcelona vs Mallorca futbol match. The tourist office helped us and found 4 seats 3 rows from the field. Amazing! The match was awesome and got to see Messi score 3 times. The women\u2019s restrooms need help. No toilet paper",
          "As a die hard Barcelona fan this was a must do on my list. I spent hours strolling through the museum, which takes you through the history of the club and city. You will get to see \"relics\" from the yesteryear but also Messis Balon d'Ors and golden boots. The stadium is pretty",
          "The stadium is large but the renovation can not come soon enough. It is pretty degraded, it's only roofed on one of the four sides. It's a great club with so much history and the tour is quite enjoyable , but after doing the tour of Real Madrid no other club or stadium will wow",
          "You have to pick up your tickets 2.5 miles away from the stadium!!! So I lost the price of admission, didn\u2019t see the stadium, and the agent was a real treat (sarcasm at its highest level) to talk to about it. These will be the last excursions I ever purchase on Trip Advisor!!!",
          "Pro: Staff is very helpful and friendly Cons: We couldn't enter into the Barca's dressroom, as in other stadiums.",
          "Visited Camp Nou for clasico which typically do. Each time gets worse ad they delay opening gates and funnel everyone like cattle into security area. Disappointed this large organization cannot provide more secure measures for the loyal fans. They should consult with big NY",
          "Do I really have to specify!!! Visit before Messi is gone! A must! The atmosphere is amazing and sporting. Sit near the cules and you may not see much of the game but what a hyped experience will you have! Bwahhh!! Tot el camp! \u00c9s un clam!!",
          "Bought tickets to a Bar\u00e7a game online. This huge, well built stadium that holds 100,000 people is so well organised, it is easy to find your seat, the staff are helpful and you see the best footballer in the world. What else do you really need.",
          "We\u2019ve taken special promo Xmas program includes tour, souvenirs and museum Children were excited- less to say",
          "Good experiences for football lover. If you are Messi's fan, then it is a Must to visit with all the collections of his Balon D'Or and golden boots on display",
          "I\u2019ve not played football for 11 years since my knee gave out and since then I\u2019ve lost interest in the game and have not watched a game properly in about 8 years whilst my partner hasn\u2019t cared about football \u2013 ever. However, I\u2019d say that even if you didn\u2019t like the sport you\u2019d",
          "just the most amazing experience as a football fan. The nou camp is easily accessible. The view was incredible from our seats. Staff very helpful. Great entertainment and would highly recommend",
          "Extremely disappointed and waste of money. We weren\u2019t even get to go to the top edge of the stadium to take pictures. This is simply a room with trophies. If it\u2019s your thing then go otherwise save your money to go out on a nice dinner.",
          "This is the second largest stadium in the world. The most wonderful is museum with trophies before the entrance of the stadium.",
          "Arrived at the Stadium to find the tours weren\u2019t going ahead. Only options were come back another day or very limited tour as the museum was closed. Never received any email to advise this either.",
          "It is a must see for all football lovers. Nicely organized Stadium Tour takes you thru' all the club museum of trophies, its rich history, the interactive touch screen allowing to watch the greats in action of one's choice. one gets to watch the complete stadium, the players'",
          "Have done the tour a couple of times which is fab however we went to see the match whilst in Barcelona this time- brilliant atmosphere, great view, good price! Definitely recommend. Got a taxi there and back across town, was \u20ac15 each way and definitely a good way to get there!",
          "As huge fans of the team and sport, our family enjoyed touring the museum and beautiful stadium while visiting Barcelona. Better yet, as our tour happened to fall on a game day, we were offered discounted game tickets! We couldn't pass up the opportunity. My son said it was",
          "I have to say that it would be a serious omision to those who leave Barcelona without visiting Camp Nou stadium. It worth your time! I've been in the exhibition room & store for a half day.",
          "First time at Nou Camp stadium with my husband and son to watch our team FcBarcelona against Majorca on my birthday 7dec.We came from France and my son didn't know where we were going for the night until we start see the fans heading for the stadium.A dream come true for all",
          "We visited on 17th December for my son's birthday. Travelled from the UK on the 16th and already had the tour plus booked. Barca have known for weeks that the match would be played on the 18th and sent me an email telling me of restrictions to the tour at 17.30 on the 16th! When",
          "Arrived at Barca stadium for the tour experience to celebrate my husbands 40th Birthday, to then be told the tour was not operating today. Thus meant no access to the visitor dressing room and to the pitch itself. We could only view the stadium from the higher tier and access",
          "Watched a football match. It was Easy to get to the stadium by public transport but once there not easy to find seats",
          "Great day out at the Nou Camp , not expensive and great pictures to take at a real great stadium of the world",
          "if you cannot attend a whole football match, just visit Camp Nou and you might see one of the stars arriving or leaving. It has something magic when you are close to the football field.",
          "all explained well and great experience I enjoyed it very much . I will recommend it to my family and friends.",
          "Camp Nou is the stadium of Barcelona football club, one of the main places in Barcelona city , the huge stadium one of the biggest stadiums in Europe , all the trophies for Barcelona FC are there & the The legend Leo Messi golden trophies. Even if you are not football fan it",
          "Going to see Barca play is an amazing experience. We've been three times. You can arrange everything online. Be prepared to pay some serious money and see amazing football. There is no alcohol served in the stadium, so plan on drinks on the way in one of many bars. The Metro is",
          "first of all, its great to visit the stadium, to see everything we've seen on the tv. the camp nou itself is impressive and tour is thorough that alone worth the visit. but the entire experience felt over merchandised it's like they only wanted us to spent more money and to buy",
          "If you love your football (soccer) then this is a must! Make sure you prebook your ticket.. Best way to get there is via the metro, getting off at either Collblanc or Badal and making the short walk. The stadium and surrounding area are signposted in English which directions to",
          "It's a must visit if you are a football fan, and if you are not - you will like it! Time is just gonna fly away here, you'll be amazed with history, trophies, greatness of stadium. Overall, worth every cent we gave.",
          "We went to the stadium and also went to a game! Uplifting environment. Liked the store! Loved the game!",
          "Visited to watch the Mallorca match fantastic experience and Messi hat trick made the match... although Suarez back heal goal was amazing too!!! What a stadium and the crowd are so proud of the Barca Team",
          "Almost skipped it, but I am glad we didn't! The feeling of watching such an important soccer team was fantastic! We got seats in the south area, but the \"local true fans\" you know, the ones signing and dancing the whole time were in the north area! Wish I was there! Would",
          "It was really awesome experiment .Very good that u can go visit the stadium also. Many interesting infos about history.",
          "Saw Barcelona play at home. Fantastic. Genius football great players great stadium. Good experience. Did stadium tour and museum tour. Well worth the money if you are a fan or not. Only negative comment is around Bobby Robson as their manager in museum. Cruyff mentioned and",
          "Excellent experience, a great show for football fans. An unique experience in the house of a club with a big history.Mes que un club (more then a club) is a real conclusion after the visit. Also we had the chance to watch live the greatest player of all time , Lionel Messi .",
          "Went with husband and two grandsons 10 and 8. Well organised. Large museum with lots to see. Sat in the stands and press boxes. 3D film very good. After 3 hrs I was footballed out.There are only so many silver cups you can view.!!! Lads thought it was great and would have stayed",
          "I have been at the stadium on a match day many times before. But to do the Camp Nou experience tour was a plus. You start with the museum and the. You can visit the areas at the Camp Nou that you can not visit on a game day.",
          "We purchased the cheapest tickets but felt it was great value for the money. You get to see Barca artifacts and many trophies, as well as different areas of the stadium and an easy, no hassle and relaxed way. Good fun even for those less passionate about the team",
          "Despite being one of the biggest football stadiums, it's very easy to enter, even when the crowd is big. Very safe atmosphere.",
          "You don't need to take another tour. The basic tour o believe is enough for seeing the camp nou. I believe that the cost of the fotos are too expensive . The store is ok but too expensive also. You can find all the staff at the city centre.",
          "Stadium tour was absolutely amazing. However I had massive problems booking tickets online, leading to being charged twice. Went through the VERY slow process of getting my money back and I am 4 months down the track and still have not received a refund. The process to get",
          "We had a great time - my son really enjoyed this tour, seeing the whole change rooms (no photos allowed), going up into the press rooms, the VR experience were all great. Our tour was about 90 minutes, then we went into the museum - I recommend you allocate 2-3 hours at least...",
          "I was in Barcelona by myself and being a football fan, I had to visit the nou camp. And, it didnt disappoint one bit! Loved every single bit of it! If you are like me who knows the history of the club already, dont buy any other tours and translation etc. just get the normal",
          "If you are a foot ball fan, it would be a dream come true watching a champions leage match at Camp Nou, featuring FC Barcelona. Even if you are not a football fan, the architecture and setting of this great stadium under the lights at night would be absolutely dazzling for you.",
          "Great few hours spent at Camp Nou. We aren't huge Barca fans but appreciate the importance of the club and now am in awe of some fabulous players. It was interesting seeing the changing rooms, the tunnel and the immensely impressive ground. Sit in one of the seats and try the",
          "Was nice to see the stadium but in side was so limited on where you was aloud to look and see, couldn't go near the pitch, wasn't even aloud in the home changing room. Who wants to see the away?",
          "Best experience ever. It's a must see in Barcelona. We've got the basic tour and it was amazing. The museum was absolutely fantastic and the stadium...no words to describe. #ilovebarcelona",

          "Went here a few weeks ago for the Celta Vigo match. First time seeing messi and Barcelona and he scores three goals . A great experience . We paid extra for the better seats . Well worth it as great view of the pitch",
          "The most important thing to visit in Barcelona, you can visit camp nou , take photos with trophies, buy Barcelona FC t-shirt from store ,it was great experience",
          "Must visit to this one of a kind stadium. Get the seats above the players box bit pricey but worth it",
          "Best time of my life!!!! Highly recommended :) watching Barca at their home is magical, a life time experience for soccer fans",
          "I bought the tour as a birthday gift for my partner. We had a really great time. Great for adults and families with kids.",
          "I wouldn't say its the best place I have ever been in terms if museums, though the Camp Nou museum gives you a point of you to Barca history - and how this incredible club became to be \"more than just a club\" It tells you about Gamper the one who founded the club to Barca un",
          "An absolutely amazing experience to visit this amazing football stadium and museum. A must visit for crazy football fans. Book the tickets online to avoid queue. A memorable experience.",
          "I Estuardo Santillan... travel accrossed and the ocean and finally made. I was on the field at the Cam Nou... I couldn't even breath... I couldn't talk.. I was completely mesmerized... I took the VIP tour ... and did not disappoint at all.. I couldn't beleive my eyes... this",
          "Was left speechless. Amazing stadium. Paid \u20ac29.50 and made my own way around in my own time. No time limit. I believe that the more expensive tours are not worth it",
          "This place is huge ! Very well thought out museum showing some spectacular pieces. Even for a non Barcelona fan this is a must see. Seeing the stadium after the museum was just wowing. Includes changing rooms, press box and pitch. Recommend the extra for VR tour which is fun.",
          "Fantastic to see the history of the club, the stadium is brilliant. The megastore has masses of souvenirs to buy.",
          "Good fun. The tour was well sign posted and from the trophy room onwards good fun. The staff could cheer up a bit but perhaps that's just a culture thing. Missed having photos and buying the hideously overpriced merchandise.",
          "We were lucky enough to find tickets for a Champions League game and it was absolutely worth it. The stadium is in really good shape and got in in was pretty smooth.",
          "We bought the tickets at the gate with a voucher from the Hop on Hop off bus. The doors open at 10am. We did pay an extra 6 Euro each for the audio which I think is a must as it tells you lots of info even though the museum has lots of reading material. The tour is the museum,",
          "Amazing tour, we all spent over 4 hours here and worth every Euro, so enjoyed the whole experience of the tour, photos, club shop etc, highly recommended to visit one of the best teams & stadiums in the world, real highlight of my weekend stag do.",
          "Not much to add that hasn\u2019t already been said about this footballing Stadia, take the tour and see the sights, it starts in the trophy room (quite big & full of an incredible amount of history) and ends in the club shop!! Takes you to just about every accessible area including",
          "Loved it it was absolutely amazing every part. The look on my step sons face was priceless thank you",

          "We recently visited the Camp Nou for the Stadium tour & Museum experience. We booked our tickets online a couple of weeks prior and printed them off at home - e-tickets could also be used via your mobile device. We got to the stadium for the selected time, and there were 10 in",
          "Very impressive, the tour of Camp Nou was very informative, and any football fan will be in their element. Lots of steps so anyone with walking difficulty should search out the lifts.",
          "I ran from the city centre to the stadium because I wanted to take a closer look at it. Sadly it was all locked with gates. I knew I wouldn't be able to enter the actual stadium, but I thought I wouldn't be locked outside the gates. I've been to many stadiums in England, and",
          "Accompanied my husband during the Tour to the Camp Nou stadium and FC Barcelona museum. Though I'm not a football fan the tour was interested for me, a good experience to learn the history of the legendary club. Reccomend!",
          "We bought tickets for the for the Camp Nou tour and museum, when we arrived we were informed that the tour was not available. When I requested a part refund (for the tour) at the ticket office I was informed that my options were to book an alternate day but given that I was",
          "This Tour was amazing. Got to enter the stadium and check out the locker room. Would definitely recommend to a Barcelona fan",

          "We purchased tickets via official FCB site, paid by credit card but the tickets never arrived, but only a confirmation email of the payment without the tickets. 228 EUR have been deducted from my account wrongly, this was 11 months ago. In this 11 months I tried to contact the",

          "Amazing atmosphere and fantastic arena,seeing messi score a hat trick was the icing on the cake,as expected very busy leaving at end of match even though we left 5mins early and struggled to get a taxi but highlight of the trip",
          "Good value But for the financial and brand I expected better and fancy setup However, for fans it is for sure a must see",
          "Easy access from Las Ramblas where we stayed and was a must to visit. Witnessed a Messi hat trick which was nice. Atmosphere was average and seemed like everyone was more interested in eating their baguettes. Maria Cristina station was mobbed on the way back so we walked up",
          "Remarkable experience 1 of my dreams came true,awesome atmosphere at the game also unique experience next day when we visited the museum and the stadium!Highly recommended is absolutely incredible!",

          "Probably the best football tour you can have in the world. The museum is full of memorabilia. You get to go into the stands. Unfortunately, due to match day we were not allowed on the ground floor but still enjoyed the tour.",
          "What can I say, a dream of a lifetime that did not disappoint. Went to the Celta Vigo match and the G.O.A.T. Scores an amazing hat trick. The atmosphere was out of this world and hearing some 70,000 fans belt out the Barca anthem give you goosebumps. Followed up with the Camp",
          "Both Dad and son would reccomend paying the stadium a visit, metro stations nearby, an experience not to be missed.",
          "Tired stadium and we weren\u2019t even allowed in the home dressing room. We paid extra for the audio tour and it was confusing and frequently it was difficult to see where we were. Expensive and certainly not worth the money",
          "shame as when we visited few days ago a match was on and could not get seats and think as winter season touers not so plenty but will return took some good photos thpugh but twil return when not clossed for night time match",
          "A wonderful tour with so much to see and do. A wonderful packed tour especially the trophy room. Suggest you get to the ground early or book tickets on line ahead before your visit to avoid the queues.",
          "Really good to see all of the silverware, have a wander around the stadium from the dug out, to the dressing room and many areas of the stand. Highly recommended for any football fans.",
          "The stadium is very easy to navigate with signs everywhere. The rows for seating were missing a few plaques which made finding our seats a little harder, but not too difficult. The stadium is well lit, and the field was green and well kept.",
          "Camp Nou is undoubtedly one of the most famous sports stadiums in the world. It is home to FC Barcelona one of the world's most successful sports franchises. Though not very knowledgeable about soccer I attended a game to see what it is like. I found it to be much more",
          "Growing up in the states, i never really focused on soccer. Coming here has made me a soccer fan! Messi is praised like a god and i can see why!",
          "We visited Camp Nou as part of our trip to Barcelona! My middle one is training football and taking her to this place was like heaven! It's a magical place, you can feel the atmosphere even no match for the day. Pick up the first slot as it gets really busy later on, especially",
          "I would recommend the Camp Nou tour if you are Barca fan or not. I am not a Barcelona fc. fan but I really enjoyed the tour and could appreciate the rich history this club has. After spending so many years watching games on tv it was great to experience the stadium in person and",
          "You can not be in Barca without taking a visit to the stadium. Even if you do not like football there is history in this visit and atmosphere in this stadium.",
          "Wow, what an atmosphere. The views are amazing and the feeling is special. We have lived in Barcelona for 4 years and we love comming here",
          "Been to attend a game with my boy in October. Great place, facilities great, we sat on lower level in corner and had a great view ( ceiling was low), lots of food and drink options. Toilet facilities good too. Went back the following day for a tour, good value, spent a good few",
          "It's a must visit for football fans. My wife and I are not much into football, but we still enjoyed the place.",
          "This is a must for any football fan! What an amazing stadium with some great history. We did the guided tour which was great. My son was blown away!",
          "The Camp Nou tour experience is very well constructed overall, but there were a few things that could have been done better in my opinion. 1) Good job with making us aware that people can not tour the locker room if there is a futbol match. 2.) If a match is rescheduled; it",
          "On a recent visit to Barcelona I was out for a run and came across the football stadium and there was a game on.... It was a place I had wanted to visit so I could see Barcelona play and tick it off that \u2018bucket list\u2019. The staff around the stadium were very helpful. English",
          "Lots of history in museum and tour was very good, if you are just looking to get good pictures and not worried about hearing the history of team. Don\u2019t get the multimedia package which is extra money, the virtual experience in the stands was very good Tour is on your own so you",
          "This stadium is breathtaking. The Barca fans are truly the most passionate I have ever seen. The stafiumvand museum tour is recommended. If your able to or willing to give it a go, then they also have an ice rink for skating. If possible- I would highly recommend buying tickets",
          "Fantastic stadium. Fantastic football. Limited food options so eat before the game. Ladies take tissues with you as facilities do not provide toilet paper. Seriously expensive indulgence but a Barcelona must do! An experience of a lifetime.",
          "A very easy to get to Stadium Lots of space at the gates, everything perfectly organized Friendly security and amazing experience Highly recommended if your kids dream about seeing Barca and Messi in front of you Pls visit the Camp Nou Museum and VR experience. Worth every cent",
          "This was one of our trip highlights. We are huge football fans and although Barcelona isn\u2019t our favorite team they certainly have had great success. Their trophy case is full and they have many things to see and do at Camp Nou. You can spend a lot of $\u20ac\u00a3. My suggestion is to go",
          "Check! Another bucketlist item! Wow, this is a true unique experience! Every stone is this stadium breathes top class football. People eat, live, breath football here. Numerous guides, staff and security help you to experience an amazing football evening. And with Maestro",
          "it is too expensive and you will not see something special. better goo on barcelona match it is chiper and you will not miss enything plus you will see the players.",
          "Recommend that you upgrade to the 'Tour plus' if you were originally considering the basic tour. Informative audio guide and VR experience included. Photographers at the stadium will encourage you to stop in the hope that you will buy the souvenir photos but there is no",
          "Great paket, great experience, not to pass, kids love it, great value of money, great pictures and gifts",
          "I'm so glad I came to visit, my boys loved it. We included the VR experience which was great. Loved going right up to the top even if it didn't do much for my vertigo!",
          "Nice experience. A lovely evening in company of the Barcelona supporters. The beer is alcohol free and few eating choices ( sandwiches and chips).",
          "Our visit was hurriedly done and we missed most of the museum and camp nou experience. \ud83d\ude14 Next time pls book early morning slots.",
          "We visited the stadium as a birthday treat for an 8 year old. The stadium itself is quite impressive but the surroundings are a bit \u201cdrab\u201d and uninviting. Don\u2019t do the last tour of the day particularly on a Sunday in the winter months as the length of the tour is cut short",
          "Book to avoid disappointment. We booked for 1000am and there were queues to get in. The stadium is big and lots to see. You get to see the away dressing room but not the home one which was only downside. Happy we went and great food on site",
          "Two young kids and soccer fans had a great time in the Camp Nou. Experience of the FCB dressing room and the fields will remain in their minds for a long time.",
          "Mixed feelings. You take pictures and charge 15 euro each. Selling grass\ud83d\ude09 from the pitch.Should more multimedia and real feelings of the match.",
          "We couldn\u2019t book in advance as we didn\u2019t know when we were going so paid on the door. We were charged an extra \u00a310.50 for three tickets which I did think was excessive. We all enjoyed the visit though, there seemed to be lots to see. The trophy room, the dug out, the stands etc.",
          "Simply awesome. If you are a FOOTBALL fan, there is no choice , you must go. I know it sounds silly , but absolutely do the Virtual Reality in Spanish, you wont regret it",
          "The theatre and drama witnessed on this hallowed turf is probably some of the greatest known across any sport. Home to (arguably) the greatest player of all time. Even a visit not on a match day is worthwhile as you still get to appreciate the achievements of this sports team",
          "mush be really impressive during a match; I did visited it empty but even like that the place is spectacular (even for people who do not like football) worth a visit if you have time",
          "It was terrible! On this day I had tickets for El Classico. My wife and I spent a vacation for this, it was very difficult to buy tickets, We got from Siberia for three days. It was my dream to see this football, and you showed me an empty field of a \"camp nou\" and empty stands.",
          "The place is very well organised for tours and there is a constant stream so waiting time was short. Lots to see and 2 to 3 hours well spent. Shop is very expensive but tour is good value.",
          "Huge stadium and easy to get to via metro! Great experience for all the family to watch some of the worlds best football players",
          "If you like football you can not miss Camp Nou! Best stadium in the world with the best player on the pitch ! Lionel Messi \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udd1d",
          "Was a very good tour but was on the 5 o'clock one but found it was a bit rushed x easy to get to on metro x plenty of photos to be taken",
          "Camp Nou is without doubt an amazing stadium. However we didn't realise until we were there that the 'Tour' isn't a tour as such but you walk yourself round the various areas. This was very disappointing; having taken a few tours of English Premier League teams the Tour Guide",
          "It was amazing. Even though I\u2019m not football crazy, I went here for my son and it was the highlight of his trip to Spain.",
          "Interesting. Son loved it. Queues a bit long but saw more than I thought I would. Book in advance. Great for football fans",
          "this was one of the best experiences in my life and i cant wait to be there again in a football match. i enjoyed it very much ! VISCA BARCA !!",
          "Best stadium I have ever seen.The tour was excellent and the place itself was great. Easy place to get to and easy to find.",
          "Came with our 6 year old. He loved exploring all the behind the scene areas and surprisingly the visual experience was worth it too. Don\u2019t think you really need the audio guide. Only bad comment is how many people are let on the tour at once, this was only really an issue in",
          "You might believe this is a men - boys visit only but actually at the end everyone enjoys, also the girls. The museum is very nice and apart from the clubs history, you learn also a lot about the Catalonia history and culture in general",
          "Disappointed by the visit to camp nou. 1. I had purchased tickets for 1.30pm entry and virtual tour 3 months in advance for my Sunday 27 OCT visit. Nowhere while Booking did it mention that the camp closes at 2.30pm on Sunday's. Only when we entered the stadium did the guys",
          "Visited Camp Nou and it was a great experience and memories. The tour is very easy and self explanatory. I wish that there was a match at the time I visited",
          "It was amazing\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d I really enjoyed the time in Camp nou. I almost crying\ud83e\udd23 This biggest stadium is gonna be alwalys in my heart. Forca Barca!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Do book in advance as you are unlikely to get a ticket if you just turn up. We had the audio guide and VR experience. Worth the extra. You can wander at your own pace. Overall we spent about 2 hours. VR is well worth the extra. Overall a really good trip. Interesting",
          "For football fans its fantastic! Dreams come true. Im here. Great place having so high energy level. Especially on match!",
          "Barca tour have two options. Option two has sound hide and virtual camera. For me the virtual reality was good but the sound guide is useless. Made photos were fine we ordered the digital album for 30 euros. Its has all the.pictures but not the paper a hard cover paper album.",
          "A must for any football fan but for >30 euro basic price the place does not look very good value. Admittedly, the museum looks fantastic, but the rest could be arranged better. There is no admission to the home dressing room and there are charges for guides, VR experience, even",
          "I came and watched a game a few years ago for less than \u20ac20. Now it cost more for a visit. The ground is ugly and you see nothing from the outside. Unless you are prepared to pay to go in, don't bother. Barcelona has changed from welcoming and open to fenced off and charge for",
          "My son is a huge fcb fan and we brought him to Barcelona to visit the nou camp. He was in absolute heaven here and loved every minute.",
          "Took my son to Camp Nou last week and we were disappointed that the tour was self guided. I did the tour around 12 years ago and there was a guide which was much better and brought the place to life. Also such a shame that you're not allowed in the home dressing room!",
          "Nice tour all over the Camp Nou stadium, even in the basic package. Visitor is feeling the excitement and the era of a living legendary football club. Recommended also for not football fans as it offers an overview of the club mixed with historical events. Sometimes you may feel",
          "Must go place in Barcelona. It started on time and was very organized. Great tour with a great guide!",
          "Wonderful to visit Camp Nou. It take a good couple of hours to do it justice. Pitch side was the best bit for me and not sure if the VR experience was worth it but fascinating to see the history and behind the scenes. Would definitely recommend",
          "As a Barcelona fan since a little kid, it was a dream come true to visit The Mythic Camp Nou. Amazing experience even though a little expensive the tour fee.",
          "For the price the tour was average. Lots of opportunities where they tried to get even more money for guides or photos. Staff were RUDE, unwelcoming, unfriendly. We were herded through and not allowed to enjoy each stage in our own time. Not good value for money.",
          "Pre-booked tickets, no issues, smooth entrance. Audio guide reasonably easy to use, though mine kept resetting. Ear piece was annoying though. Great to see all aspects, press room, locker, pitch etc. We also pre-booked the 3D experience which we were looking forward to, but",
          "We took the \"Players Experience\" tour and were very impressed! This tour gives guided access in English to the entire stadium, including the pitch and locker rooms. Like soccer? GO!!!!",
          "Excellent tour. Much more than I had expected. The tour covers the whole ground from pitch level to commentary box at the top. Highly recommended.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Camp Nou, I thought it was well worth the money. We paid for the basic tour and got an audioguide as extra which was great for learning about the history at various points! The display of all the trophies and cups throughout the years is amazing",
          "Don't miss watching a football match at this cathedral of sport! The pre-game parade outside the stadium is worth the trip, all by itself!",
          "This tour is such a waste of money - \u20ac29 to be herded like cattle through the stadium and to be asked for more money throughout - \u20ac6 for audio guide - more money to have your photo taken at various points throughout the tour. I learnt more about the history of FC Barcelona on",
          "Being a lifelong barca fan, I am likely biased for this review. The experience was fantastic! The club has set up a great tour which is really well organised. They have a nice clothing and gift store at the end also.",
          "This is a fantastic stadium. You can see a football match here. Worth a visit and watching a match in this Camp Nou stadium.",
          "Had to check out this massive stadium \ud83c\udfdf. Tour was good they were missing some champions league trophy\u2019s. Oh wait thats because Real Madrid has them. All in all it was a great experience",
          "On holiday in salou we decided to take our wee boy to camp nou stadium tour and boy we wernt disappointed we firstly booked through bus plana in our resort for a family of 4 this was 153 euros which included a two hour stop in barcalona city centre....the stadium tour is",
          "Pre booked tickets online , swift entry. Our son throughly enjoyed the tour - highlights for him were = museum & trophy\u2019s , VR experience & pitch side dugout . The audio ear piece not very child friendly, too big for child\u2019s ear & club shop extremely overpriced.",
          "We did the audiovisual tour - the audio guides were interesting but ended up not really using them. The virtual reality experience was worth it to get a sense of what it is like at a match in the stadium. Overall it was interesting to walk around but no more than a tour of any",
          "Tour of the grounds was ok nothing special I expected more. Best part was the audio visual experience.",
          "This was a great place to visit. My young children loved the experience. The virtual tour was the highlight.",
          "I arrived an hour early for my tour, but was able to go in straight away. There is not a lot of signage where to go, and no one on hand to guide you. Once in, there are a lot of green screens, to have your photo taken, but not many of them are manned unfortunately. The audio",
          "It was a phenomenal experience. Our Guide was Friendly, and was really passionate about the experience she wanted to give us. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better tour than this!",
          "Booked this for my husbands birthday, there is so much to see and do on the visit. You get a inside look into the stadium and the numerous awards and trophies the team have won. I was pleased to see the amount of community work Barcelona do in Spain and around the world.",
          "Ive been lucky to go to the nou camp a few times over the years as I get tickets for the games and I always do the tour. You also have the megastore close by were you can buy alsorts of Barca merchandise. The nou camp it selp is truly magnificent and you can really feel the",
          "Even for a non football fan this was a breathtaking experience I highly recommend it!!! Reasonable at \u20ac23 each for the basic package which is all you really need !",
          "I\u2019m not a soccer guy, but this is a pretty cool place with a lot of history. If you\u2019re looking for a place to visit in Barcelona to kill some time and you love sports in general, Camp Nou is worth the visit. They have kept years of trophies, clothing articles, and history of",
          "We enjoyed walking around the different levels of the stadium, changing room, press room, and TV broadcaster suites. The value is worth spending.",
          "Visit on Camp Nou was fabolous! Our Kids enjoyed, it was fantastic. The whole building, the museum, the whole experience is sothing you can not miss while visiting Barcelona!",
          "Very informative tour with English speaking guide. Get to see home dressing room, which you don't see on normal stadium tour. You cannot take pictures in home dressing room area, pity. You do get some goodies to take away as souvenirs, which is nice, but thought we might get all",
          "This was a really cool tour. I would recommend to everybody who loves football. We have several parts of the stadium. The Tour was very informative.",
          "I have been to lots of college basketball, football, pro football, hockey, basketball, baseball and even US pro soccer and I have to say the experience of seeing a game at Camp Nou and the absolute fun atmosphere of the fans and game is awesome. An experience so diferent from",
          "Great atmosphere. Like a party! Best to be there as neutral fan as otherwise it would be a painful evening!",
          "Amazing day out , easy to get to from train station just followed google maps on my phone, took about 20min . Fantastic place kids loved it and so did I , bit different to tours in uk where you have a guide with you in small groups , here you just walk around freely which is",
          "Any futbol fan will love the experience at Camp Nou stadium through a game or a stadium tour! We did both and would highly recommend either. The Player Experience Tour was great as it takes you through what a new player would go through when they sign with the team! We saw",
          "This was the first football stadium I've been to, and in spite of not really being a soccer (sorry, football) fan, it was a very cool place to be. To see some of the locker room area, get on the field level, sit in the stands and on the bench, you can get a feel for how powerful",
          "Worth every cent. Beautiful expirience, we walking around pitch ,seating on stairs, going to museum , making a pictures around . It is very good tour , I would recommend to everyone",
          "Always a must do - go there and enjoy the story of one of the greatest football clubs in the world. Enjoy and remember to see all the stuff with our hero - Michael Laudrup \u270c\ud83c\udffe\u270c\ud83c\udffe",
          "I took my football mad son for a tour. We did the basic tour on our own without an audio guide. We may have benefited from an audio guide but we enjoyed our time there. The tour explained the history of the club and seeing behind the scenes, like the change rooms, was",

          "Great stadium if a little dated. Left to your own devices on th tour unlike some other stadiums I could mention. Not rushed in then out. The Megastore was a little on th pricey side so if you've got kids expect ur wallet to take a hefty hit...!!. Overall though well worth a",
          "We enjoyed this tour of the iconic stadium. Highly recommended for anyone. Seeing behind the scenes - in the tunnel, press room and pitch side was great.",
          "Great to watch a match of Barcelona playing with anyone. Be careful what stands you choose, there is a reason some tickets are more expensive - you actually see more of the game.",
          "awesome place to visit definatley worth it.... we visited here because my partner likes football so he loved it... however i found it interesting and not at all boring consodering im not a massive fan of football.... one thing i will say is that it seemed more like a MESSI hero",
          "This was a great activity to do and is reasonably priced at \u20ac30. I was a little disapointed that you couldn't go home team dressing room as this would have been good to see. A good tip would be to order tickets online from the website, as it's \u20ac6 cheaper and saves queuing up at",
          "The highlight of my trip to Barcelona. Whether you choose to have an audio tour or just go at your own pace, the place is absolutely incredible and it would be an absolute dream to go back to watch a game,.",
          "Its a really big experience to watch a match live in Camp Nou. Nothing to do with a match on TV. Camp Nou ambience was superb.",
          "Amazing place! One of the best experiences for football fans, especially if you cheer for Barcelona!",
          "We assisted to a match between FC Barcelona and Milan team . The biggest soccer stadium in europe full (100,000 people) . A very fun evening.",
          "I had booked two tickets a while ago for me and my son to go and watch a game at Campnou In-between the time my walking had got bad and I was struggling . I went to the game with my son really expecting to have to wait for him outside as having been a few times before I knew how",
          "Fantastic day at Camp Nou today. Incredible stadium, tour and impressions. Have been here one time earlier, but still no game though. Next time! One of the biggest clubs in the world, and they live up to it, with their arrangement.",
          "This place is just amazing, not just a football club, its a religion. i was surprised just how much access we had.",
          "Awesome tour at FC Barcelona Camp Nou. You dont need a guide nor an audio guide because there are explanatory posters at all places. Be sure that it will be very crowded. Overall, its an amazing feeling to be standing inside the stadium. The megastore is very pricey",
          "Booked for this the day before. However when we got there we were told that there was a match that night and we could only access the stands. No entry into the locker rooms or pitch allowed. Surely they knew that the day before. In comparison to Anfield and the Emirates Stadium",
          "Attended match at weekend in Nou Camp excellent experience not for faint hearted whilst attending a match but highly recommend....left to own devices to make way to stadium so u would need to check buses, trains etc & pre buy your tickets because match day 80,000 thinking same",

          "We booked a match Barca v Sevilla and it was amazing. We got our seats through the official Barcelona Fc website. We then booked the tour for the next day using their website again. Highly recommend for any lover of football.",
          "Visited the stadium with my husband who is an avid football fan. The tour itself was great. We were given audio guides for the language you required and you took in the sights at your own pace and time. Outstanding stadium with a great club history.",
          "Wasn\u2019t really impressed truthfully, no effort made to really show the stadium off, certain areas were not accessible ie the conference room home team changing room. The museum was really lacklustre with only pictures, they were selling \u2018Barcelona grass\u2019 at every turn and all",
          "FC Barcelona store goods are good quality, colourful. Surrounding areas clean. I enjoyed the place very much.",
          "In need of a lick of paint and a refurb. For all the history it's only a great stadium from the inside. Outside its just a big slab of concrete adorned by Messi, Saurez and co.",
          "Must see and would certainly return in the future to witness a match. Amazing environment and blows all other stadiums out of the water with the sheer culture and history of this club!",
          "I absolutely loved the tour! I got the players experience tour and the price Is definitely worth it. You get 2 professional photos taken throughout and also get a backpack. You get access to places around camp Nou that other tours don\u2019t. This was the highlight of my whole",
          "Outstanding stadium for its sheer size. I was able to buy a champions league ticket a few days before when they played Inter. Must visit if you\u2019re a football fan. Make sure there\u2019s a match on during your stay. We bought the cheap seats and they were good enough without",
          "Inspire of the fact that we did a group reservation for the visit 2 weeks prior to our visit, they cancelled our booking on last minute and we had to cut down our stay there and didn\u2019t visit the inside due to an upcoming match on the same day. We paid 27 euros per person to see",
          "You can spend a good 2 hours here seeing all the history of the team and then going down to the pitch level.",
          "Very nice visit at Barcelona FC museum and stadium! The prices for souvenirs are a little bit high! The store is very nice!",
          "Wow it's so high - we went the day before the champions league match between barca and inter Milan so there were loads of coaches there but they looked tiny compared to the building- we'd booked a tour which gave free entry to the museum - we got to look out onto the pitch & see",
          "Firstly, i am a Real Madrid fan (arch rivals of Barcelona) but before that i am a fan of football and any fan of football must make a visit to the camp nou if they are around. The musuem was great, not huge but enough to see to keep you interested, the stadium itself is massive",
          "What an amazing experience first attempt in camp Nou as a fan , incredible view, I cannot describe my experience, i just want to say if you come to Barcelona don\u2019t forget to attend a match or take a tour in this great castle \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Amazing place to visit even if you aren\u2019t a football fan, the museum was great so many trophies to view from over the years. We were told upon arrival that the changing rooms and pitch side tour was unavailable due to them setting up for the champions league the following day",
          "I\u2019m a Barza fan and I got to do the museum and panoramic view tour of the stadium. It was incredible to be there. That same day we got to go to the Barza vs Inter Milan game and it was a breathtaking experience to feel the f\u00fatbol passion of the people of Barcelona.",
          "Visited with my husband and he loved it, tick in the box for him. We did the tour ourselves but if you want to hear all about the stadium etc then guided us maybe best.",
          "Hearing 110,000 catelans sing their national songs is something you have to experience in person. Icing on the cake is some of the best soccer players in the world. Try to make it for a real Madrid or juventus match. The earth and walls will literally shake from the sound",
          "When you know your stepping on something this historic the feeling is out of the world. The entrance fee is fine however looking at the photos being clicked by professionals to offer to be sold at the entrance simply makes it feel very commercialised and doesn't make it feel",
          "Went on the tour and it was just amazing. Veryu slick and ver well done. The Nou Nou Camp looks like it will be out of this world.",
          "I Love football and it was first destination while setting up my itinerary for Barcelona. Its amazing experience to take a tour of Camp Nou and shop for official merchandise from ground zero. I wanted to stay for game tick the item off my bucket list but could not fit into my",

          "Visiting Nou Camp was a wonderful experience for us.Stadium, Museum , pitch, history, changing rooms all great.Going up to the top to the media and private boxes and watching the pitch from there absolutly amazing.Overall we had a wonderful time there.We can highly recommend it..",

          "Very good and I'd 100% say that this is the highlight of the holiday.the children enjoyed it and had the opportunity to check out the VIP rooms",
          "Even for a non-footy fan, this place is great! There weren't too many crowds when we did the tour, so plenty of space to wander at your own pace. Note: there are lots of steps to negotiate, but there are lifts that take you UP, but didn't seem to be available to take you down",
          "Saw Barcelona v Villa Real. Purchased tickets before our holiday from official Barcelona site. Was disappointed we didn\u2019t get 2 tickets together. The stadium wasn\u2019t full so felt this was unnecessary. I contacted the club who said it wasn\u2019t guaranteed to sell tickets seated",
          "Did not know what to expect , however found the tour very informative and then looking round the ground and behind the scenes was excellent. We then followed up by watching a game , to savour some of the atmosphere, excellent ... and seeing Messi play even if it was for 45 mins",
          "The trip was awesome, left to walk around at your leisure access to all areas absolutely superb, so much to see used the tube got off at St Cort and the walk was no more than 5 minutes",
          "We went here to watch Barcelona beat Villarreal. We were sat on the half way line but in the top tier. It was a great experience. We had perfect views of the whole stadium and even the view of the pitch was good considering how far away we were. Would definitely recommend",
          "Originally we plan to go for a tour, but turns out there is a game next day and we decided to go to a game instead! There are so many Barcelona official store in the tourist district and you can get a jersey and ticket there, or simply buy online. So... undoubtedly the arena is",
          "I have to start by saying that I was scared senseless to attend an FC Barcelona / Valencia CF game in an arena this large. My husband dragged me while we were on vacation. And I loved every minute. It was fantastic -- respectful, family-oriented, and all about the game. Unlike",
          "I enjoyed the Camp Nou tour immensely, in spite of being somewhat lukewarm about soccer. We tagged along with some friends who are rabid Barca fans and I\u2019m so glad we did! The tour was interesting, the museum is great and the stadium itself was impressive. We enjoyed ourselves",
          "The temple of football. A place to be visited. Rich history, victories, top players, cups, Messi. But in front of all, you can really feel why Barca is \u2018more then a club\u2019. And also the stadium is just phenomenal. All part of it. Highly reccomended.",
          "Two weeks ago my daughter and I decided to do the Camp Nou museum and stadium tour. We bought the tickets online the previous night and it cost us 25 euro each. We took the metro which is very convenient and a short walk to the stadium. It was a gloriously sunny day when we",
          "Very interesting experience. The museum is in limited space ( for the 120 years of the club) and without enough light for such big successes.",
          "All my life, I have been huge FC Barcelona fan. It was in my bucket list. I\u2019m glad I did it. In saying that I can tell you for sure that Football fan or not you will love this experience.",
          "You can\u2019t visit barcelone without going to the Camp Nou which is one of the most iconic and fabulous football stadium ever made.",
          "After being a fan of Barca for 30 years, I finally gave myself (and my family) the chance to visit Camp Nou, Barca's legendary near-100.000-seat stadium. The visit, also enjoyed by wife and children, took about 100 minutes. We were photographed in different circumstances along",
          "We went to see a game and it is beautiful easy to enter and easy to leave well organized and clean, highly recommended",
          "We are mad on football so we knew we would enjoy this but the tour had so much more. A great history, lots I didn\u2019t know about Barcelona as well as all the silverware and the recent successes with the likes of Messi. Some interactive parts too which would have made if",
          "Went to watch Barcelona play at the stadium as part of my husbands 60th birthday celebrations. We went as a family of 4 including our two children (22 & 23) My daughter and I had never been to a football match before (we're English and it's never appealed to us.) I have to say",
          "First class well worth very penny pure football at its best was at the game the night before when Barcelona played Valencia the place was rocking then the stadium tour the next again afternoon was just incredible What a pleasure is was",
          "Camp Nou is much larger than I expected with so many photos and memorabilia for soccer fans to enjoy. I thought the grass was imitation - it isnt! It was funny to hear the Spanish accents - succa . Accents make a word sound so different eh. Luckily I realised as I thought they",
          "Even if you don't like football, the experience of Camp Nou is unique! We went with our children 17 and 12 years old and almost spent the whole day there. Don't miss the virtual reality experience ,it's really nice. We took tickets included the audio guide and we didn't spent",
          "Great visit ... museum very good. Next time I will watch a match!!! Only the costs of photo was too expensive",
          "A must see if your a football fan . Easy to get to .Very busy so prepare for a bit of queuing. Tickets easy to get also",
          "Excellent tour and museum would highly recommend. Also was at the match the previous evening, that\u2019s a must",
          "The stadium is huge!! The experience of watching a match is amazing.. the energy and enthusiasm in the crowd is contagious",
          "Had a great day seeing the Nou Camp! Would highly recommend great to see the Stadium of Barcelona FC.",
          "For a football fans, a place to visit in Barcelona, the vibes are excellent, the stadium tour is something you cannot miss.",
          "Wow. We bought 2 tickets on the day of the match, expensive costing \u00a3100 each and those where the cheapest up in the 3rd tier. I\u2019ve done a visit to the stadium 20 years ago but always wanted to go to a game. The seats despite being high up where amazing. The atmosphere before",
          "It\u2019s great and simply great The vibrations you get is beyond description and truly this is one of the key monumental visits in Barcelona The only sore point of camp Nou is the super expensive store which sells the official stuff of its club T shirts are priced well in",
          "We paid for a basic tour and were allowed to see all the additional parts such as standing on the pitch and changing rooms. We bought tickets on the day. Only had to queue for around 30 mins. Plenty to eat and drink in the grounds. This is a great day out even for those who are",
          "We bought tickets on line for the flexible time tour which enabled us to visit the stadium on any day after 2:00 P.M.. We chose this option because we were only in Barcelona for 4 days and it gave us more flexibility. The tour started in the museum and ended on the field. The",
          "As a fan of FC Barcelona I of course had to go visit the stadium and the museum, its an amazing experience, they have alot of things you can see and its very recommended!",
          "As someone who isn\u2019t into football this wasn\u2019t on my top list of things to do, however, it is spectacular. We did the normal tour (\u20ac26) and just walked around at our leisure, which was as good enough for us. There are other options where you can do VIP tours which I\u2019m sure are",
          "An in-depth insight to one of the great football teams. Sit in the stands. Walk down the tunnel to the pitch side. See the trophies theyve won. For any football fan this is a reasonably priced stadium tour.",
          "Camp Nou stadium where FC Barcelona play must see.It's the simbol of Barcelona everyone should see the stadium and his greatness.",
          "we visited the Camp Nou with friends during our trip to Barcelona and although it was a quiet expensive sight-see, we strictly recommend it!!! it had an amazing museum with all Barcelona's history and trophies, we could visit all the stadium inside and take a lot of photos",
          "Great family day out my four football mad sons aged 3-11 loved the whole football experience great tour and virtual reality experience. Highly recommend",
          "This was a very surreal experience walking on the grounds that Messi, Ronaldinho, Eto, Xavi and Co have given us life time memories. A match day experience would have completed the dream. The only downside was the over priced official pictures.",
          "Bought expensive tickets to the Messi Challenge for the children. It was only 3 very quick activities and nothing special at all! Totally overpriced. Went to the tour of the stadium afterwards, very crowded and chaotic. We literally ran away from it, it was so bad. We could not",
          "Spent about 2 hours here on the tour. Good tour. Museum is busy but good. Audio tour numbers in random orders so gave up in the end. Lifting champions league trophy was cool. Very expensive for pictures. Stadium is huge but was expecting something more impressive. Easy to get",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the stadium. Could have done without the hard sell photographs on the way in but if you are a football enthusiast they make a nice mimento",
          "We throughly enjoyed our tour of camp nov Very interesting Well managed and laid out Good transport links Worth seeing when in Barcelona",
          "It is worth the price. I have been to Camp nou many times. I love it more with evety new visit. Great muesum and attractions.",
          "We loved visiting the Barcelona stadium! My youngest son who's a huge fan of some of the players was in heaven. Of course, we had to get a jersey and lots of photos. Great day for kids!",
          "We loved it. Everything was as expected. My boy is an FC Barcelona fan do we are biased. We couldn\u2019t fault this stadium.",
          "A good day out and reasonably priced although i would give the fotos a miss just get someone else walking round to take them",
          "Well structured, safe environment. Well mannered \ud83d\ude01 supporters. Lots of respect. Left the car at hotel to go by tram. Woman with 2 teens having good time. Viva Barca.",
          "Wonderful football court suitable for all ages.Civilized environment.Relaxed atmosphere easy to get there",
          "Definitely try and catch a Match here. The passion of the people before and during the game is amazing. The talent on the field is also fantastic no Messi tonight but still great night.",
          "This is a very popular tour. It is done in a grand way. The camp nou staff is positioned all through and iy helps keeping the tour in order. Press area is accessible which was not the case in barnabou tour .",
          "Loved it. The excitement hits ya the minute u walk around & then hit the entrance. Great that u can walk it at your own pace. All the trophys specially the champions league cups & Messi. I was amazed when i got to the pitch. Wow. Keep up the good work FC BARCELONA.",
          "Great idea with gargoyle.For a few minutes I saw the whole history of the club plus the amazing impression of being in the stadium and see it from a bird\u2019s eye view",
          "I just think it is too much to pay like 35eur to see empty stadion. It was not big queue and the drinks in the bar next to ticket office are reasonable priced.",
          "My husband and I did the stadium tour with our 8 year old son and 5 year old daughter and we all loved it. The fact that it is self-guided means you can take as little or as long as you like to look round. We had the audio guide which provided lots of extra information, photos",
          "We bought tickets ahead for this tour and took the Metro there from our Air B&B. We got an early tour (9am) but it was still full so I would suggest early as it was packed by the time we left. There was a large museum full of trophies and medals and old uniforms. We had",
          "We did the self guided tour of the ground and museum costing around 35Euros each. Barca is one of the most famous and successful clubs in the world and they have the motto \"more than just a club\" and it is impossible, as a football fan, not to get wrapped up in the history and",
          "Was able to convince my fiance to go to Barca's first home match of the la Liga regular season. Although Messi was injured and didn't play, Antoine Griezman and the rest of the team still put on a show and we got to witness 7 goals in the match. The atmosphere was something",
          "As we were in spain we decided to go to see the Camp Nou. We found out that Messi, suarez and Dembele were all injured and not playing and were going to give the game a miss. But later found that Real Betis were staying at our hotel and we got to Meet the players on arrival",
          "My experience is to book at the ticket office as I made the mistake of booking on line with my bank card on the official Barcelona web site. When I got home the bank had informed me that they had took 2 payments, I tried to contact them via email as to rectify the mistake and",
          "This was a great experience my 13 year old son loved it. The museum is good but I felt one thing was missing and that was there was no mention of Sir Bobby Robson, they seemed to have skipped all reference to him. For me it seems a little disrespectful as he did so much for them",
          "The audio tour is boring and useless and there were supposed to be numbers dotted around the place to correspond with where you were in the place but we couldn't spot half of them. But the stadium itself is fantastic and you get to see the away changing roo and the press room",
          "If you visit Barcelona you cannot miss Sagrada Familia and Camp Nou. A historical football stadium of one of the biggest teams worldwide. A museum full of cups and medals full of history. You can also visit various locations of the stadium.",
          "Wonderful experience!!!You are left to enjoy the tour at your own pace.There\u2019s plenty to see, wonderful trophy\u2019s and history of the club on display.i would recommend virtual experience even though it could have been longer.This will make you want to come back for more and watch",
          "A must do is to take the tour of camp nou stadium. You get to explore the whole stadium even the pitch, worth the money and my son loved it. Try the virtual reality experience it\u2019s \u20ac6 and is amazing and there is a bar outside which was very nice.",
          "We have love watching Barca team in TV for your and finally made it to Barcelona. We had the tour first which was guided. Guide explained well the history of the team but feel was a bit rush so we have to go back and take our time. We were able to take pictures in iconic places",
          "Such a lovely football ground to visit! Booked this tour online and was worth it. As a manchester united fan i still enjoyed and appreciated all the trophies and the lovely pitch. Takes you around an hour or so to view it and there is alot to see! Enjoyed to football view from",
          "The tour is good but we had an incident at the Virtual Reality zone where a member of the staff literally pushed us out while we were waiting our children to finish the experience. When I questioned her as to why we have to go out while other people were allowed to do so, she",
          "Loved the place. Very well organized. I was like for two hours but worth every penny. Definitely must to go if you are soccer fan.",
          "This is a must see it\u2019s a great experience . It\u2019s busy but really worth it if you like football. I would totally recommend .",
          "Me and my mum just went on a tour around the camp nou and it was excellent. First we walked through the entrance, which had a man face painted from top to bottom getting photos in the boiling hot whether with a shield and a football. When you walked in the was shop after shop",
          "We enjoyed the day, great that the club opens its doors to public, a little expensive for what it is but had a good time and my son enjoyed himself. The audio is ok if you want the history of the club but it was not necessary, virtual tour was ok and filled some time;",
          "We enjoyed our tour of the stadium. There was a lot to see and do. We loved the photo opportunities and to be able to get so close to the field!",
          "I hate football but found the stadium interesting... Totally buzzing son too who loved it. We had audio tour which was hard to follow. Interactive goggles were excellent",
          "Husband and teenage son had a VIP tour and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it, they were allowed in to see areas that other members of the basic tour were not allowed in to. At the end of the tour they were given a Barcelona back pack and photos of them on the tour. My",
          "We actually visited it during August 2017. I certainly had adrenaline rush. Its difficult to control the excitement when you set your feet on that place. You kiss the UEFA trophy....can you believe it? If you go to Barcelona and you have time to visit only one attraction, I",
          "Very well organised and superb tour allowing you access to field and press room. Kids loved it. Great to get so many fab photo opportunities",
          "Even though it was only a \u201cfriendly\u201d match between FCBarcelona and Arsenal, the spectacle of viewing these top tier teams in this incredible stadium was well worth climbing dozens of staircases to sit near the top of the highest rows!",
          "Well we were in Barcelona and could not resist the temptation to tour this iconic stadium! We greatly enjoyed the visit and we would recommend the basic tour and possibly the addition of the audio visual experience. I would avoid the photos and other additions which add to the",
          "First visit to the Camp Nou. Quite some place to experience even if you aren,t a big football fan. The stadium itself was a little run down in my opinion however apparently several miillions are being spent in upgrades in the coming years.",
          "very impressive tour ....stadium is brilliant . prices in the mega store needs to be more reasonable to tour members",
          "It is pretty special to see this pitch. You can see it from ground level, the upper stand and from the height of the press box. The museum is interesting but I think they may have a player called Messi? Messi this, Messi that,but I suppose he is quite good! The history of the",
          "Must Visit Camp Nou When in Barcelona Buy your tickets online and enjoy the history and journey of the club!",
          "First visited here to watch Leeds United vss Barca back in 1971 and have great memories of that night and the atmosphere seems to be soaked into the fabric of the place.",
          "It was amazing and worth every single cent we paid I felt much more loyal to this Catalan team than before after this tour",
          "Good tour , let u feel the atmosphere of the club, on the other hand... a money machine to maximize your purchasing The museum is impressive",
          "The whole tour in Camp Nou(+VR)is amazing.And exactly the time you get the field from from the changing rooms is so unique.",
          "If you're a hardcore Barca fan, no one will stop you from making the pilgramage to the Camp Nou Temple. But for anyone else, save your time and money. Worried about what you'll be missing? Just big store, an overpriced tour, and lots of come-ons to get you to spend. Want an",
          "One of the main spots that my teenage son had to see in Barcelona. It\u2019s great value for money. You can choose whether you want to buy the photos at the end. The employees are very helpful and explain everything for you. Great atmosphere",
          "Myself, husband and 10 year old son visited last week whilst staying in La Pineda. The tour was booked at an excursion through a local company. The tour itself took us 2 hours (basic tour) however it could have last longer but we had to get back to the bus. My son who is",
          "We did the cheapest tour (around 25 Euros each) and I think it was good value. The stadium is huge, and you get to go to the different tiers so you get a sense of the scale. There were lots of unexpected things, like artwork by Joan Miro advertising the club. We were annoyed by",
          "We visited the nou camp and to be honest I was dissapointed. You get two hours free time un Barcelona before you go to the stadium but to be honest it's not really enough time to do anything other than have a nice lunch Barcelona was beautiful well what we seen of it anyway, we",
          "Amazing stadium tour. Well planned and set out. A brilliant way to spend a good few hours. Only moan...As a parent with small children I couldn't understand why they thought it would be a good idea to charge \u20ac120 for a football shirt??",
          "It was amazing. Kids loved it an enjoyed very much. The best part was museum and the shop. There were lot of stairs, going up and down but the staff was very helpful and nice. It is expensive but we enjoyed it full time.",
          "Too many tourist attractions: photos, grass to sell, too short and not very interesting 3D Glasses moment. Too many people in the same time. Not explained that we would'nt visit the FC vestaires, but only the visiting team one. Food and drinks to sell inside the stadium is so,",
          "We opted for the guided tour to make sure we got the most out of seeing this amazing stadium and we were not disappointed. Our guide offered great insight into its history and an excellent knowledge of the team as well as as the stadium. I would definitely recommend taking this",
          "Great tour an opportunity for soccer lovers to experience this amazing brand, we took the self guided tour (don\u2019t waste your money) the VR is worth while, note that the best pictures will be taken by them and the cost is from 40 euro for an album to 69 euro",
          "But...quite overcrowded especially in the first section with the history of the club and trophies. I got the headset for \u20ac6 but it wasn't really worth it as most of the stuff you can read and you don't get much benefit from the head set. Great to learn about history of the",
          "A bit pricey for the entrance but a must for any football fan at any age. Also includes the most comprehensive gift shop for true Bar\u00e7a fans.",
          "a nice journey inside camp Nou ! the visit is very well organized and planned ! beautiful experience for the kids !",
          "As a family we had a great experience touring the museum with the audio guide, lots of informative about the clubs history and the trophy cabinets were impressive. The stadium tour was great too, learning about the future plans and the virtual experience is highly recommended.",
          "I'm not a football fan but my husband is a huge fan . This stadium is awesome you will never see anything like it ! You can look round the whole of the stadium from sitting looking over the pitch to visiting the changing rooms . Amazing experience and a must of visiting Barcelona",
          "We were amazed at sheer scale of the Nou Camp, or Camp Nou as it should be called. The organisation is superb and the thought that has gone into the experience has left no detail to chance. The history is proudly on display in an easy to understand layout. Not just the football",
          "My son is a big Barca fan and when we were in Barcelona we had to go to camp nou. Looks big and nice from the outside. But the museum is confusing and quite a waste of money in this google age. They charges extra for audio tour and gave us headphones. But in the museum nothing",
          "Really enjoyed this tour- we went for the basic and thought it was excellent. I don't even like football but found the history of the club fascinating.",
          "I\u2019ll put my hands up and say I\u2019m no football fan- so this visit was never for me. My brother wanted to go- and as he is disabled I took him as part of our holiday. He enjoyed it- the stress was mine. Very disabled unfriendly. Firstly, there are lifts to upper floors- but as",
          "To make the most of your money you\u2019ll have to actually like football and have hours spare in the day! If you\u2019re tight on time it\u2019s worth seeing it from the outside too",
          "My husband and I went on a self guided tour of the museum and the ground whilst in Barcelona. It is very interesting, both the museum and the tour even for a non football fan like myself. The ground was not looking its best as they were returfing it in the closed season. Even so",
          "Fantastic stadium but very crowded, would be better if they done timed visits with fewer people as very difficult to view displays,It is just geared up to make as much money as possible,Photos very expensive and you should be given the choice to either buy one photo not a",
          "We went to the stadium on a self guided tour organised by our hotel about an hour away. The museum may have been a bit boring for young children but the actual stadium itself was amazing. We went the day after the Bar\u00e7a vs Arsenal match which meant that there was still a lot of",
          "This is a well designed tour, we took the basic package with headphones, this was good enough. It does get busy so get there early if you can. The first section is about the history with a ridiculous number of cups on display, if of interest you could stay in this section",
          "I\u2019ve done the tour before about 7 years ago but wanted to do it again. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to see the Barcelona teams changing room, we saw the away changing room but that was it. Disappointing. Not sure if we just missed it but we followed the ropes around. Although you",

          "Wonderful stadium, great museum!!!! History of football is here!",
          "This is one of the best clubs and best place for football. The stadium is huge and beautiful. The stadium tour is for 26 euros. They do not show the changing room of home players. Besides this, everything about the stadium is amazing. Great experience!",
          "Nou Camp tour was great but I purchased an audio guide which was a waste of time and money as there were meant to be numbered signs throughout the tour that you activate on the device as you move through, but I only saw 3 the entire time. \u2026",

          "If you could get to watch a match, please do. The view is brilliant from all over the stadium. Laterals are the best place to watch it from. Seats behind north goal are worth getting just because of the atmosphere. Stadium tour is worth experiencing. So much history at the stadium. Lot of trophies!!",

          "Good place to visit, tour was okay, tons of audioguide spots if you buy it. \n\nVR experience was different, but not really worth the extra money. Stadium shows its age and the tour doesn't take you through the home dressing rooms which was disappointing. Worth a visit if you're a footy fan though.",

          "Amazing stadium, best I've ever been to and I'm a United fan so that's saying something! Looks very unimpressive from the outside but inside is just incredible. Love that its sunken, even sitting in the highest seat in the stadium you still have a great view of the pitch. Would love to go back to do the stadium tour some time.",

          "Messi was the best! I love campnou!",
          "Not really my thing, it was included as part of the package. They said you couldn't help but be impressed both by the stadium itself and the comprehensive way the self guided tour takes you round almost everything from top to bottom. Allow \u2026",
          "Great experience. If this is something you haven't done but want to try give it a go.",
          "I'm not really a fan of football, but I went because my partner is. It is a nice and spacious stadium. The admission ticket price was a little higher than expected. It was around 35 euros and if you want to use their tour headset it cost \u2026",
          "Great first time experience",
          "Away sector is terrible. You can see pretty well the game, but for fans? Crazy.\nSecurity guys of the stadium are nice,but police not.\nAnyway I hate Barcelona and the atmosphere here is terrible, no home fans.",
          "It\u2019s so impressive when you enter the stadium. It\u2019s huge, beautiful and the city looks great from it. It\u2019s a must when you are in Barcelona. It\u2019s also great to watch a game.",
          "When I\u2019m Barcelona you absolutely have to turn the stadium!!! It\u2019s amazing and the access you are able to have is really cool!!!",
          "It's a huge stadium. We loved the match and the security was very clear about the seats and entry",
          "If you are a Bar\u00e7a fan this is a Must! Easy access... I love FCB and I love Camp Nou. For me the Stadium tour is perfect, from la grada, to zona mixta, press conference room, El pasillo, team bench, virtual reality, press palco.",

          "No amount of words are not enough to describe the atmosphere in the stadium! It's ethereal experience and something that everyone should experience on their visit to Barcelona! Vis\u00e7a Bar\u00e7a!",
          "fc Barcelona Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"M\u00e9s que un club\" (\"More than a club\"). Unlike \u2026",
          "Went here with the wife as she wanted to see the tour great walk around",
          "Awesome museum, camp Nou a little old but still impressive",
          "Compared to the Real Madrid Stadium, this lacked passion. Museum was set up weird. You didn't get access to the home dressing room. You didn't get to walk around the pitch and behind the goal line. You still got awesome views, but not as great as Madrid for the price you pay.",
          "Nice i want to go more than 1 time",
          "It's a must visit for all the barca fans out there.. The stadium experience will literally give you goosebumps. With the fan club leading the way, the stadium just roars.",
          "The Player's Experience tour was amazing! The guide was so knowledgeable and likeable, and it was fun to experience every part of a game day. So many great pictures!",
          "It was a champions league game and it was pretty nice. Someone actually sat in my seat but when I got there he politely left. Great atmosphere. The only thing is I saw people smoking inside the stadium which seemed odd but maybe it's \u2026",
          "A must visit place, just take a ticket in advance to sabe some bucks. Awesome people from Barcelona and everywhere else",
          "Any sports loving person will thoroughly enjoy",

          "Very nice experience, you can see a small museum, walk through the changing rooms, press room, in and out of the stadium. In the end, is a big shop with everything you need. I am not a football fan but I like the story about the club.",
          "Camp Nou stadium and the museum is fantastic tour! FC Barcelona is one of the most successful football clubs in the world. Even if you're not a big football fan, the stadium tour will still impress you. During the tour, you will learn more about the club's unique story",
          "So much lovely ground and lots of love from nepal",
          "One of the prettiest stadiums in Europe. The club has tremendous history which you can experience through the tour. Not guided tour is about 30 euros, which was kind of surprising as last year I visited Alianz Arena in Munich and for the \u2026",

          "An amazing visit it's so impressive.  All the trophies to view are fabulous and when you walk down the steps onto the pitch it's an awesome feeling. The museum is v interesting n would cert recommend",

          "home of fc barcelona.. what a massive space that is able to fill up to a hundred thousand people.. it is a place that is also very historic as it have seen the best games in the history of fc barcelona. i suggest to try the xamp nou \u2026",
          "Amazed at how well set up this place was for handling crowds",

          "Absolutely amazing experience. Spent roughly 2 hours wandering around the museum and stadium, but could have easily spent another 2. Loads of things to see and plenty of opportunities to buy souvenirs and take photos.",
          "The location is nice, easy to get to. And its maginificent to see the building from outside. Altough you really should pay money for tour of the inside, as the outside got boring fast. Only thing to do then is order a overlyexpensive meal from the restaurants in the facility",
          "An amazing day out with the family, well worth the money so much to see trophy room, changing rooms, sitting in the dug out walking through the tunnel, the virtual walk is worth including.",
          "Cute! I think we went on a day it was closed but still fun because of the international soccer games going on at the time. It was also really cute because there was a local soccer game with young kids so the soccer spirit was in the air!",
          "Fantastic experience for Barcelona football club or mere soccer fans. One of the biggest soccer stadiums of Europe and a club with a big history of success. Access to the players locker room and stadium if you choose the player experience tour. A must for anyone who loves football",
          "Impresionante! Enjoyed a game here, just brilliant. But we also just did the tour - absolutely fantastic. Best stadium tour we've ever done. Allow at least two hours if not more time, to really explore everything. If you can, pay the extra \u2026",
          "Really enjoyable tour - we did the basic one but you still get great access to walk around the stadium, including the museum, the away team dressing room, the dug-outs next to the pitch and the press box high above the stadium.",

          "Amazing stadium and amazing club! Worth going once in a lifetime at least!",

          "The tour was better and more comprehensive than expected.",
          "A beautiful experience. We took the special guided tour. It was a small group. We had special access to the Barcelona home dressing room, the ground, the sitting area. Camp Nou proved that it is more than just a football club.",
          "The best tour I have ever witness",
          "Not as good as I expected.  The your was good enough but you was constantly dodging other tourists whe were doing there own thing.",
          "I guide a lot of students groups around the world.  Only a fan or someone who\u2019s never taken a half decent stadium tour would give this experience a positive review.  Tired old stadium with meandering path that seems designed to take more \u2026",
          "It's Camp Nou. It's awesome. More than a stadium, an experience. Almost like a theme park. Getting a cab or Uber out is almost impossible. There is a good lot off the diagonal if you drive.",
          "Not much else to say for soccer fans. One of the biggest clubs of our generation (and more), and on a night with a Messi goal.  Hard to beat.",
          "A great and full experience, you can see the stadium from everywhere, near the field, in the middle and the top. You can also visit the press room and the player's changing room.",

          "Impressive stadium. Recommend taking the tour.",
          "As a football fan - although not a Barcelona fan - this is a must place to visit. It's like a holy place for any football fan, the atmosphere, the crowd, the chants, the colours are beautiful, you cant go wrong. Must visit in Barcelona",
          "I bought tickets in advance and paid extra to be able to go onto the pitch. At our scheduled time we were told we could not go on the field. The ticket clerk told me he could not help. The ticket supervisor said it was a different \u2026",
          "There's nothing like this stadium in the entire world! The experience and thrill of being there is like none other. We had a chance to checkout the game vs Valencia and had a blast. My only gripe was the lack of amenities in terms of food \u2026",

          "OMG! Bucket list place for every football fan. Not just bigger, much bigger than any other in Europe and brexit",
          "Watched Barcelona play during winter season good atmosphere and barca fans put on a good show. The stadium is massive its so big that of your at the top tiers you pitch really looks small. So seating is important if want to see the action \u2026",
          "One of the greatest stadiums in the world. Unreal experience to watch Iniesta\u2019s final game in a Barca uniform. Barcelona is and will always remain the city of football. The Camp Nou is a special place, filled with life, great fans and good football. Will be back many more times.",
          "Fantastic experience, even if you're not into football. The opulence, investment, belief in success and sheer vision of this place is something to behold. Interactive museum is great.",
          "so beautiful and its a good place to know picasso",
          "This is a stadium that all football fans must visit. It gets 3 stars because the food inside is garbage sausages and basic drinks in an environment that feels like a nuclear bunker. Also before the game is over the food stands are closed \u2026",
          "What a stadium, largest in Europe and amazing to look at. I went for a game (good stmosphere) and the tour aswell which is probably the best football tour I have been on in terms of information provided.

        "wiki": "The Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana (Catalan pronunciation: [p\u0259\u02c8law \u00f0\u0259 l\u0259 \u02c8muzik\u0259 k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8lan\u0259], English: Palace of Catalan Music) is a concert hall in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Designed in the Catalan modernista style by the architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, it was built between 1905 and 1908 for the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0, a choral society founded in 1891 that was a leading force in the Catalan cultural movement that came to be known as the Renaixen\u00e7a (Catalan Rebirth). It was inaugurated February 9, 1908.\nThe project was financed primarily by the society, but important financial contributions also were made by Barcelona's wealthy industrialists and bourgeoisie. The Palau won the architect an award from the Barcelona City Council in 1909, given to the best building built during the previous year.  Between 1982 and 1989, the building underwent extensive restoration, remodeling, and extension under the direction of architects Oscar Tusquets and Carles D\u00edaz.  In 1997, the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with Hospital de Sant Pau.  Today, more than half a million people a year attend musical performances in the Palau that range from symphonic and chamber music to jazz and Can\u00e7\u00f3 (Catalan song).\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Palau is located in the corner of a cramped street, Carrer Palau de la M\u00fasica, and Carrer de Sant Pere Mes Alt, in the section of old Barcelona known as Casc Antic. Most of the other prominent modernista buildings, those designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, for example, are located in the chic 19th-century extension of the city known as the Eixample.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nThe design of the Palau is typical of Catalan modernism in that curves predominate over straight lines, dynamic shapes are preferred over static forms, and rich decoration that emphasizes floral and other organic motifs is used extensively.  In contrast to many other buildings built in the modernisme style, however, it must also be said that the design of the Palau is eminently rational. It pays strict attention to function and makes full use of the most up-to-date materials and technologies available at the beginning of the 20th century (e.g., steel framing).  As Benton (1986, 58) has pointed out, \"To eyes unaccustomed to the architecture of Barcelona, the impression of a riot of ornament lacking any logic or control seems overwhelming.  And yet the building follows exactly the exhortations of the [architectural] rationalists.  The structure, in brick and iron, is clearly expressed.\" Actually, its walls are the first example of curtain wall structures.\nThe wealthy citizens of Barcelona, who were becoming ever more sympathetic to the Renaixen\u00e7a at the time the Palau was built, asked its architect for building materials and techniques that symbolized the Catalan character.  In response, he commissioned and gave great creative freedom to a variety of local artisans and craftsmen to produce the fabulous ornamentation, sculpture, and decorative structural elements for which the Palau is famous.\n\n\n=== Fa\u00e7ade ===\n\nThe rich decoration of the fa\u00e7ade of the Palau, which incorporates elements from many sources, including traditional Spanish and Arabic architecture, is successfully married with the building's structure.  The exposed red brick and iron, the mosaics, the stained glass, and the glazed tiles were chosen and situated to give a feeling of openness and transparency.  Even Miguel Blay's massive sculptural group symbolizing Catalan music on the corner of the building does not impede the view into or out from the interior (see photograph).  As Carandell and co-authors (2006, 20) have pointed out, in the Palau \"the house as a defense and protected inner space has ceased to exist.\"\nTwo colonnades enjoy a commanding position on the second-level balcony of the main fa\u00e7ade. Each column is covered uniquely with multicolored glazed tile pieces in mostly floral designs and is capped with a candelabrum that at night blazes with light (see photograph).  Above the columns are large busts of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Ludwig van Beethoven on the main fa\u00e7ade and Richard Wagner on the side.  The top of the main fa\u00e7ade is graced by a large allegoric mosaic by Llu\u00eds Bru that represents the members of the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0, but it is impossible to see it clearly from the narrow street below.\n\n\n=== Entrance ===\nOriginally, guests entered the Palau from the street through two arches supported by thick pillars that opened into the vestibule. The former ticket windows, which are located in the center pillar, are beautiful concentric arches adorned with floral mosaics of various materials created by Llu\u00eds Bru.\n\n\n=== Vestibule, staircases, and foyer ===\nThe ceiling of the vestibule is decorated with glazed ceramic moldings that are arranged in the shape of stars.  From the vestibule, on the left and right, grand marble staircases ascend from between crowned lamps on columns to bring visitors to the second floor.  The balustrades of the staircases, also marble, are supported by unusual transparent yellow glass balusters.  The underside of the staircases is covered with tiles that form gleaming canopies on either side of the vestibule.\nToday, guests generally enter the Palau through the foyer, which was created in the renovations of Tusquets and D\u00edaz from what originally were the headquarters of the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0.  The large space of the foyer is more soberly decorated than the rest of the Palau, but the wide exposed brick arches with their marvelous glazed green, pink, and yellow ceramic flowers recapitulate the ornamentation of the rest of building.  The foyer features a large counter where tapas and beverages can be served to concert-goers or visitors who are touring the building.  The bar is situated between massive pillars of brick and is illuminated from behind by expansive stained-glass panes that are suspended above it.  A glass case in the foyer displays the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0's banner, which bears its crest embroidered on fabric in the modernisme style.\n\n\n=== Llu\u00eds Millet hall ===\nThe Llu\u00eds Millet hall is a salon located on the second floor of the Palau that is named after one of the founders of the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0.  The hall is a popular gathering place for concert-goers and also serves as a teaching area for visitors touring the building.  From floor to ceiling the hall is two stories high and affords views of the intricate mosaics on the two rows of columns outside its windows that are much better than those available from the street.\nIt is ornated by several bronze busts of musicians related to the Palau: Llu\u00eds Millet and Amadeu Vives (Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0 founders), Pablo Casals, Eduard Toldr\u00e0 (founder and first conductor of the Orquestra Municipal de Barcelona), Just Cabot (Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0 president) and pianist Rosa Sabater.\n\n\n=== Concert hall ===\n\nThe concert hall is one of the most beautiful in the world (...) without exaggeration.  It is one of its most important architectural treasures.  Its pace, simple, complex, mystical and paradoxical, defies accurate description.-David Mackay\n(Quoted in Carandell et al. 2006, 62)\nThe concert hall of the Palau, which seats about 2,200 people, is the only auditorium in Europe that is illuminated during daylight hours entirely by natural light.  The walls on two sides consist primarily of stained-glass panes set in magnificent arches, and overhead is an enormous skylight of stained glass designed by Antoni Rigalt whose centerpiece is an inverted dome in shades of gold surrounded by blue that suggests the sun and the sky.\nThe architectural decoration in the concert hall is a masterpiece of creativity and imagination, yet everything has been carefully considered for its utility in the presentation of music.  The hall is not a theater, because the massive sculptures flanking the stage make the use of scenery nearly impossible.  Likewise, even though a noble pipe organ graces the apse-like area above and behind the stage, the hall is not a church.\n\nThe dominant theme in the sumptuous sculptural decor of the concert hall is choral music, something that might be expected in an auditorium commissioned by a choral society.  A choir of young women surrounds the \"sun\" in the stained-glass skylight, and a bust of Anselm Clav\u00e9, a famous choir director who was instrumental in reviving Catalan folk songs, is situated on the left side of the stage, under a stone tree.  Seated beneath this statue are sculpted girls singing the Catalan song Les Flors de Maig (The Flowers of May).\nThe whole arch over the front of the stage was sculpted by D\u00eddac Masana and Pablo Gargallo.  On the right side is depicted the ride of the valkyries in Wagner's opera Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyries), an opera in which the female choir sings with great musical power.  Under the valkyries and among two Doric columns\u2014symbol of classical art\u2014is a bust of Beethoven that many think was placed there in honor of the beautiful choral composition in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony known as the Ode to Joy. So, the arch represents folk music on the left and classical music on the right, both united at the top of the arch.\n\nIn a semicircle on the sides of the back of the stage are the figures of 18 young women popularly known as the muses (although there are only nine muses in Greek mythology).\n</ref> The upper bodies were sculpted by Eusebi Arnau and the mosaic work of their lower bodies was created by Llu\u00eds Bru.  The monotone upper bodies of the women protrude from the wall and their lower bodies are depicted by colorful mosaics that form part of the wall.  Each of the women is playing a different musical instrument, and each is wearing a different skirt, blouse, and headdress of elaborate design. In the middle between the two groups is a mosaic of the coat of arms of Catalonia. The muse to the right of the Catalan coat of arms is the only one that depicts on her dress the coat of arms of Austria and double-headed eagle of the Spanish Habsburgs dynasty. In the early days of the Palau, many critics found these figures unsettling or even eerie, but today they are widely regarded as perhaps the best sculptural work in the concert hall.\nThe sculptures of winged horses that enjoy a commanding position in the upper balcony are said to honor Pegasus, the horse of Greek mythology that is the symbol of high-flying imagination.  Pegasus was ridden by the muses when called by their father Zeus to be by his side on Mount Olympus.\nIn each of the vaults between the pillars and the glass walls, there is a white tile medallion, bordered with laurel green leaves, with the name of a great musician. To the left of the stage, starting from it: Palestrina, J.S. Bach, Carissimi, Beethoven and Chopin; to the right: Victoria, Handel, Mozart, Gluck and Wagner. On the wall between the ceilings of the main room and that of the back of the second floor of the same room, there are four more ceramic medallions, which synthesize the history of Catalan music: Brudieu, Flexta, Viola, Terradellas and Clav\u00e9.\n\n\n== Remodeling and extension ==\nBetween 1982 and 1989 parts of the building were restored to their original state, technically upgraded and expanded to allow additional uses. The new work did not compromise the decorative or structural integrity of the original building.  Stone, brick, iron, glass, and ceramics were used in the same way that Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner used them.  One of the most important expansions is the adjoining building of six stories that houses dressing rooms, a library, and an archive.\nFrom 2006 to 2008 some further restoration was carried out: the lantern on the top of the tower on the corner of the building was reinstalled, as were some ornamental features of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\n=== Petit Palau ===\n\nOpened in 2004, the Petit Palau is 11 metres below the square that was created in the work of 1982-1989 between the Palau and the neighbouring church.  It has a seating capacity of 538 people and is equipped with variable acoustics for different types of music and spoken word.  It also possesses the latest in audiovisual technology.  Like the other additions, it was designed in the spirit of Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner.  It is light and transparent like the Palau proper, but at the same time it is modern in its great flexibility for different cultural, social, and business uses.\n\n\n=== Appearances in film ===\nOn 7 September 2018, the Palau de la M\u00fasica appeared in BBC TV's Release Date trailer for Season 11 of Doctor Who. The trailer shows Jodie Whittaker, as the first female Doctor, literally 'shattering the glass ceiling' of the Palau's striking skylight.\n\n\n== Artistic history ==\nFrom the opening of the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in 1908 special attention was given to the promotion of local composers and artists. After World War I the Orquestra Pau Casals performed at the Palau, and among composers featured gave presentations of the music of Enrique Granados from 1921 onwards.Many of the world's best soloists and singers have visited the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana, among them: Andr\u00e9s Segovia, Lela Tsurtsumia, Pablo Casals, Jacques Thibaud, Alfred Cortot, Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe, Albert Schweitzer, Enric Granados, Blanche Selva, Wilhelm Backhaus, Emil Sauer, Wanda Landowska, Clara Haskil, Fritz Kreisler, Manuel Quiroga, Arthur Rubinstein, Claudio Arrau, Yehudi Menuhin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Julian Lloyd Webber, Alicia de Larrocha, Vict\u00f2ria dels \u00c0ngels, Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Josep Carreras, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Barbara Hendricks, Alfred Brendel, Wilhelm Kempff, Sviatoslav Richter, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Maurizio Pollini, Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Jessye Norman, and Daniel Barenboim.\n\nMany great orchestras and conductors have played at the auditorium, including the Berliner Philharmoniker with Richard Strauss, Herbert von Karajan, Claudio Abbado and Mariss Jansons; the Wiener Philharmoniker, with Carl Schuricht, Karl B\u00f6hm, Zubin Mehta and Leonard Bernstein; the Amsterdam Concertgebouw with Eugen Jochum, Antal Dor\u00e1ti and Mariss Jansons;the Israel Philharmonic with Zubin Mehta; the Staatskapelle Berlin; the Chicago Symphony with Daniel Barenboim, the New York Philharmonic with Kurt Masur; the M\u00fcnchner Philharmoniker with Sergiu Celibidache; the Cleveland Orchestra with Lorin Maazel; the Philharmonia Orchestra with Carlo Maria Giulini; and Concentus Musicus Wien with Nikolaus Harnoncourt, V\u00e1clav Neumann, Jordi Savall, and Philippe Herreweghe.\n\nAlso performing at the Palau have been choirs, such as Capella Sistina di Roma, Orfe\u00f3n Donostiarra, Escolania de Montserrat, and the Wiener S\u00e4ngerknaben.  From 1920 to 1936, the Orquestra Pau Casals was resident under the direction of Pablo Casals (sometimes known by his Catalan name, Pau Casals), Richard Strauss, Vincent d'Indy, Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Anton Webern, Arthur Honegger, Manuel de Falla, and Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe, among others. For years, the resident orchestra at the Palau has been the Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona.\nImportant composers have performed or conducted their own works, including Enric Granados, Richard Strauss, Maurice Ravel, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Manuel de Falla, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Sergei Rachmaninov, Anton Webern, Roberto Gerhard, Georges Enescu, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, Arthur Honegger, Frederic Mompou, Krzysztof Penderecki, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, and Pierre Boulez.\nOther artists, actors, dancers, jazz soloists, popular singers, and bands have performed at the Palau: Lela Tsurtsumia, Vittorio Gassman, Maurice B\u00e9jart, \u00c1ngel Corella, Charles Aznavour, Duke Ellington, Tete Montoliu, Oscar Peterson, Woody Allen, Keith Jarrett, Ella Fitzgerald, Michel Camilo, Tamara Rojo, Paco de Luc\u00eda or Bebo Vald\u00e9s, Jorge Drexler, Cassandra Wilson, Vicente Amigo, Anoushka Shankar, Norah Jones and Juanes.\nThe Palau became an emblematic theater for Catalan singers of the Nova Can\u00e7\u00f3 (New Song, or Catalan popular song from the 1960s). Singing at the Palau was a kind of consecration for a singer. For example, Raimon, Joan Manuel Serrat, Maria del Mar Bonet, and Llu\u00eds Llach have sung there.\nFor some years, plays were performed there. Companies such as the Teatre Experimental Catal\u00e0, Companyia Adri\u00e0 Gual or Agrupaci\u00f3 Dram\u00e0tica de Barcelona (1955\u20131963) performed their shows at the Palau.\n\n\n=== Premi\u00e8res performed ===\nAs the main concert hall in the city, the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana has staged many world premi\u00e8res of musical compositions, including the following (the most relevant for music history are in bold type):\n\n1908 Enric Granados' symphonic poem Dante.\n1911 Enric Granados' first book of his piano suite Goyescas and his Allegro de concierto and Cant de les estrelles (Song of the stars), for chorus and orchestra; Isaac Alb\u00e9niz's Azulejos, prelude for piano finished by Enric Granados.\n1914 Enric Granados' Tonadillas, song cycle for voice and piano.\n1921 Eduard Toldr\u00e0's string quartett Vistes al mar (Sight to the sea) (31 May).\n1923 Joaqu\u00edn Turina's Tres arias for soprano and piano.\n1925 Manuel de Falla's Psych\u00e9, and Frederic Mompou's Charmes, n\u00fam. 4-6.\n1926 Jaume Pahissa's Suite intertonal (October 26); Joaqu\u00edn Turina's Dos canciones (October 29) for soprano and piano; Manuel de Falla's Harpsichord Concerto (November 5).\n1928 Eduard Toldr\u00e0's opera El giravolt de maig (The May sunflower); Frederic Mompou's Comptines, three songs for voice and piano; Joaqu\u00edn Turina's Ritmos: fantasia coreogr\u00e1fica for orchestra (Rhythms: a choreographic fantasy) (October 23), and Evocaciones for piano (October 29).\n1929 Roberto Gerhard's Concertino for strings, Wind quintet, and other of the author's early works.\n1932 Manuel Blancafort's El rapte de les sabines (The Sabine women abduction) (other Blancafort's works were premiered here after: Ermita i panorama (Hermit and panorame) (1946), Concert omaggio a Franz Liszt (1944), Concert ib\u00e8ric (Iberian concerto) (1950), Simfonia en mi (1951), Cantata Verge Maria (Virgin Mary cantata) (1968), Raps\u00f2dia catalana (Catalan rhapsody) (1972), etc.)\n1936 Alban Berg's Violin concerto (April 19); Roberto Gerhard's suite from the ballet Ariel.\n1938 Roberto Gerhard's Albada, interludi i dansa (Sunrise, interlude and dance) (May 14)\n1940 Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo's  Concierto de Aranjuez (November 9).\n1945 Xavier Montsalvatge's Cinco canciones negras (only the four first songs; the first performance of the five songs was given a few months after at the Ateneu Barcelon\u00e8s); many other of the Montsalvatge's works have had their premieres at the Palau.\n1946 Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo's Quatre can\u00e7ons en llengua catalana (Four songs in Catalan language). and Tr\u00edptic de Moss\u00e8n Cinto (Jacint Verdaguer's triptych), both song cycles for soprano and orchestra.\n1948 Xavier Montsalvatge's Simfonia mediterr\u00e0nia (Mediterranean Symphony).\n1952 Frederic Mompou's Cantar del alma, choral version.\n1954 Salvador Bacarisse's 3rd Piano Concerto.\n1957 Salvador Espriu's play Primera hist\u00f2ria d'Esther.\n1959 Joaqu\u00edn Nin-Culmell's ballet Don Juan.\n1960 Xavier Montsalvatge's C\u00e0ntic espiritual.\n1961 Frederic Mompou's Variacions sobre un tema de Chopin for orchestra; Joan Brossa's play Or i sal.\n1963 Xavier Montsalvatge's Desintegraci\u00f3 morfol\u00f2gica de la xacona de J.

          "We went twice. 1st for a concert to experience music in this beautiful setting. 2nd time for a tour. Both were well worth it but if I could pick only one, I'd pick the concert. If you do go to a concert, make sure you pick the main concert hall as there is a small venue in the",

          "First, before anything, be SURE you have selected a tour timeslot that will be presented in YOUR language. I simply selected a timeslot but found out later it would be presented in Spanish. I could've selected an English slot for 30 minutes later but I didn't notice what",

          "This concert hall was built over 100 years ago and was well ahead of its time! The use of natural light was awe inspiring. The workmanship was immaculate and the acoustics were fantastic. It is not a large concert hall and thus it is able to highlight all types of music. The 1",

          "We went to see this magnificent building built by the famous architects of the city (after Gaudi), Domenech and Montaner, during the day and then attended a wonderful new year concert in the evening. The interior was even more fascinating and interesting than the outside. You",

          "We attended the Gran Gala Flamenco performance and the theater was fully booked on the ground and first floors. Finding seats only on the second floor, the view was not optimal, but the performance was magnificent. We would recommend it to almost anyone. The show lasts a little",
          "We bought the standard guided tour in English from the Palau website. Our guide Andres was funny, engaging and open to questions. The tour included a brief organ performance, which was grand and made the auditorium come to life! I inquired about upgrading to add a 20 minute",
          "The tour was difficult to hear at times and perhaps could have been of slightly more substance but just having the chance to be inside this stunning, light filled space was worth every cent. Buy tickets online so as not to be disappointed as purchase on the day may not be",

          "We popped in to the Palau de la Musica during a recent visit and were blown away by the whole experience. Make sure you join one of the tours offered in the venue, as it shows you exactly how the building was constructed, as well as giving you an insight into the designs behind",
          "Was lucky enough to go see the Barcelona guitar trio and dance between Christmas and New Year. What a magical experience, the venue is just fantastic, not being to big, means you can see brilliantly, not like some venues. The performances were just magical and really made our",
          "The building is stunning inside and out, the only way to visit is with a tour or watch a performance, the tour takes approximately 1 hour and starts with a short video. Towards the end you get to listen the magnificent organ. It was cheaper to pre book your tickets online.",

          "We have had a fabulous time in may tours of Barcelona this week but the tour of the Palace was beyond disappointing. Let me count the ways. Because of the size of the group we were split into 2 groups with two guides who wound up talking over each other so you could not hear",
          "Place is nice and beautiful but it was very small tour and ticket price 20 euro doesn't justify specially when this has other income from concert as well, visiting saint pau for 20 euro I feel more worth",
          "This was an impressive building, both inside and out. We were lucky to be there when a children's choir was rehearsing and could witness the great acoustics. You can only see the building via a tour. There are limited tours in English, so you may need to book ahead of time.",
          "This palace was designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, one of Gaudi's professors! We went in late Sept. and just walked up and bought tickets. No lines!

          "The modernist structure of the Palau is interesting but \"over the top\" decorated. Colorful, but too saturated with ornamentation for my taste. However, the acoustics of the concert hall were quite good and it was a great venue to see Bizet's Carmen opera. It is worth going to",

          "It's one of those places worth to visit if you can combine it with a music event/concert as there's quite an interesting offer, and paying the entrance just to visit it it's not worth enough in my opinion.",
          "The hall is quite beautiful and not overly large, so if you are seeing a show there, most of the seats will be good. We got the first row on the top level and were quite happy with the seats. The flamenco show was outstanding too! Just get there early enough...it was slow",

          "This is truly one of the great buildings in the world. The exotic, sensuous ebb and flow of the place stagger the imagination that man could not only dream up such a structure but bring it to reality. Beautifully restored and lovingly cared for this is a \"must see\" in Barcelona.",
          "We came to visit the Palau with friends on their first trip to Barcelona for just 3 days and they are so glad that they did so as the Palau is simply unique and is centrally located. Probably even the fact that it is located in a narrow street and hardly noticeable , although",

          "This is an amazing place. It is most definitely worth visiting. Taking the tour is also well worth it at 16\u20ac for seniors. By taking the tour, you get to learn quite a bit on the history and building of the theater. Most importantly, you get to visit inside which is absolutely",
          "It was kind of expensive but still worth the tour as I think the money goes to fund the private venue and related local artists. I enjoyed hearing the history of place. One thing that struck me as odd was that Herbie Hancock was pointed out as a featured artist over the years.",
          "It was at the end of what was our leisurely walk along the EL BORN neighborhood and we were amazed by this lovely building. We went inside but unfortunately, didn't catch up the last ENGLISH guided tour. Too bad - we would have wanted to see the interiors of the building. I bet",

          "This palace is really worth a visit! Go at 2 in the afternoon, if it\u2019s sunny the light inside is amazing!",
          "We got to hear and see a remarkable concert in this splendid theatre space. The detailing of the architecture, the use of colour, textures and stain glass is incredibly beautiful. We were told the best way to see the theatre was to attend a concert - and we were not",
          "beautiful building terrible production.....the concert hall is fabulous and very ornate and the acoustics are excellent. We didn't have any drinks or food so I cannot comment of them, but sadly the production of Carmen was awful. A with rate production which felt very amateur.",
          "Is one of the Jewels of Catalan Belle Epoque Architecture, it is worth a visit, even if you are not attending a concert.",
          "I had the opportunity to drink a coffee in inside this music palace and to visit it. It is a truly great building that you cannot miss! The design is a mix of modern and classic styles, full of colors, with a very good service level for tourists.",
          "We had a choice to take the tour or see a how in the evening. I had some the latter about five years ago and the show was good. This time, we saw three classical guitarists accompanied by a couple of flamenco dancers and totally enjoyed ourselves. We purchased the least",
          "We went for a concert, which was wonderful- but fell in love with the architecture and the history in this place! It is worth the visit regardless, however, if you have time to take in a show do it! you wont be disappointed!",
          "We had a guided tour in french and were only 5 people so almost a private visit. after a 10 minutes firlm about the history of the Palau we went through the building from the balcony to the front of the stage and then to the second floor. The building is just amazing and if i",
          "One of our favorite places in the world. We have attended concerts on multiple trips to Barcelona. This music venue offers behind the scenes historical tours. It is not a Gaudi creation, but nevertheless influenced by him. The stained glass in the roof is absolutely",
          "Amazing place full of lights, colours and symbolism. Definitely worth a visit when in Barcelona, one of my favorite attractions in Barcelona. Don't let the 20 EUR admission fee scare you, definitely worth the money, this place is unique.",
          "We enjoyed a piano caocert and loved the building overall. Take the guilded tour to really appreciate this palace.",
          "The exterior is a work of art and definitely on your list of places to see. But you really must see the inside as well and the way to do that is to attend an event here. Fabulous design, unique in the world.",
          "We went here twice while in Barcelona, once for the Flaminco dancing the other for the opera. Don't think I've ever been in a theater quite like this. It's really something to see! The shows were great too!",
          "We attended an evening Flamenco show in the Palau and thoroughly enjoyed both the location and the experience. We'd previously passed by the outside during the day time and enjoyed taking pictures and appreciating the detailed exterior. The interior was even more beautiful,",
          "Words cannot describe how amazing and special this concert hall is. It was designed by one of Gaudi's contemporaries, who was extremely talented. The stained glass is incredible and the acoustics are amazing. It is a must see when visiting Barcelona!",
          "We went to a Flamenco Guitar & Dance performance, which was superb. Such a lovely building, with a nice bar/cafe too.",
          "Amazing place and seeing a concert really shows you what the building can do. Worth it to be close the ceilings and decorations.",

          "Our last night in Barcelona, before the cruise, we went to a concert at the Palau de la Musica. Next year will be the 250th birthday of Beethoven and everybody is getting into celebrating. This concert was a joint effort of the Symphony Orchestra of the Valleys and the Youth",
          "Despite warnings of protest, police precedence, we powered through to a packed house and enjoyed a most amazing cultural event. A cross between gypsy kings and classical opera set to powerful dance is how I would describe this not to be missed cultural experience. All six",
          "Wildly beautiful and delightful exterior and interior. We enjoyed a lovely concert there in this unique setting.",
          "The Palau de M\u00fasica is a must when in Barcelona. The pictures do not do justice and seeing the outside of the building does not even come close to the beauty of the inside! Don\u2019t hesitate, go! :-)",
          "This building is well worth a trip to see it. We did a tour and early evening concert with two young musicians, not a full on concert. It was the perfect mix of tour and music. The stained glass in the concert hall is beautiful as are the columns on the upper terrace. Once",
          "We were staying close by and happened to walk by this building. The location is quite interesting. It\u2019s amongst a bunch of small stores. We didn\u2019t get to go inside. It was closed when we were there.",
          "Herbie Hancock at the Barcelona Jazz Festival!! Full house \u2026 such a beautiful and intimate venue for musicians and fans!",
          "We read about this beautiful theater, and while they offer tours of just the building, we opted to see a performance there. The place has gorgeous artwork, carvings, stained glass, just beautiful. The flamenco show featured four dancers, two singers an musicians. It was our",
          "What a wonderful Catalan modernist architecture. Located in Sant Pere. Super emblematic build! It\u2019s a must!",
          "If you\u2019re in Barcelona, reserve a ticket and set aside a little over an hour to see this monument to design and music. The style and colors are fantastic. The tour is informative and includes a short organ performance on the recently rebuilt organ that digitally records live",
          "As a professional choral Director, I was very excited to visit the Palau. I was NOT disappointed. Our guide, James Andrew, was well-informed and made it a wonderful experience. He gave us all of the pertinent details without being boring. The stories he told were",
          "Designed in the Catalan modernist style by Luis Domenech i Montaner in 1905-08. Beautiful exterior. I can only imagine how it looks like inside. We happened to be meeting here for our tour group. I would have loved to see a performance here.",
          "We were able to go inside & take photos & no charge to go in. We were amazed at this beautiful building & all the artwork. It\u2019s really worth it to check it out. You could not go upstairs but what you are allowed is really worth it.",
          "We dildnt take the tour, instead we bought tickets to a guitar concert. We were blown away by the acoustics and we were sitting on the side. The music palace is worth the visit, it\u2019s just a beautiful example of modernism/ art nouveau. Take a tour ( get tickets in advance) or",
          "The Palau de la Musica is a beautiful venue and well worth visiting, just not on this tour. We waited ten minutes past start time in the wrong area along with a dozen others yet not one of the staff members said a word to us. When we were admitted, we were sent to watch a movie",
          "We took the tour as the show times were not convenient for us. Still was worth the price. We did have a demonstration of the pipe organ which was very nice. There was something to be seen every where you looked.",
          "Make time to visit, beautiful construction, magnificent interior. We were lucky to listen to an amazing chorus that was recording a show for European television.",
          "You have to take a walk inside the building and check out this place. There is a small bar that sells food on the one end of it. The exterior is also something wonderful to see !",
          "Make sure you book a ticket for a musical performance at this work of art! One of the wonders of the world!",
          "We accidentally discovered this on a wander to the gotic area. Took the tour in the afternoon when everything was glistening. Heard choirs practicing for a competition and we were amazed but the acoustics. What a magical place.",
          "The building is beautiful and the stained glass ceiling alone is worth the price of admission, but the tour we went on was a little dry. My recomendation is to go to a show there and admire the architecture and beatiful ceiling while you enjoy the show. In either case, you",
          "We had a great guide, Marco. The Palau is very beautiful and the best part was that there was a choir practicing while we were there. They sang incredible harmonies a cappella.",
          "Failing to get into La Sagrada Familia again, we opted instead to check out this wonderful gem of a building instead. We took the guided tour which included a short film about the origins of the Music Palace and the Orfeo Catalan choir. Fascinating to see old footage of",
          "Great theatre inside and out, well worth attending a concert here. PRO TIP: they don't open the doors until the time listed on ticket, but come 30mins - an hour early in order to take some nice pictures in the lobby",
          "We didn't get to attend a concert but did get tickets for the English tour. Introductory film is great with all the old photos. This is a wonder of a place.",
          "The dancing is incredible! I was stunned at the beauty of it - paraticularly the female roll, the shawl dance... she WAS the music! spectacular!",
          "The main chamber is impressive. The design is very elegant and focus on acoustics . When we were there a youth group was practicing for a competition that evening. Suggest check the schedule to buy tickets for a concert. They were sold out when we tried.",
          "The architecture of this building is spectacular. The tour is lovely. but what makes this tour special is being able to experience a performance after the tour. When you book your tour be sure to see if your tour includes a performance afterwards. Well worth your time.",
          "In the Palau de la Musica Catalana and nearby streets/alleys, there are many options for wonderful entertainment, eateries, and tours.",
          "We wanted to visit the music palace but were short on time. Decided last minute to see if there were any tickets available and we lucked out. Young talents concert - very talented and professional pianists and one violinist! I have to say that I have not seen anything like this.",
          "This music hall was started and is still owned by a private choir. Take the 60-minute tour to learn how it got started, see the truly amazing decoration, and hear a bit of the incredible organ. A must-see.",
          "hopefully you'll have time to visit this impressive Palau de la Musica; we were just in time for a guided one hour tour & it was really nice just to look at all the work of art everywhere is interesting a Must see if you like architecture & stunning art & colors wish we'll go",
          "This is a DO NOT MISS site! The group tour in English was educational and well done. The building was marvelous, Beautiful, intricate and unforgettable. Wish I could have seen a production but alas there wasn\u2019t something in the main theater.",
          "We saw classical guitarists with flamenco dancers on October 14, 2019. The show was wonderful and the venue beautiful.",
          "The building was designed by architect, Llu\u00eds Domenech i Montaner and built between 1905 and 1908. The Palau de la Musica is a very unique building. The narrow streets of the neighbourhood of Ciutat Vella make it difficult to fully appreciate the main facade of the Palau . The",
          "Mother daughter tourist day with 4 of us. We booked the English speaking tour and were delighted with our guide and the explanations. Plus it was cool indoors. And we were in a fun shopping area. All in all worth the time and ticket price.",
          "We took an afternoon tour in English. Many people lined up and we were a bit unhappy initially as we prefer small numbers for tours. The Palau de la Musica is so large and so beautiful, you forget others are there with you. Soak it in and enjoy it.",
          "As everything in Barcelona, Palau Musica catalana is a piece of art. Didn't enjoy the flame go concert that much. It was rather boring. It was definitely expensive(35\u20ac per person for 1 and a half hour)! The building is remarkably beautiful.",
          "We booked tickets for a guitar concert without knowing how spectacular the the building and theater is. It is a world class concert hall, devoted to instrumental and choral music.",
          "This is one of the best attractions in the City. Tickets need to be booked in advance if possible in the summer, but other times are simply available on demand. Helpful if one speaks several languages since the tours are by language. The building is very colourful and intricate",
          "We took a brief tour followed by a piano performance in the large auditorium. The guide was a bit distracted due to a \"thief\" on the premises, but it is not to be missed for the beautiful architecture, design, acoustics, etc.",
          "I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before. Amazing. Beautiful. Stunning. The colourful glass and painted ceramics everywhere are just magical. I bought tickets right there and unfortunately the English tours were sold out for the day so I went for the Spanish one",
          "We went to see a Flaminco show at the Palau de la Musica. the sound and the architecture are unbelievable. The show itself not so good.",
          "Went upon the recommendation of Susi to listen to Pedro Gonsalves Flamenco guitar performance and also his quartet. The place is grand, undescribably beautiful and well maintained. The seats are narrow and the space to negotiate is a bit difficult if there are people sitting but",
          "We took the tour of the Palau and were very impressed. Its another architectual gem of the city. If you can, see if you can get a ticket with a musical performer at the end. We were not able to, but just hearing a recording play in the auditorium was really amazing.",
          "A\u021bi dorit s\u0103 scrie\u021bi: Trebuie sa vedeti acest palat. Este o cladire foarte interesanta. Are o acustica incredibila. Sa va duceti si la un spectacol de muzica in aceasta sala. 151/5000 You must see this palace. It is a very interesting building. It has incredible acoustics. Also",

          "Apart from the history of the place and the magnificence of the building itself the Palau locks you into a state of admiratipn for the architect who had the vision to conjure this building. Our guide on the day was very good in explaining the details in this place.",
          "The guiding tour was very informative, giving you the history of the theater. The building is impressive and the sound inside the theater was beautiful. We experienced a piano solo in the theater and it was absolutely beautiful.",
          "The tour takes around an hour, cost between \u00a315 & \u00a320. We arrived 5 mins before a tour was going to start, paid and went straight in. No sign of queues. Very enjoyable, great architecture with concerts in mind. Well worth a visit. We'll take in a concert next time, all",
          "What a treat it was to visit this amazing theatre. I saw photos in a travel book and couldn't resist booking to see a show. We saw a guitar trio with Flamenco dancers who were fantastic. The building itself is magical, I don't think I have ever seen anything quite like it",
          "If you want to enjoy classical or modern music in a unique atmosphere book a concert at Palau de la Musica. I am a big fan of their piano concerts, always with top performers. The concert hall is gorgeous, as is the whole building.",
          "The Musica de la Palau takes your breath away when you first see it, Inside and out it is a magnificent building. The Theatre is lovely in its design and acoustics. Horses galloping out the walls that sour to the ceiling. Stained glass as the centerpiece of the ceiling. It",
          "When you find yourself in Barcelona make it a point to attend a performance at the Palau de la Musica Catalana. The venue itself is worth the price of admission and the shows are fabulous!",
          "We assisted to a show with three outstanding guitarists and a couple of flamenco dancer. The palau is a really beautiful place .",
          "Saw a show of rich flamenco dance and guitar music, utterly enchanting. Tickets are a little expensive but the front rows are absolutely worth it. Had a fantastic time my first night in Barcelona.",
          "There are quite a few beautiful old venues in Barcelona. We just happened to pick this one because they were having a traditional Flamenco concert. I recommend the venue but go for a show versus a tour. Why not get the whole experience? Great views, comfortable seats and a",
          "We saw a flamenco and Spanish guitar show at the Palau. The interior is another beautifully detailed example of the Modernismo style. Great show, beautiful place.",
          "I decided to avoid another tour and just bought tickets to a concert. So glad I did! Walked around the place before the concert. It's very unique and ornamental. Performance was wonderful. Combination of arts (music and architecture) leaves stronger impression and pleasant",
          "My favorite building in Barcelona without a doubt. The building is just unbelievable and the Dominique though of every single detail. It is worth to get a tour guide to learn about the details of the building.",
          "One of the most fabulous modernist buildings Difficult finding words to describe the original walls and stained glass windows Absolutely magnificient",

          "Sat Oct 5 attended to hear Simfonia del Nou Mon Dvorak. I thought why not visit the building and listen to music at the same time. What a good decision! My Husband not a big fan of symphony but he was blown away. Not only is the venue mind blowing but the music itself was",
          "This is a beautiful Opera House with some of the most stunning architecture inside and out. The stained glass ceiling is incredible.",
          "This is an outstanding building. The stained glass is breathtaking. It would be worth a visit without a concert. We were extremely fortunate to see Fuad Ibrahimov conduct Carmina Burana. I have not enjoyed watching a conductor more in the past 30 years. It was a magical",
          "This is a lovely concert hall in the Old part of Barcelona. Take the audioguide. It is helpful. Doesn't compare to Albert Hall or La Scala, but quite nice none the less.",
          "We booked the guided tour in English. The building, of course, is phenomenal, and in the main concert hall we were treated to a short organ piece (by Handel). Unfortunately, our guide was difficult to understand due to her accent and also due to the large size of the group. The",
          "We did the guided tour of the building which took an hour. This included a ten minute film and a two minute recording of the organ. This is unquestionably a fascinating piece of architecture with some jaw dropping features and if you\u2019re a chorister yourself you\u2019ll be moved by",
          "Only visited the exterior and part of the interior while eating. The building is awesome and you just have to keep staring. The interior can be described as over the top and fantastic so will be a full tour next visit. The cafe restaurant is very comfortable inside and outside",
          "Guide was very good. English was excellent. The movie overview at the beginning of the tour helped to make what we saw on the tour more interesting. Highly recommended.",
          "I would say Palau de la Musica is definitely a must-see when you visit Barselona. The architecture is beautiful and there\u2019s a story behind every detail. The whole experience wouldn\u2019t have been as inspiring and fascinating if it weren\u2019t for the amazing tour guide in English, Ms",

          "We took a guided tour in English of La Palau de la Musica Catalana. This is a stunning concert hall, full of beautiful art nouveau decoration. There was an interesting and informative 15 minute video on the history of the building followed by a tour inside the concert hall",
          "We met a guide here for a walk around little-known Barcelona so did not see the whole building, However, even a short time spent examing the facade and interior, around the vestibule and cafe is well worth it. To get the best value from a visit, book a concert",
          "worth to visit, especially flamenco performance! Good to have a guide, because of the interesting history of the building.",
          "What a magical place to come and see. This is a must if you visit Barcelona. You won't see anything like this again \ud83d\ude00",
          "Wonderful building which you can appreciate from the outside and step into the lobby to view the interior. Of course you can pay for a tour to see the main hall, but a much better idea would be to use your euros to watch a concert here",
          "We attended a tremendous concert, which I'll review separately from the venue. Easy to get in, line moved quickly, luxurious without being pretentious. Vastly prefer to attend events here versus touristy restaurants featuring flamenco dancers.",
          "Beautiful building. Reserved online 1 hour ahead when I had an open afternoon. Short tour but worthwhile for its art nouveau architecture.",
          "We passed this beautiful building a number of times while exploring Barcelona, and decided to attend a concert one night \"Maestros de la Guitarra\". The concert was wonderfully, but the concert hall stole the show it is a simply spectacular example of opulent operatic",
          "The building is truly amazing, and the inside vibe is worth the admission alone. Next time, I would skip the tour guide (if it's Veronica), who just rattles off the script, so that only about 65% of the words are understood. She is certainly pleasant enough, but hurried you",
          "A great show, beautiful guitar playing and fabulous dancers. Well worth a visit to this glorious theatre!",
          "At this place, you can pickup tickets at the counter without having to reserve ahead of time. Decent tour with a fluent english speaker to guide us around. About an hour tour.",
          "A better way to experience this UNESCO sight is to get a ticket for a performance, which you can do in advance of arrival in Barcelona. Then arrive a half-hour earlier and you'll have the opportunity to walk around. Less expensive seats but excellent views can be had on the",
          "We kind of stumbled on the Palau by accident, just walking past it en route elsewhere. We decided on a whim to use a guided tour to fill in time before going elsewhere and I'm profoundly glad we did, because the place is simply amazing. The foyer and coffee shop are impressive",
          "You must take a Viator tour to this most unique music venue. No PA system required. the acoustics are insane!....you can hear someone whisper from the stage. The glass in the ceiling and the art throughout the palau is beyond magnificent. Pair this up with a tour of the \"Gothic",
          "This is certainly one of the most interesting attractions in Barcelona. The guided tour is a must: short video, short walk and then a short organ demo in the big auditorium. Far more interesting than the perfunctory Batll\u00f3 and Mil\u00e0.",

          "We had a couple of hours to kill before going to the cruise terminal so we dropped in on a guided tour of this music hall. It was a very pleasant surprise. Our tour guide gave us a nice history of the building. In addition to be acoustically designed, an equivalent amount of",

          "For some reason I came up with the idea that we should go see flamenco dancing when in Spain and googling it seemed like this would be a great venue for it! So even though the price was a little high, compared to other planned activities, me and the girl friend decided to book",
          "It was the most unexpected surprise of the trip. It was the MOST amazing building and that is saying something for Barcelona. The sound and concert was best. I highly recommend the tour!",

          "We had the chance to see a 20 guitar orchestra playing baroque and traditional Spanish music and had a great time. All seats have good sight lines so don't feel compelled to buy the more expensive tickets. The building itself is worth seeing as well.",
          "Seems out of this world. But you must try the flamenco show to enjoy it in all its glory. It is just a completely different passional experience :)",

          "I think Domenech i Montaner was a better architect than gaudi, and this is one of his two tiled masterpieces of Catalan art nouveau. The concert hall is a riot of stained glass, marbled statuary. Oh, the modern corner is because when built they could buy the entire site. Now",
          "Did the guided tour of the palau (available in French, Catalan, Spanish and English) - actually the only way to visit it. The duration of the tour is around 50 minutes and includes the most iconic features the balcony, lower concert room and upper balcony. I took the French",

          "The main concert hall is stunningly gorgeous \u2013 a triumph of Modernista architecture. The rest of the building is also a showcase of the best of Modernista. Of the European style opera houses I've been to (Vienna, Budapest, and Manaus), the Palace of Catalan Music is the most",
          "My brother and I had a lovely tour of this music hall. We had actually purchased our tickets on line and arrived at the attraction an hour early. Because they had spots still available, they were very accommodating and moved our tour time up an hour. Our guide, Andres",

          "Been to Barcelona a few times but not been in here before, it's pretty amazing though well worth a visit. If you don't want to pay to go on the tour though you can just visit the beautiful cafe it's very good, best coffee we had and not expensive.",

          "I was glad to take the tour to see the interior \u2013 but a person would be far, far better off to attend a daytime concert with light streaming through the glass & see the hall that way. Musicians playing a wide range of genres perform. Our tour lasted 50 minutes, but there was",
          "It was worth the flight from the UK to see Mr Glass having had a brief chat in Norwich about 10 years ago. To actually see him outside the venue about an hour before he was due on stage and get a quick photo, made the trip worthwhile. The venue was cool rather like the Estate",
          "When my daughter and I planned our trip to Barcelona, she mentioned wanting me to see the Palau, as an example of a modernisme structure. I thought it would be fun to catch a concert while we were there. We thoroughly enjoyed a Vivaldi concert on strings, which was wonderful,",

          "So beautiful !! The tour guide was nice but the tour itself is a bit boring tho and you can get the same info in booklets and even more in wiki. I'd suggest to spend same amount of money on some concert in the hall so you get some extra experience and time to enjoy the architecture. Its very pretty (and surprisingly small).",

          "I took the guided tour ,which lasts 45 minutes and I think it's not worth the money (20\u20ac). The music hall is really beautiful and unique in its'architectural style , However, I would recommend instead of a tour to book a ticket for a real concert , then you'll enjoy the room and the concert (2in1)",
          "I saw it from outside and decided to force my parents to accompany me to one of the tours - we did not regret it! This concert hall is incredible! It is like stepping into another time.

          "Spectacular. Building has extension in modern contemporary style which you  will see first if approaching from Las Ramblas side.

          "One of the nicest tours I\u2019ve been on.  Super friendly and allow you to really experience the beauty and grandeur of the incredible music hall.  Far better than a concert in the dark limited to one seat, so glad we went.",

          "This ia a very famous concert hall, which is now 110 years old.  It is a UNESCO Heritage site.  It simply MUST be seen-- there is nothing like it anywhere else.  In addition to the breath-taking architecture, it is a very comfortable, \u2026",
          "I'd recommend going to a concert here since it costs you about the same as just paying to do a tour. Small enough venue all of the seats will be great ones. Seems like many locals attend shows here. Book in advance for best price, or you will be waiting in a long line at the ticket booth.",

Great way to spend a night in Barcelona",

I went for a flamenco show, which was good for the ticket price of \u20ac8, however, there were several stage failures, wardrobe, mic and performance.

          "Impressive Opera Hall designed in 1905 by modernist architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner. It was inaugurated February 9, 1908. The design of the Palau is typical of Catalan modernism in that curves predominate over straight lines, dynamic \u2026",

          "It sounds like a great place for a concert or performance. Unfortunately, we went in just for a tour and it wasn't worth it at all...

          "Awsome old theater with lots of old detail and natural lighting thru stained glass.  1 hour guided tour is 20$, a bit expensive perhaps a better value would be just to buy a concert ticket for a show.  Eitherway, very cool place architecturally.",

        "wiki": "Santa Maria del Mar (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8sant\u0259 m\u0259\u02c8\u027ei.\u0259 \u00f0\u0259l \u02c8ma\u027e], \"Saint Mary of the Sea\") is a church in the Ribera district of Barcelona, Spain, built between 1329 and 1383 at the height of Principality of Catalonia's maritime and mercantile preeminence. It is an outstanding example of Catalan Gothic, with a purity and unity of style that is very unusual in large medieval buildings.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first mention of a church of Santa Maria by the Sea dates from 998. The construction of the present building was promoted by the canon Bernat Llull, who was appointed Archdean of Santa Maria in 1324. Construction work started on 25 March 1329, when the foundation stone was laid by king Alfonso IV of Aragon (III of Barcelona), as commemorated by a tablet in Latin and Catalan on the fa\u00e7ade that faces the Fossar de les Moreres. The architects in charge were Berenguer de Montagut (designer of the building) and Ramon Despuig, and during the construction all the guilds of the Ribera quarter were involved. The walls, the side chapels and the fa\u00e7ades were finished by 1350. In 1379 there was a fire that damaged important parts of the works. Finally, on 3 November 1383 the last stone was laid and on 15 August 1384 the church was consecrated.The 1428 Catalonia earthquake caused several casualties and destroyed the rose window in the west end. The new rose window, in the Flamboyant style, was finished by 1459 and one year later the glass was added. Many of its decorative richness, the images and the Baroque altar were destroyed in a fire set by anti-clerical rioters at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The church survived even though it was on fire for 11 days. The chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, adjacent to the apse, was added in the 19th century.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\nFrom the outside, Santa Maria gives an impression of massive severity that belies the interior. It is hemmed in by the narrow streets of the Ribera, making it difficult to obtain an overall impression, except from the Fossar de les Moreres and the Pla\u00e7a de Santa Maria, both of them former burial grounds.  The latter is dominated by the west end of the church with its rose window. Images of Saint Peter and Saint Paul occupy niches on either side of the west door, and the tympanum shows the Saviour flanked by Our Lady and Saint John.\nThe north-west tower was completed in 1496, but its companion was not finished until 1902.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nIn contrast with the exterior, the interior gives an impression of light and spaciousness. It is of the basilica type, with its three aisles forming a single space with no transepts and no architectural boundary between nave and presbytery. The simple ribbed vault is supported on slender octagonal columns, and abundant daylight streams in through the tall clerestorey windows.\n\nThe interior is almost devoid of imagery of the sort to be found in Barcelona's other large Gothic churches, the cathedral and Santa Maria del Pi, after the fire which occurred in 1936 during anticlerical disturbances. Amongst the most notable of the works destroyed at that time was the Baroque retable by Deodat Casanoves and Salvador Gurri.\nSome interesting stained-glass windows have survived from various periods.The spacing of the columns is the widest of any Gothic church in Europe\u2014about forty-three feet apart, center to center.\n\n\n== Proportions ==\nAccording to the art historian Josep Bracons, the basic unit of measurement used in Santa Maria del Mar was the mediaeval foot of 33 centimetres. Measured in this way, the side chapels are 10 feet deep, the width of the side aisles is double this, while the central aisle is four times as wide, that is, 40 feet. The total width of the church is thus 100 medieval feet, which is also equal to the maximum height of the building.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe construction of Santa Maria del Mar is the background for the best-selling novel La catedral del mar (Cathedral of the Sea), by Ildefonso Falcones (2006) which was subsequently adapted into a Netflix series in 2018\nThe Corpus Christi Procession Leaving the Church of Santa Maria del Mar by Ramon Casas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n360\u00b0 virtual immersive panorama of the church of Santa Maria del Mar\nPhotos",

          "The Gothic Quarter should already be on your list of places to visit while in Barcelona, this is right in the center of it and it's beautiful. The doors are open to the public and although some people are there to worship, guests are still able to walk around and take photos.",

          "After reading the Cathedral of the Sea, I had to visit. What a lovely basilica and what a wonderful story behind its construction.",
          "While exploring the area, we came upon the Basilica and spent some time enjoying the architecture. Unfortunately, because it was late and raining, we did not go inside. We'll save that for the next time we are in Barcelona.",
          "Worth a visit if you're in the area. It's peaceful inside the cathedral, and the led glass windows are really beautiful when the sun shines on them.",
          "Friends recommended that I visit this place i never heard of before. I did. I loved it. It's a stunning place. If you're a spiritual person, you'll feel the holiness of this place. If you're not, then you'll marvel at the architecture. I do recommend it.",
          "We visited the Basilica on a Tapas and Wine Walking Tour. Our guide, David, shared that this was a church built by and for the people. It was completed in 1384. The Basilica\u2019s construction is the focus of \u201cThe Cathedral of the Sea\u201d that is now a Netflix series.",

          "I did both del Mar and del Pi's rooftop tours. Both guides were spectacular, two of the best guides in three weeks in Spain. I did them both, back-to-back, two hours apart (wear knee compression sleeves, if you are old. like me). I will say that del Pi has the better overall",
          "Was there a few years ago and didn't want to pay 7 Euros for 'another church.' This year, before noon, it was free and although dark inside, beautiful and unlike other churches I've seen. Very happy to have gone inside.Check out ceilings!",
          "Must see if you visit Barcelona. Right at Gothic quarter this cathedral is superb. Easily accessible with stawler.",

          "Passed through this beautiful church (for free!) on a local tapas tour, and were told about the rooftop tours; came right back the next day to experience them, and so glad we did. Stunning church, and wonderful, interesting tour that led us to its very roof! Amazing views,",

          "We ended our trip to Spain by visiting this lovely Catalan Gothic basilica that was built in the 1300s. The spaciousness of these churches amaze me. A novel was written about the building of this basilica called \"Cathedral of the Sea\" which I look forward to reading.",
          "Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar is a brilliant example of exquisite Gothic architecture I have gone there for Christmas Midnight Mass and it is chilling and beautiful. >..And I am not even Christian. A must visit, both during mass or not.",
          "It was one of our stops while I and my family were in Barcelona. We didn`t want to pay for Sagrada Familia, so we have decided to visit this church instead! It was astonishing inside! Very peaceful, few people only, you can feel the atmosphere of a Spanish catolic church, very",
          "Splendid example of gothic architecture, sadly the queues were too long on a hot day so we didn't visit the interior.",
          "Although this church is known as \"The Cathedral of the Sea\" it is not actually the Cathedral ( that is in another part of the Gothic Quarter and it is there and here where you will find the courtyard with geese as mentioned in other reviews below) There are times when you can",
          "Our first visit to this wonderful church. I believe serenity best describes the atmosphere inside although the garden area is just as peaceful, when the bells are not ringing. The interior of the church is quite amazing but unadorned unlike many other churches. A visit to the",
          "A fantastic history of the Catalan and also one of the main reasons why FC barcelona is the only football club followed here religiously. The story should be heard form the local your guides or people and it's one you will not forget.",
          "Although I am not a believer, in religious terms the incredible inner experience of peace overwhelmed me from the moment I stepped inside. Not all churches and temples could evoke such a feeling.",
          "It is one of the essential places that must be visited if you come to Barcelona, it is a work of art in an unbeatable environment.",
          "Loved it! Worth the money to go inside... beautiful architecture, history, wonderful experience. There are restaurants nearby that are ok, but a little too pricey... although the ice cream places are definitely worth it!",
          "I visited just to see the outside and inside. We did not purchase any tickets to view anything beyond the main sanctuary, but I'd imagine it would have been worth it. The cathedral was absolutely gorgeous and worth a quick stop.",
          "Wonderful experience . mesmerized with the detailing . beautiful and I enjoyed it very much . There is plenty of cafe around .",
          "Beautiful Basilica both inside and out. Situated in the Gothic Quarter. We paid 7 euros to enter the church, this also included the ability to go onto the roof for fabulous views of Barcelona. The Basilica also has a court yard with geese that live there.",
          "So beautiful . Grand. Architecture is so striking yet peaceful and welcoming . This was my personal favorite. It is close to the marina and the beach. There\u2019s a wonderful street right of the church that has great shops and restaurants and more wonderful little streets off of",
          "We saw this during a Historic Tour with a guide. It is truly an amazing piece of art, as well as a rich religious building built by people who would not stop until they had it done.",
          "This church, named after the sea, is near both the Gothic Quarter and the beach area/Barceloneta. We walked through it during a morning stroll around the Gothic Quarter and other neary points. The church is interesting in that its front facade is fairly crowded without a huge",
          "We enjoyed seeing the Basilica as it was so different from the others we did on this trip. Loved walking the Gothic Quarter and was sorry we had so little time. The city was experiencing some trouble and there was pressure to get back to our side of the city.",
          "This is a very beautiful church especially the stained glass windows on the inside. It is located in the Gothic Quarter amid narrow streets. Unfortunately we were not able to climb to the rooftop to see the views since it was closed when we arrived.",

          "This church was constructed with the donations of the laborers who lived in the neighborhood, and it was done with all speed. Many beautiful statues, including a modern one of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, who lived awhile in Barcelona and begged for alms",
          "A fabulous Cathedral in the older gothic area of Barcelona. Splendid inside and out. I also learned that the word Basilica is roman and these are churches above normal catherdrals as they have been granted special privileges by the Pope.",
          "This is a must to see if you are in Barcelona. It is huge! And it has a very nice gift shop. Be sure to go out into the court yard and see the swans.",

          "We were on a day tour with our HA cruise and this was one of our stops, extremely busy and you have to have your knees and shoulders covered to enter however there were people at the entrance handing out scarves and wraps. Well worth a visit especially as part of a tour as you",
          "The place was gutted and burned during the Spanish Civil War and has been rebuilt, but isn't the gorgeous setting the the Sagrada Familia and the cathedral are.",
          "Take time to visit. It is a good example of a very old gothic church. Enjoy Tapas and drinks in the courtyard near the church.",
          "An elegant and solemn church in honor of Santa Maria, protector of seamen and voyagers. Take a brief stop here to appreciate its architecture and atmosphere. One point worth mentioning is her columns, long and elegant, reminding one of the design in Sagrada Familia.",
          "This church is well worth a visit. A surprisingly beautiful interior giving a sense of serenity and peace.",
          "In a town full of beautiful cathedrals, after awhile they can start to blur together, but this one stands out and shouldn't be missed. Inside it is so soaring and so very gothic. You dont need to stay too long, but slow down for a bit, sit in a pew and take it all in. It was",
          "Great tour not one we would have chosen but had been taken while on a private wine and tapas tour, we really enjoyed the history",
          "beautiful Basilica. polite. helpful staff, answer all questions. I came before the service. they could not let me in, but the girl took me to the Basilica and even told me everything",
          "Another great place to stop by and visit. Its size is deceiving from the outside. Its bigger than you think. The stained glass is amazing, the visit to the roof was a nice touch. Some interesting and elaborate works dedicated to the saints here.",
          "While not quite the scale of Duomo di Milano, this church gives you pause and makes you drink in the history of a part of the world I only suspected existed. Truly worht the stop and cheap ticket prices for just an hour of your day.",
          "One of my favorite churches in Barcelona. It is in the Gothic area. The stained glass in the church and chapel is so beautiful and peaceful. You can see the walking passage and narrow street around the church that makes you feel you are walking in history.",
          "It was a bit crowded on a Sunday but worth the visit. Beautiful windows, beautiful architecture. Definitely go and see if you have time, it's free.",
          "we were not able to go inside in the morning they were having a service and we could not wait had to get to our ship",
          "We visited the Cathedral in the afternoon having been at La Sagrada Familia in the morning. Talk about chalk and cheese! The Cathedral is a stunning building and the view from the rooftop has to be seen (there's a lift!) There was a lovely atmosphere inside the building and in",
          "OUr last night in Barcelona, we were lucky enough to stop in after dinner. It was late and getting dark --Magical inside with all the real candles lit. I lit a candle for safe journey home A very simple but spritual place.",
          "Gothic inspired architecture, colossal ceiling height, the place has something special about it the guided tour is really worth it as the guide gives interesting insight.",
          "Getting to the basilica takes you down narrow gothic alleys but they are quite safe, these are roads in the old gothic section. Pay a fee to go inside as it is beautiful and worth seeing.",
          "This basilica was started in 1329. It was built by the fishermen and the workers in the area to celebrate Mary by the sea. The local people helped carry the stones from the shore to build it. Inside it has a very open floor plan with a famous rose stained glass window.",
          "This Church is truly amazing. It's located in the heart of the old city of Barcelona which adds charm to the area. The church is truly Gothic. The Church itself is dark and but the beautiful stained glass windows offers just the right amount of light. There is a second level",
          "I remembered this church from my first visit 8 years before. So pretty inside. No need to pay entrance fee. Just wonder around. Of course you can make a donation.",
          "Very pretty church in the heart of Old Barcelona. Small fee to get in. There are times that are free for those who complain about the nominal fee, which seems to be used to keep up restoration efforts which are ongoing. Check with your hotel or whatever guide book you are",
          "We enjoyed this tour of the beautiful basilica and tower. There was just enough interesting history at the beginning and the view from the rooftop is spectacular. It\u2019s a lot of steps, so would not be a good fit for elderly visitors or anyone with mobility issues.",
          "This Sunday evening we saw this beautiful Gothic church prior to 7:00 mass. The organ recital prior to mass was moving. What a way to end our stay in Barcelona.",
          "This church is free in the morning and evenings. It is easy to find in the Gothic Quarter/ El Born area. Beautiful structure.",
          "This was my favorite cathedral. It isn\u2019t over run with tourist, so you can take in all the details in quiet. The nearby cathedral lets you on the roof, this cathedral has a tall tower to climb.",
          "Wonderful place to get acquainted with ancient architecture. The cathedral inspires calm and confidence.",
          "Worth searching the streets to find this Basilica. Although smaller, it is beautiful, and well worth a visit.",
          "The beautiful colors of the Windows are inflamed by the sunset light. Look around you and feel the light warm your soul",
          "Beautiful Gothic Church in the heart of downtown Barcelona built during the 14th century when Barcelona was a trading town. Nice to walk around inside and admire the stained glassed windows. I went up to the rooftop by elevator and was able to look at the whole city. There",
          "The basilica of Santa Maria del Mar is good example of this type of Catalan Gothic architecture from 14th century .Great building with amazing stained glass windows running around the whole church. Stained windows are really perfect for its gray walls. The inside is stunning",
          "Open to the public and its worth the trip inside. Painting are astonishing and the detail was incredible. easy in easy out.",
          "There was no sign of any guided tour the day we visited and entrance was free, so we passed a quiet few minutes admiring the breath-taking architecture and especially the rose stained glass window.",
          "Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar is located about a 6 minute walk from the bottom of La Ramblas. Carrer de Josep Anselm Clav\u00e9 provides a scenic walk to the Placa and the church. We were there during La Merc\u00e8 a celebration of patron saint of Barcelona so the church was glorious",
          "This is a must visit while in Barcelona - be aware that shoulders and knees must be covered when visiting - the interior is as impressive as the exterior- it is stunning - would highly recommend",
          "According to the guidebook I brought this building is the best example of complete gothic architecture in the city. Compared to the Cathedral, which cost us \u20ac7 to enter and \u20ac4 more for audioguide, I found this building just as interesting to look inside. The best part is that",
          "An impressive church on a mountain with many levels that is situated in a pretty village giving stunning views of Barcelona . What more could you ask for? How about easy access? Wish granted since you can get all the way to the church using a zone 1 metro ticket. What a bargain",
          "Beautiful church in a very walkable part of the city, with lots of places to eat and drink. Maybe because we visited this on the final evening of our 8-days in Barcelona, we thought the church was glorious, but sounds like to get full beauty of the place you need to visit",
          "Peaceful Gothic Church made and supported by the people of Barcelona. Beautiful Rose Window the size as big as the famous ones in Notre Dame in Paris, France. Not crowded and the views from the roof were great! Small fee to do that. Ever looked down a chimney into a church",
          "Barcelona is Gaudi the rest comes second place..the architectural aspects are always facinating but most Basilicas are nearabout the same.",
          "We only stumbled upon this fine church by accident when looking for the cathedral. It would easily pass as a cathedral in any other place. It is a vast church but does not attract the large visitor numbers of the cathedral. Very high roof and quite light and airy.",
          "Beautiful from inside and outside Gothic architecture surrounded by shops and cafe A must visit 100 chars",
          "Readers will get confused. The \"Cathedral\" is the one you have to go through bag check, etc, can climb stairs to the roof, have to deal with lines, has the geese. The Basilica - Santa Maria del Mar - isn't as impressive but is easier to see. No lines, can roam freely. It",
          "A very impressive church. The Basilica is more ornate but definitely worth visiting. The nearby shops are a bit more upscale in this Born district.",
          "The cathedral is totally stunning. We were over awed. It is the most extraordinary place. The stained glass windows alone have such a magic and are so beautiful. All the little statues all around too. The architecture, oh my goodness it was all just extraordinarily stunning and",
          "Great experience, lovely place! We went there with a group of friends and we loved it! Such an interesting history place.",
          "We really wanted to visit the \u201cBasilica de Santa Maria del Mar\u201d after watching the Netflix series \u201cLa Catedral del Mar\u201d. We were fortunate to have the opportunity to attend mass after the beautiful procession of \u201cLa Virgen de la Merced\u201d entering the church!",
          "This cathedral doesn't get the press that the Barcelona Cathedral or La Sagrada Familia do, but it's worth a visit. There aren't as many tourists and getting in isn't such a hassle (no bag checks), so it has a more laid-back atmosphere with plenty of gorgeous sights. The chapels",
          "Smaller and more intimate than the Cathedral or the Sagrada, this lovely medieval church is well worth a visit.",
          "Didn't have anything that took my breath away. Usual Catholic fare which I can take or leave...quite interesting, you have to pay to enter, book online to avoid the queue.",
          "Having visited the Sagrada before we wanted to see something different and avoid the mad queues! The Basilica is a beautiful building and if you have read Cathedral by the Sea you may have preconceptions about its history. We took a tour of the towers and the guide was very",
          "This was a beautiful Cathedral. We also got the lift up to the roof, not a lot to see here but a good view and photo opportunity.",
          "I simply love this church. After reading the history it makes you appreciate the craftsmanship. For me it is a must see!!!",

          "I love Gothic churches, and the thought of attending Mass at a Catalan Gothic church was too tempting a prospect to pass up. We went for \"international\" Mass at 12:00 noon. While most of the Mass was in Catalan, the priest made an effort to speak a few phrases in other",

          "I am not a religious person, but having read the book, and watched the TV series (La Catedral del Mar), I had to visit this place. To begin with, it's not easy to get there. Everybody says \"just ahead\" but it seems endless. The place itself is not the best kept jewel of the",
          "I love this basilica because the local people made it, also I read the book (la catedral Del Mar) so it\u2019s exciting to be here.",
          "Absolutely stunning. Breathtaking and emotional feelings whilst inside. Well worth paying entry fee to view.",
          "Somber Gothic style. The devotion and piety of people in medieval times, to contribute and raise such a structure amazes me. The Church is beautiful and serene with a personality of its own though it is shadowed in location and renown by the Catedral de Barcelona. But to me it",
          "We stopped by to see this beautiful Basilica on our way to the zoo and we loved it, it is quite big and very impressive, I loved the big columns and also the stained glass, very impressive work. The entry is free so definitely one of Barcelona's attractions that should not be",
          "This church is definitely worth a visit. It is beautiful and awe inspiring. It is free to the public, of course and in a great location.",
          "Although this a parish church it has the size and feel of a cathedral. The style is Gothic and because much of the interior was burned in 1936 the original gothic constructions more visible and experiential. The height of the roof inside is quite amazing and the wide spacing of",
          "its roof tops and is impressive in its simplicity. We learnt a lot about its construction and how the workmen, who carried out the stones from afar, were given tribute in various paintings depicting them carrying bags of stones on their backs. Christine V",
          "The church is impressive. The architecture is amazing. Gothic style. Quiet inside. Good to stop for quiet prayer.",
          "A place that shows gothic architecture. Full of different catholic saints inside the basilica. As a catholic I was in awe of the church and as tourist I could appreciate the history the building has. Everyone was respectful inside and it was fully accessible also.",
          "A lovely church without the massive queues - very impressive walk around and very touching - reasonably priced too",
          "It was a great privilege to be able to celebrate mass here. The architecture is amazing and the singing lovely. It is quite distracting the numbers of visitors wandering about and taking photos during the service.",
          "Beautiful church with a great story. No admission to pay. Easy to find if you are on the Hop on Hop off bus tour. Just ask one of the staff on the bus. The bus stops is just a short distance from the El Born district. On the way to the church you can also see the old market,",

          "Living in Barcelona and have to say that for me, this is the most beautiful church in the city. Smaller than the cathedral but most particular. The book La catedral del Mar and the tv show is based on this beatiful church, build by the fishermans on the 14th century.",
          "We havent been inside but from the outside it looks huge and great. The history about it, is the most interesting thing for me",
          "We found the Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar to be just as interesting, if not more so, than the cathedral of Barcelona. The gothic architecture is spectacular, the history of how funds were raised to build the structure so quickly interesting, and the views from the top of the",
          "We liked this smaller cathedral more than the large Barcelona cathedral. Very impressive and more authentic than the large cathedral that has been re-made in many areas. Free on Sunday before 2.",

          "There is no fee for entering and church is beautiful, so do yourself a favor and go by. Give a small donation for the church instead of paying for entrance in some of the other church\u2019s",
          "I'm glad I came here on the recommendation of a local friend who said that this is the more beautiful of the cathedrals. Having also seen the main cathedral, I have to agree. Santa Maria Del Mar is not as ornate as the other one, but to me it is the simpler forms that make it",
          "Very comparable to Sagrada Familia in size and beauty. If you can't get tickets to see Sagrada, this is an excellent 2nd choice if you have limited time in Barcelona. If you have time to see both, even better. Photos online just do not do this place justice, it is a place that",
          "Went yesterday and absolutely loved it! I got the tour with a guide and she was amazing! very dynamic! Would definitely recommend.",
          "This tour was great as we learned about the history of the church, the fire and current restoration work, plus ended with great views and photo ops from the multiple roof tops of the church. One random observation that several in our party noticed was how well the lighting in",
          "This hidden church transports one back to medieval times with it's stunning columns and gorgeous chapels. The dark interior invites one to sit down and enjoy its peace. Then walk around to admire each chapel and view the richly colored stained glass windows. A hidden gem worth",
          "Beautiful! We went to the Basilica during mass. Visitors flow freely in and out of the basilica while service is going on. Everyone was polite and respectful. I thought the service was nice, especially the singing by the parishioners. If you want to learn more about the HISTORY",
          "Despite being in a super touristy area, this church is a bit of calm in the storm. I gasped when I walked in. Totally different, but equally as grand as Sagrada.",
          "A beautiful and moving place to be. As beautiful as it is on the outside it is even more incredible on the inside. Took so many photos, every display inside was so impressive. The history of the venue made you feel privileged to be inside. There was no cost to enter but we",
          "After reading Cathedral by the Sea, by Ildefonso Falcones, this stop was a must and it did not disappoint. This is a sacred site, not just a tourist attraction. In fact, it's good to go when you want to spend some time in contemplation, mornings 9:00-1:00 p.m. or evenings,",
          "I went to Josep Carreras' Christmas concert, the Basilica is a great sounding board for his voice. On the other hand, austerity in construction, together with the beauty of its arches and its height, express in a clear and didactic way why it has come to be called the town's",
          "A visit not to forget. The beautifulness of plain gothic style will evoque you directly to those times.",
          "After reading Idelfonso Falcones novel La Catedral del mar I needed to see it for real a wonderful book and a great city",
          "Another beautiful Basilica. A real tribute to Gothic Architecture. The sculpture of Saint Ignatius is absolutely stunning. Once of my favourites",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral and I encourage a visit but I didn't have to pay to get in. I don't know what the ticket is for, maybe a guided tour to learn about the history. I just walked around and took pictures.",
          "What a great find during a stroll in the gothic quarter. Never knew it was very famous as the Gaudi inspired pieces seem to dominate everything else. However, this is a basilica not to be missed! Absolutely gorgeous!!",
          "Arrived a little bit late and unfortunately it was closed but the exterior was amazing, in my next visit to Barcelona I will make sure to arrive on time and write down a better review.",
          "We were two families from Texas spending 2 weeks on a European vacation, visiting London, Paris and Barcelona European 14 Day trip from Texas. We had spent months planning this trip, to get the best bang for our bucks and see as many sites as possible. We had purchased tickets",
          "To learn about Barcelona and it's history you should take this tour, walking up the stairs you are walking up the different stages of the basilica construction",
          "Who knew that the church was famous. Obviously not us. Having been to sagrida earlier in the day. We nipped in before a tour with a local. And you know what... got as many wows too. See if u can find the figures on the doors which are images of how the locals bought the stone",
          "Must see Basilica de Santa Maria Del Mar. Stunning have never seen anything like this. We took a private tour and would recommend it to anyone.",
          "Beautiful dome and columns, colorful windows. Quiet place with obvious history. A museum is attached",
          "This is a must see!! You need to take the tour to hear about this amazing place. Still in the works.",
          "This beautiful example of Gothic basilica that was entirely built by the people for the people. Of note, after the devastating fire of 1936, the reconstruction was payed in part by the FC Barcelona, hence the presence of the football club colors in one the the stained glass",
          "This 14th century church has simple lines with lots of stone visible and not a lot of gold, which makes it more beautiful to me. The church was built in the 14th century by the people who lived and worked by the port. The Virgin Mary holding a child on the altar is from the",
          "I just managed to nip in here before the Basilica closed for midday Mass. So that was lucky timing. It would have reopened in the afternoon, of course. But if you really want to see the church or spend lots of time examining it, it may pay you to just acquaint yourself with",
          "A truly wonderful place. Worth a visit . Soo peaceful. Very easy to find. Didn't set out to go here. Just happened across it. Glad we did",
          "So dramatic on the inside too, this tour is a MUST! Easy to get to on the subway, tour is very interesting and informative, beautiful detail. Going up in one of the towers is a must, you take an elevator up and walk down a massive spiral staircase that is not scary because",
          "We stumbled upon this on our rainy day in Barcelona. It\u2019s a beautiful structure and the guided tour was informative. The views from the roof were great even in the rain.",
          "Absolutely amazing place to visit. The scale of the altars and the elaborate decorations will just blow you away. Even if its not your thing it would be very hard not to be impressed. There's just something about the ace that will grab you when you walk in from the madness of",
          "While the gothic architecture is not as impressive as the contemporary La Sagrada Familia, the vaulted ceilings and massive stone construction is amazing. Definitely worth a visit to an impressive basilica, which is an easy walk from most hotels.",
          "Nice place. We were so hungry at the point we decided to walk into the Santa Maria del Mar, and I almost feel guilty we did not spend more time, but it was worth it, and I find myself looking back at the photos we took. Nice visually appealing interior.",
          "In contrast to Sagrada Familia, this large church in the Gothic quarter is simple and unadorned, but very impressive in its size and height. It has a quiet atmosphere and a feeling of tranquility. The main supporting pillars blend into the roof structures and must have been an",
          "This church is very impressive for the relation of height and width. It's beautiful but spare. Nonetheless, unless you are studying Gothic architecture, less than an hour will suffice.",
          "This is the iconic Cathedral from the book La Catedral del Mar. A classic gothic style church located in the Barri del Born. Much more interesting on the inside than the outside. A huge place full of peace and tranquility.",
          "Outstanding example of Catalan Gothic. The interior is cold yet beautiful. I did not get a chance to go, but the tower tours are said to provide some of the best views in Barcelona.",
          "You can pass by this church many times while wandering in the Born....but do make the time to stop in as a part of your wanderings... Santa Maria del Mar is unremarkable from the outside, but there's a commanding presence inside. Like most very old sanctuaries, you can feel the",
          "It was built between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries of the Catalan Gothic style, paid for by the adjacent neighbors of the port and the Ribera. Magnificent interior and austere, it is worth the visit. In the novel Cathedral of the Sea, the action takes place in 14th",
          "Even though this church was just around the corner from where we were staying, we did not enter it (free) until the end of our Barcelona visit. This church is a great example of a Catalan Gothic church in the Ribera (El Born area) district of Barcelona. It was built between",
          "This is the iconic Cathedral from the book La Catedral del Mar. A beautiful church located in the Barri del Born.",
          "WOW is the word that comes to mind when you walk into this Basilica. I got the electrical tour guide to help with the tour of the majestic place.",
          "I really liked this Cathedral and I have been to many. It was build or paid for by fishermen. It felt intimate to me.",
          "We loved the Basilica and thought the tour was wonderful, filled with really interesting information. A highlight of many in Barcelona but I would encourage you to visit. In a great area with so many choices for tapas after the tour. I would definitely take the roof top",
          "Went for mass. Very welcoming. Beautiful basilica. Much history. Look for statue of Ignatius of Loyola.",
          "We were able to walk through this beautiful church for free on Sunday in between masses. This made the experience even more meaningful as we reverently took in the austere structure with other worshippers. Basilica de Santa Maria Del Mar is a great example of Gothic",
          "We toured this basilica on the same day we saw the Cathedral and Sagrada Familia. I enjoyed the contrasts and felt a warmth and comfort here not present at the other, more elaborate buildings.",
          "This is a classic gothic style church. Much more interesting on the inside than the outside. Very beautiful high Gothic ceilings. Great views from the top. Well worth a visit. It is tucked tightly into the Gothic Quarter!",
          "Being from bcn and did not visit the cathedral of the sea since was a kid, and Until now did not realized of this beauty of Art the style the high arcs and immensity of the roof magnificent !!!! For sure one of the jewels of Our city bcn",
          "The windows of this church are spectacular. Its Gothic features are uplifting and it\u2019s an oasis in a busy area of the old city.",
          "Santa Maria Del Mar was completed in 80 years in all Gothic style. A lot of churches take many hundreds of years and the design whims change intent if not entire final look. This church is pure Gothic and a gem to be sure.",
          "My wife and I were very interested in seeing this after watching the Netflix mini series titled Cathedral by the sea. The Basilica is free and definitely worth a visit.",
          "great place to appreciate gothic architecture and see the whole of Barcelona too worth seeing amongst many others",
          "Pretty positive experience. The church is very interesting. Visiting top of the church let you have an amazing view of Barcelona. The guy that guided us trough the visit was very professional, kind and available to answer our questions. Reaching out this church is also a chance",
          "When you enter you are simply left speachles. Huge place full of peace and tranquility. Beautiful painted windows, statues of saints and nice big organs. But what impressed me the most was sitting there listening the holly mass in catalan, not understanding much but feeling",
          "I don't really have much to say about this landmark other then it is a very nice place to visit while in Barcelona. Our family enjoyed visiting this basilica very much and it really doesn't take to long to visit.",
          "Well worth a stop. Stunning gothic architecture and lovely stained glass windows. Pretty little placa, too",
          "It was closed when we were there, but such beautiful architecture - we didn't regret coming to see it.",
          "This old Gothic Church has been rebuilt after it was burned in the 1930's revolution. It is a fascinating place to visit. You can climb over 100 stairs to reach the roof and marvel at the great views of Barcelona.",
          "Pretty cool architecture, imagine they built this without modern technology. The details of the structure was quite interesting.",
          "This was definitely worth seeing, but in our opinion, pales in comparison to the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia. There were some unique features but we did not feel the price was worth the experience. In fact, the Barcelona Cathedral is very close by and was much less",
          "Gaudy spent the last 40 years of his life working on this masterpiece. Words, even pictures cannot convey how amazing and moving the Basillica is.",
          "I forgot the guide name, but he is a young boy who are informative and explained to us clearly about the background, history and future maintenance of the basilica. He did an excellent job as guide. The rooftop view of Barcelona is great. You can access some area that general",
          "This is the cathedral about which the miniseries was written. It is more intimate than the main cathedral and an easy visit even on Sunday.",
          "This is a majestic cathedral with great presence and grandeur. Some of the chapels date from the 14th century. Free to visit and a must see.",
          "This is a church in Le born quarter, not far from the water. Architecturally nice from the outside, but you don\u2019t appreciate the size and beauty of the church and its painted windows, until you go inside and take a look, which one should do. Free entry, and calm, relaxing",
          "The church's architecture is similar to many other built during the period but was well worth a visit. During the time we were there, the local children were celebrating their first holy communion. Seeing them dressed in traditional outfits for the ceremony was an unexpected",
          "a cute little church in the heart of the old district very subdued in comparison to the cathedral and Gaudi basilica Stop for some wine and a cheese/meat platter in the afternoon at one of the little spots in the square right in front of the basilica and watch the world go by",
          "I would recommend having the guided tour, it really added a lot in terms of understanding the architecture and themes Gaudi used",
          "If you love seeing churches, this is a good one. It was close to where we stayed so it was a quick but worth while visit.",
          "The architecture on the outside is breath taking. So many amazing details. I stood there and just tried to take it all in. Unfortunately you must pay to see the interior but it is worth it. So many rich beautiful details.",
          "You must book tickets well in advance for tickets to see inside. When we got there (11am) we were told that all tickets for today were sold!! The Cathedral is magnificent BUT it is positioned right on the road and in the centre of town! Not what I was expecting I suppose.",
          "The history around Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar gives you a great understanding into the lives of the people during the construction and the simplicity of the sanctuary. A humbling visit and one you should take time to visit.",
          "The Church is really beautiful, specially after you get to know something about its building history.",
          "I was astounded that this little historical church charged a fee if one wanted to get in! Barcelona has become a place where tourists are charged for every monument. .",
          "We were passing by & saw the church, it looks nice from the outside. There are certain times throughout the day when entry is free. There are souvenir shops & places to get food outside.",
          "I am so glad we were able to see this. It is truly stunning. Save time to enjoy the area around the Basilica.",
          "Breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful space, open chapels (no bars, gates or keys) and you can still light a real candle here. No matter how many times I visit this church, alone or in company, for a service or concert, or just to wander around, her magic never fails.",
          "Very nice cathedral, near to the port, very nice surroundings. The only bad point is the ticket price. Anyway, it's worth visiting it even if only from exterior.",
          "If you have time, there are times of the day entry is free so I would suggest to wait to save money. The church is very beautiful on the inside and worth spending 30 minutes or so walking around.",
          "The church was built in 55 years and completed in 1384. It is the only surviving church in the pure Catalan Gothic style. The interior is very impressive with three same height naves which are underpinned by very tall columns set 13 meters apart. This gives an impression of",
          "Quieter than other Barcelona churches but very interesting and a beautiful space. No tour required it is self explanatory",
          "Great insider tour of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Mar. Our guide Biel was fantastic! Knowlegeable, friendly and handled questions extremely well. Spectacular views of Barcelona and interesting to see different perspectives of Cathedral. Well worth it.",
          "We visited the church which was very beautiful. The Born area surrounds the Basilica is worth walking around. Many nice restaurants and nice shops.",
          "My husband and I visited here on 7/13/18. We just got the admission ticket of 4\u20ac senior rate per person. Love the street signs in Barcelona which direct you to the different sites. We followed the ones pointing the way to this lovely church. As we neared the church I noticed",
          "We booked an excursion with TUI for a guided tour of Barcelona and this church was part of the tour. Finding out the history of this church was interesting and well worth the price of the tour, it is truly breathtaking both inside and outside with a total sense calm about it.",
          "One of the books about Barcelona, which awakened in me the desire to visit Barcelona and that temple was \"La catedral del mar\" Ildefonso Falcones. Santa Maria del Mar is a church with quite low towers and no excessive decorations. Construction began in 1329. Huge stones were",
          "We visited it during the afternoon, it was very crowded but we were mainly impressed by how big and beautiful it is. Simply breathtaking. You must come and see it to understand the feeling it can give you.",
          "The history of the church was the subject of a book by Alfonso Falcones. The church is very peaceful and has some beautiful chapels and sculptures.",
          "We visited this Basilica at about 1.30 PM and found the tour quite nice. This place is not suitable for the elderly on account of the number of stairs to be climbed. Also the staircase is narrow and winding so can give a very claustrophobic feeling. My parents decided to stay",
          "This is a beautiful peaceful space to pray, connect with yourself, meditate and put up a candle, you will want to stay a while. They do have beautiful music recitals there as well. The space is almost completely unadorned, which adds to its pure authentic energy. Love it - will",
          "Did this as part of private tour. Gorgeous and interesting history of how it was built. Highly recommend!",
          "This is a beautiful gothic church with a very interesting history. There is 1 new stain glass that was installed recently to commemorate the Olympic Games held in Barcelona. Well worth a trip",
          "The church is just beautiful. It\u2019s huge and stunning. The architecture is impressive. Very detailed and also very quiet inside. You can have peace for some minutes after being in the busy streets.",
          "We stumbled upon this church but couldn't get in as there was a wedding, so glad we passed it again later on in our visit as it is a truly wonderful church",
          "This is a magnificent church and well worth the admission price if you're a tourist. If you want to worship then you need to find out the times of the masses. There's never an admission charge during formal worship times. Most of the one star reviews are complaining about",
          "I went here after visiting Barcelona cathedral. Visually it\u2019s not as impressive but we went on a well priced and very informative tour. It was a Spanish/English tour and the tour guide spoke great English. We learned a lot about the history of the church and some interesting",
          "It's a lovely place to see we took the tram up to the top it was well worth the trip up to the top. you get probably the best view's of the chapel from the top of o cage ride you stand up in a cage it rotates to the top then stops. This was included in the tram ride ticket.",
          "Dont miss this hidden gem. Loved seeing this church. It is in the old city area. yes, it's another church, but this one has the history of the area in it...",
          "The tour was good. The guide was knowledgeable and gave ample information. We could go till the top of the tower and see the view. Overall a good experience!",
          "We\u2019re not big on visiting churches but went to this one as it was recommended. It is a lovely church true to its gothic style, it was 5\u20ac entrance or 8.50\u20ac for rooftop access and full tour. There wasn\u2019t much of a queue so we hardly waited and were lucky with the timing for the",
          "Today, being Easter Sunday, it was very crowded and since we were going to mass we fortunately were able to enter a side door. Beautiful service with excellent music.",
          "We visited this impressive church in the gothic area on Sunday morning and enjoyed the music and the mass there.",
          "Amazing enormous basilica with so much history, built and designed by the poor people for the poor people. Loved the ceilings and the story behind the basilica. So much worth seeing.",
          "While most people flock to La Sagrada and Barcelona Cathedral, our friend in the city recommended we visit Santa Maria del Mar and it was lovely and easily accessible. Nice to visit after a stroll or lunch in the neighborhood.",
          "There comes a time where there are just so many cathedrals to visit It seems to me that after 3 weeks of Spain and Portugal- I am looking for other experiences But they all are wonderful in their way",
          "Whilst on holiday last week we came on the Basilica whilst walking around the Gothic area of Barcelona. It wasn\u2019t too busy inside so plenty of room to move around and have a good look. It really was stunning and so peaceful. We lit candles in memory of family very precious to us.",
          "We were strolling around the old quarter and came across this wonderful cathedral. I read the book \"The Cathedral of the Sea\" by Ildefonso Falcones some years ago so this was doubly interesting. Well worth the visit. Spectacular!",
          "Beautiful inside, I love the chandeliers, rose window and vaulted ceiling. Free to just walk in and enjoy the peace inside.",
          "Amazing architecture and still not finish and likely won't be a long time. Trip to the tower is worth the $ for the view alone but do not expect to race down the stairs which are narrow, curved and steep.",
          "This is very close to the Barcelona Cathedral and is well worth a visit when you are in the area. Unlike the Cathedral, there is no charge to enter( although the Cathedral ois free to visit between 8:30 and 12:30.",
          "As places of worship go, the Cathedral of the Sea is pretty special, and not least for the magic of its history which is experiencing a renewal of interest in the wake of the new Netflix series. Bathed in tricky sunlight and gloomy lights, it has a really different feel to the",
          "This majestic piece of architecture stands in a small square that makes it impossible to appreciate its beauty and it is all surrounded by the typical narrow roads of the cities Gothic centre except for the Square at its back. Apart from the massiveness of this temple that is",
          "It's a beautiful church located in the Born area of Barcelona. The acoustics are great and if there are any concerts, highly recommended.",
          "This was my favourite place to visit in Barcelona.We first saw the cathedral at night and decided to return to see it in daylight the next day.We arrived early and did not have to queue.Entry is free but we did pay \u20ac3 each to catch the lift to the roof.What a wonderful view! You",
          "Excellent stain glass work. One of the best I viewed in Spain - Barcelona, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Pamplona, Bilbao and Madrid. I enjoy visiting churches, Basilicas and Cathedrals in Europe and this did not disappoint. The interior architecture is similar to many others of its",
          "Interesting church, but not worth the entrance fee (7 EUR, I think). That said, it is well worth visiting for Mass, when admission is free (and Mass was quite lovely, even though I couldn\u2019t understand any of it).",
          "Beautiful cathedral - built by the poorer people of Barcelona and built with love - it's where Gaudi went every week to pray and where he was going on the day that he was killed by a tram. I went to the Mass in the morning, which gave me free access to the cathedral and was a",
          "Whole of El Born and the Gothic Quarter are lovely, but this is a great stop off point for a drink and tapas. The Basilica itself is beautiful. Certainly worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful church with the eternal burning flame outside. After the big fire FC Barcelona donated a big donation. And cozz of that donation they honered the club with logo stained glass window!",
          "There is so much to see in the Barri G\u00f2tic but thi is a mist see. One of the most impressive church\u2019s in the city you will just stumble across it as you are exploring. I recommend going in and walking through this impressive place.",
          "Wow! People build gorgeous things. Find the mirror that you can take a selfie in and it has the entire background of the church ceiling in it with you. If you want to read everything make sure to block out a good amount of time. The tower is a very intense walk if you are up for",
          "While everybody is queuing up to the cathedral, I recommend going to Basilica de Santa del Mar instead. We had hardly any waiting and you find an equally great, beautiful experience. Take your time and enjoy the peace and quiet.",
          "This is very impressive construction and spacious. It is just destroyed with queuing and noisy tourists. What a shame.",
          "Simple but beautiful Gothic church near sea in Barcelona's Gothic quarter. We did the guided tour this time with trip to rooftop. Very informative.",
          "Austere from the outside in Ribera section, this Gothic basilica is spacious and inspiring from the inside. History: Although a church at this site was mentioned as early as ~1000(when in fact closer to the sea than now) the current structure was largely built in the 14th",
          "This is a very large and beautiful Basilica with a large number of richly decorated enclaves dedicated to a number of different people or saints. Great photos and would recommend friends and family to visit.",
          "This basilica was mere steps from our apartment in the El Born neighborhood. Once inside this would be the centerpiece in any other city in Spain or anywhere else for that matter. I like to visit churches when I travel, this is one of the best.",
          "It's a beautiful place, everyone must visit. Lots of history. We were lucky to witness a wedding when we visited, and it was so romantic...",
          "If you have the time read the historic novel about the cathedral by the sea. It gives you a vivid picture and makes the experience even more special. Take the time to go inside and see the small chapels along the walls and take in the light and silence.",
          "An old cathedral with just absolute beauty. there are free entrance times, so take advantage of them.",
          "It's like nothing you have ever seen before. A must do. Be sure to book tickets online in advance, and get the option of going up the towers, its a fun experience.",
          "beautiful, just like in tv. made me remember the television novel based on the cathedral. went to mass there",
          "Really enjoyed this cathedral. It has a great deal of history and although austere, it\u2019s stained glass windows are worth the 5 euro admission.",
          "worthwhile to see, impressive, doesn't take long. dont think need tour for this or to wait long in line.",
          "Before you head to Barcelona, consider reading \"Cathedral of the Sea\", a historical novel featuring this Basilica. When the church was constructed (started in 1329, and completed -- incredibly -- in just 54 years, thanks to parishioners, neighbors, and stevedores who helped",
          "We went around noon and the church was free to enter. We decided we wanted to wait for the 1:15 tour and we are glad we did. Our guide was very knowledgeable and helpful. All around a pleasant experience. He took us up the tower to stand at the rose and explained the",
          "I was not so impressed by the basilica, it is free entrance, once inside is ok to look up to see the height, but it is an average attraction.",
          "Avoid the crowds at the Barcelona Cathedral and walk a few blocks to this church where you can enjoy a fantastic example of Catalan gothic architecture.. This church dates back to the 1300's with much of the original structure intact.. A peaceful, not crowded, gem.. Made for a",
          "We took our own tour. This is a marvelous Gothic Cathedral. The ornate side alters are immense. It was special for us to see the San Domiano Cross hanging over the alter, as it is the same cross that hangs in our church in Maryland. Take the time to explore.",
          "Awesome, yet tranquil, with far fewer tourists than at other attractions, helping us enjoy not only the architecture and overall artistry, but the holiness of the place.",
          "Went in the evening opening from 5pm. No waiting to enter. Very impressive building with wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommended.",
          "It\u2019s not the biggest or the most spectacular but it doesn\u2019t claim to be either. It\u2019s well worth popping in if you\u2019re in the gothic quarter. The columns and stained glass windows make for great photographs.",
          "A nice old Gothic cathedral but fairly simply done. Barcelona has so many fantastic buildings that coming to this unremarkable cathedral seems like a poor use of time.",
          "We booked a guided tour from home and paid less than we would have if we had tried on the day. It is popular so always busy. We met our guide at Julia Travel next the Sagrada and collected our ticket. We were thne part of a group of 30 provided with an in depth historyand",
          "I hate to mark as average, but it pretty much is that when compared to all the churches in Spain. They are all spectacular. There is small admission charge (couple euros) which I am happy to pay to help maintain the site.",
          "One of my favorite cathedrals in Barcelona. The history of it is also fascinating. I would recommend anyone to visit it.",
          "This basilica/church is a very beautiful place with perfect architecture and a wonderful place to see and be.",
          "A beautiful church in the south part of Gothic Quarter, so there is a small square in front, many restaurants/chocolate shops and very close to Picasso Museum.",
          "Not usually thrilled about going on a roof of a building but I did this and was well rewarded. The stairs were a little hard to climb but well worth it. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get a wonderful view of Barcelona",
          "We have always fancied visiting old churches, as it gives you a glimpse of the life way back when and another place to pray and thank God for allowing you to visit places like this. If you are like us, then you should take the time to visit the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar.",
          "This beautiful basilica is located in Born district. You can go there by Metro yellow Line 4, Jaume I. station. We walked along the narrow streets and went into this real Gothic cathedral. I think it isn't as famous as the Saint Eulalia Basilica, but it worth a visit. We were",
          "Worth a visit. This is less fancy than the other basilica or cathedral of the city, maybe that's why it feels more alive.",
          "The architecture of the Gothic area of Barcelona is a very interesting piece of this city's heritage. There are a lot of details that will move you in how this came about. A true experience.",
          "Despite being in the book Cathedral of the sea. I think it is a very nice church to visit in Barcelona. Also you can take the opportunity to eat something in the Borne area. It is full of restaurants and nice area to walk and to see designers.",
          "Such amazing feeling looking straight up to through the giant pillars. Very detailed sculpture and amazing feeling of calm throughout the building.",
          "An amazing place!! Must visit when you're in Barcelona! One of the most beautiful buildings in the city.",
          "I like architecture. I will become a 5 star in something like this. But what I like is the care that you can see. The beauty and history in it is just moving.",
          "A must see in Barcelona, better than many other more \"advertised\" sites! In the heart of the Gothic neighborhood.",
          "Expensive to get in - but worth the trip outside to the top! Lovely View from the top. Historically very interesting",
          "I had read before visiting that it was free to enter after 4.30; we arrived at 4.00 and found it wasn't free until after 5.00 so paid to go in as didn't want to wait an hour. Well worth a visit, even if paying the moderate fee of 5 euros, 4 euros for concessions.",
          "On paying at the entrance you receive a leaflet with the details of every side chapel. Quite interesting. Don t forget to walk up to the first floor at the end of the church to have a nice overview.",
          "We walked around the area and were mesmerized at the old architecture. Definitely worth a visit and get lost among the old streets walking around.",
          "I love architecture so I've always going to be 5 stars on something like this But what I loved about it was the care that you could see the city puts into the structure Everything look like it has been well upkept Really truly a gorgeous building and the history in it is just",
          "Great Basilica; amazing work and very well preserved. Free entrance also; so please ensure you visit it",

          "After the basilica don.t miss the medieval cloister with fountains and even more chapels...................and 13 white geese!",
          "Charming, impressive and something special which makes this Basilica a must on your bucket list when visiting Barcelona.",
          "incredible ambience added to with the definite feel of history. The Basilica Santa Maria del Mar is great spot to visit",
          "This cathedral is pretty grand. Of course, it doesn't get as much publicity as the Sagrada Familia but it should. It's free to enter the church. You can also climb to the top of the tower for a view of Barcelona. They have an English/Spanish tour of the top at 5 pm, for 8 euros.",
          "I have read La Catedral del Mar and was keen to visit it, it was special not only because of the cathedral itself but because I could walk all the surrounding streets. Reading the book and then doing the visit made my time there even more enjoyable.",
          "This church is so beautiful and somewhere I will visit every time we visit Barcelona. So calm and peaceful - much more understated than Sagrada",
          "Beautiful structure in the center of the old city. It's worth the wait in line and modest fee to get in (kids are free). There's an elevator to the top of the building with offers great city views.",
          "Tucked away in the Gothic Quarter, this church had a really lovely feeling about it, and wasn't absolutely flocked with tourists. I found I could get in for free by going in the back entrance.",
          "Wonderful historic building - lots of character and interesting features. It is well worth seeking it out and spending some time there.",
          "I guarantee that you\u2019ve never seen a more impressive ceiling! Unbelievable. The place is incredible.",
          "We were strolling and admiring the narrow passage ways of el Born when we came across the simple looking gothic building. The outside of the Basilica is misleading as inside one discovers a marvel of gothic architecture , with high ceilings and beautiful stained glass windows.",
          "A church in Barcelona where at certain times of the day you can enter for really religious purpose without paying those expensive tickets. Free entrance: Monday - Sunday h. 10:00 - 14:00 & h. 17:00 - 20:00",
          "Gothic style building, with some simple beauty of architecture and plenty of space inside. Not as luxurious as the cathedral, but also splendorous. Worth visiting.",
          "I read the book (the one from Adalfonso Falcones) so I had to come to visit this church. I have to admit that even it's not the most beautiful I've ever seen, it's my favourite one. I couldn't say why, but I feel very well inside of it. It's a must see for those who are",
          "Just beautiful and under estimated, not as famous as La Sagrada Familia but it is as beautiful and worth to visit, free admission and a wonderful experience",
          "Such a simple building. Yet so well done. Take a tour with the roof view. You will not be sorry. Just keep in mind, there is some workout going up those stairs.",
          "I strongly recommend this place and the guide tour which will take you to the rooftop. Have been to many churches and this is the first one I can step on the second floor. And Learned a lot from the guide.",
          "We went on this tour with my vife., but this is good experience for al family! This historical, nolligeble brith taking views. You can spend a week over there,and not going to be enoughtime to see everething. On the top of it it so many trails over there. I am going to recommend",
          "It's really worth to stop for few minutes in this raw but beautiful place. The entrance is for free.",
          "Dont miss this and the area it is in. Best area of Barcelona. Amazing coffee shops and restaurants, even though Barcelona has lots of them - these stand out.",
          "An absolutely stunning piece of architecture! We stopped here during an e-bike tour and were told about the history of the building and had chance to take a walk around inside. So much detail has gone into creating such a beautiful church. The ceilings tower above you once",
          "great church with great architecture , very solemn, highly recommend to visit lots of saints to see and pray",
          "A masterpiece of Gothic, every inch inside and out is covered with the most ornate decor spanning over time, inside stone ceilings soar in ornate splendid while down below wood carvings of saints sinners and gargoyles stare hauntingly or warmly at you, each alter has its own",
          "This 800 year old marvel is over shadowed by the gigantic and famous Sagrada Familia and the Cathedral de Barcelona. However, it is worth the visit. The architecture and the detailed sculpting and paintings inside are 500-800 years old and amazing. It is also close to a market",
          "Very hard to find in the mix of all the buildings in the Jewish Quarter. However it was well worth the time. Beautiful place. Very nice to get a tour from one of the people who work at the basilica. Only couple euro to get in per person. If you like photography this will be a",
          "Nice casual place to visit. Close to beach and shopping you can fit it in without going out of your way. We arrived at Mass so we stayed. Beautiful architecture and unique location.",
          "Incredible atmosphere to be enjoyed at different moments because inner light changes as long as daylight does. Plus the surrounding neighbourhood is full of charm and history.",
          "This is another nice church but once you've been to the Sagrada everything else pales in comparison, still worth visiting though if you're in the area.",
          "Because of the history of this place, this is for me the nicest church in Barcelona. it shows the determination of the human being..",
          "Wonderful church with its special atmosphere inside. Mostly i loved the high ceilings. The only minus is the huge amount of tourists.",
          "Stunning architecture, a real masterpiece of Spanish religious architecture.The columns are simply beautiful and impressive as well as the stained glass and other features. The exterior, on the other hand, is quite plane and doesn't prepare yourself for the amazing interior.",
          "I am not at all religious but I really loved the architecture and religious artifacts. I found it very peaceful. I would recommend a visit.",
          "We spent so much time here! We loved everything and the audio guide was very helpful. It was cold inside those ancient stone walls so make sure you are prepared. Also because the church is huge, be prepared to have lotsa energy. We had to leave, not because we were done",
          "It's okay but nothing majorly special. Wouldn't recommend paying for it. Watch out for scammers here!",
          "Beautiful historic church worth a visit. Easy to get in and out while walking through the Gothic Quarters. A cost free activity which is great for couples, families and children.",
          "was beautiful old church. we went on the self guided tour $7 euros. went to the roof and was able to see the whole city. it took about 75 minutes to see everything. well worth the stop",
          "What a beautiful church in the Ribera district. An excellent example of Catalan Gothic architecture. Very atmospheric interior and lovely views of picturesque side streets from either side of the church. Excellent views over Barcelona.",
          "One of the most beautiful Basilicas in Barcelona! Gothic and marvellous architecture and quiet environment! There is an admission fee.",
          "This basilica isn't as obvious as the Sagrada Familia. However, if you appreciate ancient architecture, you will really like it. Inside, you can see how old it is, and yet it stands majestically in the middle of Barcelona. It is spectacular. Well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful, awe inspiring church in El Born. I thought it might be hard to find, but we stumbled on it several times exploring the neighborhood. We went in later in the day. There was no line and it has very nice pictures and alters. You can take your time calmly walking through.",
          "Although the Basilica is not as showy as the Sagrada Familia, it is definitely worth a visit. It is beautiful inside and not as busy as some of the other landmarks. My advice would be to visit in the morning, before the tours start. You do not need to book online and can walk",
          "It's made With golden ratio proportion in plan and section of space. So the sense of space was calm and also absorbing. Warm lighting inside the building makes me stay as long as I can. The height of the space was about 15 meters. Covered with bricks and stones and there are",
          "Despite the long queues, it's a wonderful experience to see the interior of Gaudi's masterpiece which has the most stunning light. The Nativity fa\u00e7ade is spectacular.",
          "This is a gothic masterpiece with a soaring intereior with large amounts of stained glass, Definitly worth including on your visit to the city",
          "On all your travels, you will invariably encounter places of religious worship. From the humble little chapel to cavernous monstrosities, they exist globally - some beautiful, tranquil places to reconnect with your inner self and your faith, others just cold, functional and on a",
          "The church does guided tours for \u00a38.50 . They are really informative and you get a great view of the city. You are also contributing to the upkeep of the church. Highly recommended",
          "Beautiful 14th century church, which is well worth a visit. It didn't look much from exterior you could walk past it, but the imposing interior is beautiful. Visiting just before 5pm, we almost had place to ourselves.",
          "If you're looking to avoid the crowds, come here. This is incredible inside. What an amazing piece of architecture. Visit the roof top and you will get amazing views of Barcelona.",
          "By all accounts this is a beautiful church - you need to see it in pictures.Unfortunately, we had just come from St Peter's basilica in Rome, so a little underwhelmed",
          "This is completely worth the time to stroll through... well located, so make sure you don\u2019t accidentally walk right past it.",
          "It's easy to get on church-cathedral-Basilica overload in Barcelona. Still, it's very much worth visiting here, even for a short while, on your walk about the Gothic Quarter. Quite beautiful.",
          "It was the first thing we visited, arriving to Barcelona. It's a wonderful Cathedral worth visiting more than once. The beauty about it is that every chair, every wall, every column, every detail inside is unique and different that the other. If symmetry gives beauty, then this",
          "This is the kind of church where the locals go every Sunday, and they put up with the tourists because of the sacred feeling you get when you go inside.",
          "After you're all Gaudi'd up, come to Basilica de Santa Maria for an truly incredible experience - a beautiful church with a great story, but make sure you also take one of the guided tours up to the roof. Our guide was wonderful, gave a very informative talk about the history",
          "Visiting this Basillica one is confronted with true amazement of the very high columns. From the outside there isn't much area to take a great photgraph of the entire Basillica from the front, however once inside it is a different story. Definitely wortn visiting as its",
          "The basilica (church with some reliquias) is immense, breath taking. Do not expect an elaborate interior, to the contrary, all the interior walls are simple, neat, no ornaments which would unduly disturb the harmonious distribution of the space. Not to be missed the technical",
          "The church is beautiful inside and definitely worth a peek. I thought it was interesting that FCB donated or sponsored the church so thus, has their logo on a stain glass window.",
          "I have to mention first and foremost, it is perhaps galling to some to have to pay to visit a church however, even the Sagrada cathedral can be visited without having to pay - if you go to mass at certain times of the day/evening. Like very many of these churches, if you love",
          "This church is in a really built up area and it's really hard to appreciate the building from the outside being in such a strange place. I didn't pay for a ticket to go in, I didn't really have the time to go inside and begrudge paying to go into a church - more than happy to",
          "It seems that there is a book about this nice building. There are plenty of walking tours based on the book. In my last trip to Barcelona I enjoyed the visit of the cathedral very much. Lots of nice places to eat and drink in the surrounding area.",
          "A lovely old church, impressive and beautiful. We had the luck to find it when walking through the Gothic Quarter, and even more lucky to get there at sunset. The interior is nice and warm lighted, with a lovely garden. The veiw from the terrace is amazing, if you are lucky",
          "Discovered while wandering the neighborhood. We literally entered through a side door. What a marvel - not to be missed.",
          "During my late afternoon wandering in Barcelona I walked to Santa Maria Del Mar Towers + Terraces + Galleries guided tour. Paid (\u20ac8) for guided tower tour. Amazing views of the city via a narrow winding staircase. I was there for approximately 90 minutes but that included",
          "3rd church of the day & a bit churched fatigued. However the jewel in the crown. Beautiful, peaceful & the whole experience shouldn\u2019t be missed. The lady who took our money pointed out the right route, helpfully pointing out the WCs I thin noticing we were of a certain",
          "This is a lovely basilica that provides an interesting contrast in construction type and architectural style to much of the Gaudi design you see all over BCN. I didn't feel that I missed anything by not paying for a tour.",
          "Tried three times to have a pray in this church, but I should pay for it, which I denied. The Catholic Church is one of the richest enterprises in the world, and they converted this traditional place build up with medieval inquisition slavery. They say that the money collectged",
          "Christmas seemed a good time to visit as there were hardly any queues which I can imagine there being at busier times of the year.A superb building,breath taking.",

          "The title in Spanish of a lovely book by C.Zafon that you can get in any language describes the construction of this magnificent church. What I do like about is the cool inside magnitude. Worth to be visited at any time",
          "I invesrigated the hiatory of this place before the visit. It is one of the most important basilicas in Barcelona. Check the schedule it.s free sometimes. The capilla was closed. Also you can visit the towels with a tour. I do not understand why the government not invest money",
          "Fabulous ambience and amazing interior. Well worth the visit. A service was underway on our first occasion so returned on another day to see it without disturbing the service and make the most of the visit.",
          "Gothic Church, as expected. I hesitate to call it unadorned, but I found the exposed stone walls inspirational. You have the feeling people actually built this, and worshipped here as we see it, sometimes missing in more ornately decorated structures. To me, at least.",
          "Just sitting in the pews and looking up at the organic columns is inspirational. But then add the colors from the windows and it becomes a religious experience for anyone. Recommend late afternoon to have better sunlight on the windows. Take time to just sit and watch.",
          "This is a vast church set in a small square in stone brickwork complete with turrets and oval shaped windows and grand door entrances. Inside it's huge with giant pillars as support, a pretty alter and nice alcoves.",
          "We came for a fabulous performance of Handel's Messiah. The church made a great setting for it, the acoustics were amazing. Wheelchair accessibility No problem - ramp provided and wheelchair users simply sat in the aisle.",

          "nice but small and a bit dark, full of tourists but worth a look in. service would be nice to attend",
          "Cannot go to Barcelona without seeing this. Words cannot explain the detail or dynamics of the Basilica. Must see in daylight and at night. This is a stop on the on and off bus route",
          "Hidden away down the windy streets is this beautiful building. Free entry and better location than the more famous Cathedrals the city has to offer. The architecture is beautiful and there's an overwhelming sense of peace as you enter. We would visit everyday after breakfast,",
          "Definitely worth a stop. The entrance is free and some guides run tours in different languages. It takes no more than 20 min to go around.",
          "well worth the few euros to get in, impressive throughout with a courtyard that has swans! shame about the fake piped parakeet calls from the speakers, why?",
          "There is a much more famous Cathedral that you have to queue for 30 mins+ to get into in Barcelona and you will probably visit it and pay your 26 euros entree. They need the money for further building after all!!! This Cathedral is finished. It was finished a while ago. It's",
          "Very beautiful church at the Born district. It lies hidden in the streets. You can visit it for free on several occasions. Fun fact, inside the church, one of the glass windows has the weaponsshield of Fc Barcelona. Can you find it?",
          "This basilica is very impressive and the best example of gothic Catalan architechture. From the top (there is an elevator) you have a view of 360 degree",
          "The guide explained the architecture being the best example of gothic Catalan architecture where the height of the church and nave was similar so no flying buttresses were needed. Beautiful interior space. The sea used to be much closer when the church was built quickly",
          "The columns are Gaud\u00ed inspirations for his columns. Nice church with lots of history. Worth a visit if you are in the Gothic area",
          "A grand basilica that is beautiful in its simplicity. We visited after 5 pm and did not have to pay an entry fee. We enjoyed just sitting in a pew and soaking it all in.",
          "We showed up at dusk. We bought tickets to got to the roof of the cathedral as the sun was setting. It was lovely!",
          "The chuches in Barcelona are wonderful and open to everyone. I do recommend a visit to this church. We arrived during mass and sat quietly in the back.",
          "Santa Maria del Mar is a church in the Ribera district of Barcelona, built between 1329 and 1383. It is free before 1 PM. It is not a heavily visited Basilica so you can really enjoy the interior and admire the Gothic architecture.",
          "Free before 1pm and if you go on a Sunday, you get to see the cathedral in action which is incredible. Beautiful grounds and just takes your breath away. If you go on a walking tour before visiting you will hear the story of why the Geese are in the courtyard and its so",
          "You would think that after seeing the Sagrada Familia nothing else would be worth a look. You might be almost right, until you see the Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar, a really beautiful Gothic church. It's extravagant, but not as much as the Gaudi masterpiece!",
          "Is a good place to visit ! You can see the glowing with the lights and the details of the gothic style church, even not with religious belief, is still a good place to feel history and see the architect style.",

          "A beautiful old building with a huge worship space. Well worth the visit if only to hear about the desecration it has endured. We did a guided tour including the roof and the only \"surprise\" was the need to climb about 120 steep steps (up and down) to get to the roof. The views",
          "If you have overdosed on the Modernist architecture of Barcelona this church makes a welcome contrast. Understated where the Sagrada Familia is flamboyant, generally accessible without a long wait, situated in the picturesque Gothic Quarter and convenient to much of downtown,",
          "Not as spectacular as strata da familia but worth a visit . Plenty of visitors but not too busy .beautiful inside and there were plenty of photo opportunities outside.it is a stop on the red bus route and can be visited in about an hour. We spent about an hour on site.",
          "Wonderful gothic designs with the organ music provides a body shuddering experience. The roof tour included in the seven euro entry provides breath taking City views. Kids get in for free. There is also a courtyard with ducks.",
          "The Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar is very much worth seeing. The basilica is a beautiful house of worship located in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The church is beautiful, but is subtle in its construction and decor. The church does have some of the most impressive stained",
          "In the hearth of the Born an impresive church stands. Its tall colomns give the visitor and incredible sensation of calm and quietness...it seems that heaven is inside. To know more about this wonderful place, don\u2019t hesitate to read La Catedral del Mar.",
          "Spain has is share of Basilicas, Churches and Cathedrals but not are all the same. Some less dramatic others more and some even impressive. The archetectual style of this one is impressive and worth a visit.",

          "This church is beautiful, with wonderful stained glass. It is very simply adorned. You really feel the history of Catalan struggle sitting in this church, which was burned during the Civil War and conflicts during the Franco regime. A sombre reflective space.",

After the official tour, I went on my own to the balconies to see the inner church from above. There are beautiful devotional images in the side chapels",
          "Lovely small religious place to visit, full of history from ancient Barcelona and the people who build it. Next to the Basilica there is also a commemorative space for those who lost their lives in the 1714's Barcelona Siege, very interesting and emotive to visit.",

It is nice just to sit down and take in the beautiful architecture and statues.",

          "Absolutely amazing. The tickets are for the tours but if you want to just visit the church you don't have to pay. Everything about this church us truly miraculous.",
          "Such a beautiful place to see. The architecture, the history and love is amazing at Sagrada familia. Definitely recommend the guided tour it's very informative and I felt I took more from this than an audio guide version. Really enjoyed my visit",
          "Beautiful church. We weren\u2019t able to go inside, but the sign gave a number of different prices, starting at \u20ac5 for simple entry. There is a slightly higher price for a guided tour.",
          "Like stepping back in time. Loved how it was a real church that is used by the locals. There was a local celebration and mad going on it when we visited. So authentic and beautiful",

This was a special moment for us.",

          "A beautiful temple in Barcelona. Worth to visit it in daylight time because of its stained glass windows. Wide spaces and light every where. A good expression of Gothic movement.",
          "Whether you're Catholic or not this is a must.  The construction, history and detail to every part of the church is amazing.",
          "Beautiful Gothic church in the heart of Barcellona. The very slender columns support steep vaults and let the inside be filled with natural light. You can almost feel the flow of the centuries on the surfaces of these walls. Note the church \u2026",
          "Walking thru (what I think) is the gothic section off of Las Ramblas, we ran into this. No clue as we continued to walk the city. Great for a photog and amazing architecture in an otherwise concrete'ish jungle.",
          "Extraordinary iconic gothic architecture, a piece of history, you have to pay to get inside...",
          "Unbelievable excellent Cathedral in Barcelona dedicated to sailors before leaving sea away to work. This is why it is so close to the harbour. Unmissable visiting it.",

          "Very usual out side. Very surprising inside. With turning of pirates on the floor",
          "A spectacular meal. We wanted to try everything. The waiter was most helpful in making suggestions and advising how many tapas to order. The food was so good, we ordered way more than suggested! Get there early!",

          "Absolutely beautiful basilica. The architecture is breathtaking and the stainglass, paintings and sculptures put the citys contemporary art museums to shame. Highly recommend stopping in if the doors are open. I also liked all the crypts and the spiral stairs that lead to the beautiful organ . Definitely worth checking out",
          "The staff were quite rude, but it's a beautiful church, it's odd you have to pay to go into too.... I was lucky enough to hear choir singers in practice on my visit too which was majestic",

          "Great pizza at a great price. Don't expect Domino's or pizza hut style rubbish here, you're getting Spanish style thin bases on a bustling street with locals and tourists mixing.  If you fancy good pizza without worrying about it, come here, we did!",
          "Stumbled upon this church by mistake as we were looking for a bar to get a drink at. We came in towards the tail-end of mass. We were absolutely blown away by how beautiful and majestic this church is. You should most definitely stop in. I \u2026",

This was a special moment for us.",
          "Great building with amazing stained glass windows running around the whole building. The stained glass is worth the trip inside if you enjoy the light of the colours on a sunny day. The church is nicely formed and not to much flamboyant statues or artwork to take away the feeling of the space",
          "As usual in Spain you have to pay for entry if you're not here for worship, which is something that would've upset me when I was young but now makes total sense to me. I think it was around 7 euros and it is definitely worth it.",
          "Watch out for the lady with the carnation flowers. She came up to me at the front door of the church and stuck this flower into my shirt then asked me for 1 euro. If you go on Trip advisor, people will tell you she's trying to get you to \u2026",

          "Beautiful church and a nice plaza with restaurants.",
          "Great looking cathedral with a lot of history that is recommended to be looked into. Outside you can see the hard work put into it and inside it has great light and is a little unique to other cathedrals.",
          "Very nice church in el born.",
          "What a stunning basilica. Another one that's difficult to appreciate just because it's surrounded by buildings on all sides. It's very mind boggling to think that this basilica was on the coast (hence its name), as now its quite far and no longer has a view on the sea. Worth entering and appreciating its size as well as its stain glass.",

          "A beautiful example of classic Catalan gothic architecture built by the neighborhood fisherman in the 14th century. It's free to go inside so be sure to stop in if you're nearby.

          "There are \"free\" times to visit the church (after 5pm and in the morning), but if you want to go on the roof and terrace, you need to pay for the guided tour - at any time of day. The guided tour is 8.50 euros. Go at sunset - the views are \u2026",

          "As the ticket price goes up, my stars go down... I used to enter for free a couple of years ago. Now, 5 euros tickets... Same pattern as Barcelona cathedral, which went from zero to 8.5 euros in just a few years. If you want to charge, just do it, but do it right : make some investment. Improve the show....",
          "The serenity this sacred place offers is amazing.",
          "Truly stunning.",
          "Much better than the proper cathedral in the barrio g\u00f3tico. Worth reading up on its history, fascinating. Imposing but not as oppressive as most churches. The neighborhood is also very trendy.",
          "Stark compared to some churches, but filled with saints.  Imagine the mariners going off to sea ...",
          "Stroling in El Born area it's worth a visit the Basilica, 14th century Gothic style church. Its seems to be rather gray as for the Basilica but the construction it's stunning, not mentioning the time of the build.",
          "Amazing church so e people say it's a inspiration for Gaud\u00ed of Sagrada Familia",
          "Not as famous as some of the other churches in Barcelona, but easily the most beautiful. The graceful open space with light filtering through the stained glass is nothing less than majestic. Free to enter during weekday mornings.",

          "Like a number of places in Barcelona, the Basilica Dr Santa Maria del Mar is a gorgeous piece of architecture. Don't go there in shorts though. There's a dress code of sorts (although I'm not certain if it's enforced).",

          "We literally stumbled across the Arc and it was actually...gorgeous! It's even prettier and more ornate in person and also has a park attached to it. There are people around trying to sell things or entertain but it's not something you can't just walk by and ignore. Try to stop",
          "It does feel a little strange to see this here but don't expect it to be as large as Paris. It's not but still interesting to see.",

          "Great for a quick picture on your way around the city. Asides that nothing else to this arc in my opinion",
          "I wish there was a way to learn more about the Arc de Triomf while at the attractions itself. While this is a great architectural piece, it would be better to have some history or information about the piece WHILE seeing it. For those Instragrammers, please realize that many",

          "This is a part of a park actually it leads you to the park. Easy to reach by tube and there are plenty of benches to relax and observe locals and tourists.",
          "One of the more unique arches as it is build out of red brick. Absolutely beautiful. Located in a great spot, people just relaxing or walking their dogs. Such a nice atmosphere.",
          "I got robbed today, sitting in the sun, enjoying the music and ambiance. I sat down on a bench to feed the pigeons. I set my backpack down and had my eyes on the pigeons for 10 seconds and turned around and the BLUE Camelback brand backpack was gone. I am so distressed by this",
          "Decided to go for an evening walk to see the Arc de Triomf, absolutely stunning all lit up at night. Very quiet, so got loads of good photos. Felt very safe walking around the area.",
          "I love this area and I love this arc. It is a place where you can relax and there are lots of bars and restaurants not too far away. It is near the zoo and the Parc de la Ciutadella. You can walk directly from here across the road. You can sit here and watch the world go by.",
          "Beautiful architecture and an interesting new place with many street performers, also loved seeing birds nesting up on the arch.",
          "Went for a walk from our hotel and stumbled across this. The Arc de Triomf is situated within a large paved area and a park. The Arch is nice and good if you want some photo opportunities. Lovely area for a stroll.",
          "Visited this as Arc as we were paying through the area and it was required highly on TripAdvisor. We were slight disappointed as we got up close to the Arc as it is made of brick. Much less attractive than the arches in London and Paris. With a visit if in the area.",
          "Busy square and the Arc is quite a sight, there seems to be something happening here all the time, parades, street music or people selling things.",
          "The Arc isn\u2019t that remarkable, especially if you\u2019ve been to the Sagrada Familia or any of the other Gaud\u00ed sights. That being said this is a nice area and worth a look if your close by.",
          "Nice architectural soace with its square, next to Barceloneta. Good for a stride along the walk, especially at night",
          "Lovely walk through the area Well worth the walk to find it. Everything here is just stunning We was lucky with clear sky\u2019s in feb",
          "It's a WOW for me... The architecture will surely amaze everyone who will see it. I love the sway of fresh air brought out by the palms. there are lots of cafe options around. Nice for a walk.",
          "A large and very detailed arch considering it is made of brick. built as a gateway for the festival in 1888. Situated in a good area for cafes.",
          "We ran into the \"Arc de Triomphe\" by chance. It is located on a large square near the city park and the downtown area. This whole area is a good place to visit. The arch offered a nice photo opportunity. Nothing too special, and maybe not worth going to on its own, but with",
          "Arc de Triumph is located close to Parc de la Ciutadella and it's one of the best places in Barcelona to stroll around! Magnificent architecture and vibrant neighbourhood!",
          "This Arc de Triomphe was once built as the gateway to the World Expo. Great details and beautiful street surrounded by palm trees. A place worth seeing. Within walking distance of the park and zoo.",
          "It's a cool piece of architecture. The surrounding sidewalks are very nice, and at the end you can enter Parc de la Ciutadella. Good for pictures and if you like history. It was busy, but not overcrowded. People hanging out or filming themselves things like that.",
          "Nice little park in city with great area for selfies and group shots. Really cool details and history.",
          "This is a very impressive Arch built in 1888 as the main entrance to the world\u2019s fair held in city. Built from brick and adorned with very intricate carving it a very impressive. It is easy to reach by metro and a good start point for a walk through the park.",
          "I stumbled across tis monument as it's a stop on the hop on hop off bus. It's next to a free park and near the zoo so a good area to explore for a few hours.",
          "Exactly what it says on the tin. Beautiful red brick architecture that serves as a gateway to the park beyond. Very accessible via subway. I would have given it a higher mark but there were (like lots of attractions sadly), quite a few street sellers, musicians and people that",
          "This is a wonderful monument set in a very pleasant pedestrianised area complete with small turrets either side, intricate detail and fabulous figurines to the top. It's not quite as good as it's namesake but still worth seeing.",
          "This is close to a free park. It is free. It is not too far away from a metro station so it is convenient to visit.",
          "This red brick arc was built for the world exhibition in 1888 and has more of a decorative function than anything else. Good picture taking spot. Nice walk to the park below. Don't forget your \"urban skills\", keep an eye on your valuables and watch out for \"ladrones\"/thieves.",
          "Barcelona presents many photo opportunities. This Arc de Triomf may not have the prestige of the one in Paris, but it is unique in architectural style (neo- Mudijar). With a red brick facade and a highly decorated frieze. It was Barcelona's welcoming front door to the word",
          "To get straight to the point, we were mugged in the park. We enjoyed the Arc, the park, initially. But as we walked toward the Zoo, sat down to look at our map, the thieves were upon us. One took our phone that was next to my leg, handed it off to another and as I tried to",
          "I have seen the same thing in Paris but in Barcelona its quite fascinating. I like the park and they have boating facilities also. Impressive",
          "It was built as the main access gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. The arch crosses over the wide central promenade of the Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys, leading to the Ciutadella Park that now occupies the site of the world fair. If you take a close look at the arch you'll",
          "We went to see the place at daytime and evening because hotel was located close. At daytime there was some fixing being done and was not possible to have proper photo from the Arc without constructions. At the evening it was way better : )",
          "Located close to the train station - this is a nice place to come relax and take a break in your day.....you can do a lot of good people watching here as well. Many people will stop to take photos in front of the Arc. It's a really beautiful sight.",
          "The Arc de Triomf was built as a gateway to the Universal Exhibition in 1988 which was held in the Parc de la Ciutadella. This triumphal arch was built to exemplify the coming of age of Barcelona. Great stone statues adorn this arch along with detailed friezes. Truly beautiful.",
          "Been to Paris Arc De Triomphe so i was excited to see this attraction in barcelona. There were some events set up when we arrive so we did not manage to see up close. There is a nice park to walk nearby though. For me, this attraction is just another tick on my to do list.",
          "It's nice place to walk around. While we were there, it was Living library in progress so we could hear some really interesting stories!",
          "Was encouraged to come look at this arc by my other half. Was not that interested as have seen many arc etc. It has the classical shape but it's covered in beautiful red brick. Glad I saw it. Worth having a look at this iconic landmark.",
          "We got the apartment in the city which is walking distance to many theme in the city, enjoy the nice walk in the sun, in light rain, feeling so peaceful though was warn by hundreds of the pickpocket issues, the people here are so helpful and friendly and the food is great and at",
          "We had recently visited the Arc de Triomphe in Paris which we were awestruck by and had the opportunity to climb to the top and take photos of the city, etc. Therefore, visiting the Arc de Triomf in Barcelona seemed like a let down to us given the fact that it was much smaller",
          "Nice place to stopping by and look at the impressive Arc de Triomf. Nice to walk in the area and take a little break from the trip schedule.",
          "This is something you need to see if you want a nice little walk around and feel the spanish aroma. Worth seeing if you are nearby!",
          "The whole area is a very cool part of Barcelona. The promenade is excellent to wander down. Its easy to find and definitely worth a look to get a great Barcelona shot.",
          "The Arc de Triumf is a a nice monument to visit and from there you can take a nice walk on the promenade that leads you to Parc de le Cuitadella. Well worth it if you visit both of them it's a relaxing 15 min walk leading to the parc. The Arc is easily accessible from the Metro",
          "This is an impressive building but not really worth a trip on its own. You can walk under and around it and take photographs. There is usually a lot of activity in the adjacent pedestrian walkways and park so it is busy. Best seen as part of a walking or cycle tour.",
          "The arc is an interesting piece of architecture. Just 15 minute walk from the gothic quarter, worth going to for the photos.",
          "One of the key places in Barcelona. Very busy place so be careful while taking a photos of other people might take advantage of you not paying attention to your bag. At the moment under construction as you can see on my photos. However still worth the time. Make sure you will",
          "The history to this differs somewhat to the other triumphant arches to be found in Europe, it is also different in its architecture and decor to the surrounding buildings\u2019 adornments. I got to see this as part of our Segway tour.",
          "So there\u2019s this huge festival this weekend, and they\u2019re setting up a giant stage. The park side has the stage, the backside has trailers and fencing. Ugly. Disappointing. Otherwise it\u2019s beautiful.",
          "Great place to take photos. Lots of local shops nearby to eat after a walk around the Arc. The taxis drive through this area a lot too so it\u2019s easy to catch a cab after to your next destination. And it\u2019s a free tourist attraction!",
          "This was a very busy area and a little under whelming. It\u2019s only a few minutes walk from the citudella Park, so worth visiting I suppose, as you are there.",
          "The Arc de Triomf is a beautiful monument at the end of Passeig de Sant Joan. It's nice to spend a moment to look at this and admire the beauty. The monument is located close to Parc De Cuitadella",
          "We did the hop on hop off bus as we do in most cities. We hoped off at this stop and had a good walk around",
          "The Arc de Triomf (Arco de Triunfo) sits at the end of Passeig de Saint Joan with a lovely pedestrian avenue between it and Parc de la Cuitadella. It\u2019s a beautiful monument, built for the Universal Exposition held in 1888. Approaching it from the Parc side makes for a lovely",
          "This is a beautiful monument at the top of a long walkway. The area beyond it is teaming with life and it is nice to wander past something so beautiful, although you wouldn't stick around too long, once you've seen it that is basically it.",
          "Another must in Barcelona. It's free, it's great for pictures: the long stretch makes it great for walking or just sitting on the grass. Beautiful place, a lot of street performers and a bustling atmosphere.",
          "We loved visiting this park. There are many places to sit and enjoy the views of the city and the arc. Be sure to bring your camera!",
          "It was cool, we stopped by on our way to Sagrada Fam\u00edlia as it was on the way. I probably wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to see though.",
          "I am from Barcelona and this is avery interesting place. Specially wheb there are exhibitions Also very close to Ciutadella park. Recommended",
          "The Arc de Triomf on Companya is a nice stop or pass-through while heading to the museums. There is a little playground for kids just facing the Arch, which leads to the large, paved park. The pedestrian walkways are concrete, so strollers can roll easily. The tree-lined park",
          "This fantastic work of art is a beautiful sight in the middle of Barcelona. A place where artists meet to entertain tourists.",
          "It\u2019s a must visit when in Barcelona, just next to the subway station, the weather is fabulous during October and it overlooks a small park (park de la Ciutadella) A Great location for a morning jog.",
          "Nice sight to see and a decent park - conveniently located, not to far from the Sagrada Familia. Not a top tier need to see sight if you've got very limited time but I think it's nice to pop by different parks when you visit a city. It's free and a nice way to take a break and",
          "An interesting monument to see and worth visiting for some lovely photos and a nice area to also sit down in the shade when it gets too hot.",
          "A very nice monument. We visited the Arc in Barcelona during our visit to the Picasso Museum. The Arc is a short walk from the museum and is easy to get to. While the Arc de Triomf is beautiful, you cannot climb or view the monument from the top as with the Arc de Triumph in",
          "Having spent some time in the nearby park we exited across the road and were confronted by the Arc, with a wide boulevard leading through and very ornate lighting structures flanking either side. Good photo stop and picturesque area.",
          "Lovely avenue dominated by the arc. Very open area where lots of people meet and commence various Segway/bike tours or just chill. Avenue leads down to the park so it was a good reference point for us. If you are walking to the park, go via this monument for a nice photo",
          "If you are nearby, stop to check out the Arc, it is an attractive structure. I would not, however, call it a must see attraction in Barcelona.",
          "If you are staying in Barcelona and want somewhere for an enjoyable evening stroll where you are not going to be hassled by street hawkers then this is the ideal place. Leads into the park at one end so ideal for a nice walk and there is often street entertainment along the way.",
          "After touring the Gothic Quarter, this beautiful monument and park offer a welcome break where locals take their afternoon siestas.",
          "not to be missed as its quite underestimated monument, can be done after la sagrada familia as its pretty near to it or can be reached by bus or metro",
          "Went here today with my husband it was a bit of a walk but well worth going to. It\u2019s stunning looks really Mediterranean with the red brick and the statues carved on it. Well worth going to it\u2019s a nice park to walk through too.",
          "Do not miss this attraction! Its architecture is of a unique beauty! You can take a lot of memorable pictures and sit in the surrounding area to admire a unique feature of the magic city of Barcelona!",
          "Made a detour here after our visit to Sagrada Familia en-route to the beach. It shouldn't be compared to the one in Paris but admired for what it is, that is, a grand structure in an area that is not a chaotic and can be appreciated at leisure. It is within walking distance of",
          "Another popular spot for pickpockets and a bit out of the way by metro (L1: Arc de Triomf). Museu de Xocolate and Museu Picasso are located nearby. Park at the other end of the monument is worth seeing. Zoo is located at the far end of the park.",
          "This is a historic door between old and modern Barcelona. If you have enough time to visit, you can go.",
          "Great spot as a centre area to meet, hangout and people watch. There is also a segway tour right outside this spot that you should take.",
          "We walked from our hotel to see the arc, it is a pretty site and the detail on the arc is very nice. With all that u can do in Barcelona, if you don\u2019t have the time u can skip this one.",
          "Nice area to walk through, admire and take some nice photographs, out hotel wasn't too far so we have been past a few times and it's always a nice landmark to see",
          "The Arc de Triomf is large and elaborately decorated. A beautiful attraction for tourists, located opposite a metro station and on a large pedestrain area, giving a chance to admire the arc up close!",
          "The arc de trio for is lovely to see. There\u2019s people selling thing as you walk up towards the park. It\u2019s also very easy to get to on the metro.",
          "The triumphal arch of Barcelona is like a grand entrance to the great city. With a warm red colour, it leads to the major urban park. Very good place for photos.",
          "This triumphal arch was the main access gate to the 1888 World's Fair. We stopped there to walk the promenade and take pictures. Beautiful area.",
          "The park is pleasant and not special and the Arch is significant like most memorials in Barcelona and the walkways wide and clean and interesting but there are better places in Barcelona.",
          "This monument, located on Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys was the entry to the 1888 Universal Exhibition held in Parc de la Ciutadella. Built primarily in brick, it was constructed by the City as a mark of respect to the countries that were participating in the Exhibition. At the top",
          "I liked walking in this area. It was very nice. The sun was setting down which made for nice pictures.",
          "Nice short walk from Arc de Triomf to Parc de la Ciutadella. There are seating areas nearby the pathway and most people tend to take a quick picture of this structure before moving on.",
          "Really beautiful architecture worth stopping for some pictures and a stroll through the park, Worth a visit when in Barcelona.",
          "The nice thing about seeing the Arc de Triomf on a rainy day is that there was a nice reflection on the Arc onto the pavement.",
          "This is a huge gate near the Park de la Ciutadella. Take a photo or two, and that's about it. There was a Thai market there on the day we visited",
          "I didnt know there was an arc of Triomf in Barcelona, but I have to say this one is prettier than the one in Paris. I really liked it. There's nothing around the area, but our hotel was nearby that is why we stopped here. But is was completely worth it.",
          "My SO & I are staying near the Arc and make a point to pass underneath on our way out everyday. It's a really impressive structure that's very detailed when you get up close to examine it.",
          "I think I expected more of the surrounding area. There were a lot of tents obstructing the walkway so maybe that's the main reason for the 3 stars. Sadly, it does not compete with Paris. However, I'm having a wonderful time in Barcelona.",
          "This beautiful arch is located slightly east of the city center. The gorgeous, red brick used in its construction make a great contrast to the vibrant blue Spanish skies. It opens up into a city park with a center walkway that makes for a pleasant stroll.",
          "Though always crowded, day or night, this is a necessary visit when in Barcelona. Take the picture, look around and hear the most diverse languages!",
          "The Arc de Triomf is the entry for Ciutadella park. The arch itself is a good spot to take a few pictures and enjoy the park atmosphere. No reason to spend a few more than a few minutes, but walk from here towards Cascada Monumental is a great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Ok, so it isn\u2019t Paris. But quiet frankly with its picturesque locale and sunnier weather I felt I preferred Barcelona\u2019s Arc De Triomf hell of a lot more with a lovely walk up to the monument itself with sellers either side of you it\u2019s a good way to spend a couple of hours before",
          "I came upon this by chance when looking at Google Maps and decided to take a short walk to see how it compared to the one in Paris. Hadn't seen any pictures before and was surprised to find it was constructed of reddish bricks. Despite this it is a very fine structure and well",
          "Well a tourist spot. Take a guided tour for it. Nothing great about this place, few pics and that\u2019s it.",
          "Nothing special. Could easily take it or leave it. Maybe go after you've done everything else, or probably just don't go at all. You won't miss anything.",
          "This is an amazing monument and in a very picterques area. The arc itself is beautiful and leads right into the park. I would recommend you take this sight in on a day that is more leisurely so that you can simply enjoy the architecture and then relax with a cafecito in the park.",
          "We were there Easter weekend and we were lucky it was a beautiful day. Though it was busy it was nice to stroll along and also sit and people watch. There were street performers and musicians so it was festive and interesting.",
          "Gorgeous area with the arches and long paths. Good for walking. Also there are Segway tours that go through here if you want to see more. It\u2019s pretty close to lots of other areas and fairly central.",
          "This is the start of the beautiful Parc de le Ciutadella, which houses the zoo and the parliamentary building, there is plenty going on here, performers as you are walking down from the Arc de Triomf, a beautiful water fountain which was under renovation when I was there, but",
          "A massive brick archway erected for a World Expo in 1888. It is very impressive to see and in very good shape",
          "This Arc de Triomf might even be prettier than the one in France, it's more colourful. The surrounding area is also nice to walk in on a sunny day. There is some street artists, soap bubbles and acrobats to look at. Close by is the Castell dels tres dragons and parc de la",
          "A lovely evening/ sunset walk! Better than the one in France! A great photo stop and easy to get to.",
          "An amazing monument and very easy to find with helpful people around to navigate. Weather was summer and was very hot but very enjoyable.",
          "a nice place to come and see for free great architecture to see easy to get to as its right outside the metro station",

          "If you are into Cool architecture designs, detailed work, and an overall cool areas to stroll through, don't miss this while visiting Barcelona. I had a list of things I wanted to see while visiting, and this made the list. It's a grand site to see in person. It's a cool feeling",
          "We happened upon the Arc de Triomf as we emerged from a side street as we walked from Las Ramblas to Segrada Famillia. It is of similar size to its cousin in Paris and in ways more intricate and architecturally impressive due to its fine detail. We were under time pressure so",
          "This archway stands out as you approach it, looks fantastic and while different to the ones in Paris, still has its own beauty and grandeur. The boulevarde as you walk up towards it has a fantastic feeling, people with smiling faces and excitement as they see the archway,",
          "We walked by here , so we stopped for a visit. There is not much of it besides the big arch door. If you miss it, you are not missing anything.",
          "I believe this arch was built as the main access gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. I found the structure to be quite plain and in an area of Barcelona that wasn\u2019t particularly exciting. As we had walked a considerable distance to see the Arc, we decided we may as well",
          "It was built un 19th century to commemorate some colonial Spanish victories in North Africa. Plain, built with bricks and in an area with nothing more to see or visit. Don't waste your time here.",
          "Very nice sight to walk around and have great pictures! You can start with the arc and then continue to Parc de la Cuitadella, which make it great combination!",
          "Had been here previously with my eldest but was lucky enough to come back with my youngest. Such a friendly area. Managed several photos and took photos for other passers by too. Love the architecture of the area. Daughter loved it here.",
          "It was well kept, clean and tidy. Nice for sunday walk and a bit further behind you fid Ciutadella park which is great place for sunday chilling. Worth the visit for sure.",
          "Having visited the arc a couple of years ago, we enjoyed the current visit a bit more, as the entire boulevard and the arc itself looked much nicer in the lite rain. It's still not overwhelmingly exciting, but still - worth a visit.",
          "Built during 1888 for the Exposition trade fair , that took place in Barcelona, this beautiful classical architectural monument stand today as the iconic landmarks of Barcelona, built on par with the design of Paris Arc De Triumpe, this intricate designed monument is built with",
          "We walked around here on a nice sunny day in January. Lots of people and buskers to watch. Lots of places to sit and enjoy the sunshine.",
          "I didn\u2019t expect it so big, it\u2019s very imposant, and has a interesting history. We were there when it was raining so there wasn\u2019t a lot of people.",
          "The area around the Arc de Triomf is great for a walk at any time of the day and evening. It is usually busy with locals and tourists but is spacious so not oppressive. It is a place where people can enjoy themselves, sit, stroll and talk in a relaxed area surrounded by",
          "It has a big pedestrian only area right behind the arc which is bigger than that in Paris for instance. So much of musical and stunt activities are constantly being performed here. Within a short walk is Park Ciutedella where you could also have a stroll.",
          "very beautiful palce in Barcelona, lots of turists, close tu city centre, nice place for beautiful pictures ;) \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\u2728",
          "The arch is beautiful and unique. The walking area is great and the area around also has many beautiful buildings. We walked both during the day and in the evening and it was a people place both times.",
          "As with most tourist attractions, the earlier you get their the less people will be around and you can get great pictures.",
          "Big arch and the adjacent pedestrian boulevard is a great place to relax, walk or just photograph. The benches are also light posts with a unique design you don't see much of any place else. Very picturesque.",
          "The nice thing about Barcelona is that because the streets are laid out like a Grid you can soon get your bearing if you get lost, and the Arc is a good land mark close to the Bus station and Metro",
          "For those that have been to any country in Europe, for the most part you will come across some amazing architecture, Barcelona is no different. The Arc de Triomf is an amazing type of structure that just is mind blowing. With the Arc being one of Barcelona's may busy tourist",
          "Beautiful public space. Lots of dogs, people taking photos, laying on the grass, running. A general sense of peace. Can spend about 2 hours here. Make sure to tip performers if you like their show.",

          "We were out walking all day and came upon the arch just by chance. It sure gives a powerful message when you first spot it in all it\u2019s glory. A great brick construction with some adornment on it . A coat of arms and bats. Would have been good if there was some English detail",
          "Walking down Passeig Picasso after visiting the El Born area, we same upon Arc de Triomf which is imposing and impressive. There are lovely palm trees lining both sides and street vendors plying their trade. Well worth a visit and an easy walk from the Park.",
          "In the busy center of Barcelona stands the Arc de Triomf. From park de la Ciutadella begins a long pedestrian street that leads all the way to Arc de Triomf. It is surrounded with tall palm trees and it's a nice place to walk and escape reality for a while.",
          "Love the place. Excellent food choice. Love Tpas and the service received. The area history was very valuable. Love the people and enjoyed sitesees.",
          "We happened to stumble upon the arch while looking for a place to eat and we were pretty blown away. It's an incredible entrance to a serene and beautiful park.",
          "It's a beautiful brick archway at the entrance to Parc de Ciutadella. On it's own, it really is just an arch; a lovely arch, but just an arch nevertheless. But it's at the end of a palm-lined pedestrian avenue with beautiful and ornate lamp posts which leads to one of my",

          "If you are visiting Parc de la Ciutadella then walking by the Arc de Triomf is a nice add-on. The non-local street vendors can be annoying when trying to take photos, although this should not deter a visit.",
          "We walked around the Arc as part of a Viking Ocean cruise excursion. The Arc is like many city Arcs in that it commemorates something important to the city. In this case, it was the main gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. The architect was Joseph Vilaseca Casanovas.",

          "It is cool. Many cities have an arch and this one is quite nice. There is a long passageway and dogs and skater boys abound. Unfortunately there were workers and barricades were around so pictures were kind ruined, but it is nice. Not exciting but quite nice.",
          "The best of it is the way to go to Ciutadella Park, nothing else to add, unless you like to skate with rollerblades.",

          "It is just an arch, but quite an impressive landmark. If you are nearby worth taking a look. We were walking from the Parc de la Ciutadella to Sagrada Familia, so made sure we saw this along the way.",
          "My husband and I walked from the gothic quarter area to the Arc Dr Triomf. So pretty! They have palm trees lining the park area. Beautiful structure.",

          "Right next to the Catalan parliament it\u2019s been the the Center of some very interesting times recently. The arch itself is much smaller than the French equivalent but in its own way it\u2019s much more attractive and approachable. Certainly worth a visit if you come to Barcelona .",
          "It's a good attraction to visit, great place to take some pictures. Also, if you are into cycling, it's a good place to rend bicycles and have a very good ride around the parc and in the gothic quarter.",
          "Although i would not necessary recommend a specific visit to this Arc, it is well worth stopping by if on the way to one of the nearby attractions such as the Parc de la Ciutadella. You can only really appreciate this Arc when you are up close or underneath it and i have to",

          "This is a lovely piece of achitectural construction - a very large brick built arch. Well worth a look, but that is all you can do. It's location, however, in a linear park, is great. A bit like the Ramblas without the shops. Beautifully graceful iron-tracery street lights line",
          "We have seen Arc de Triomphe in Paris and this one in Barcelona is breathtaking as well. Really nice place to go and worth to see it.",
          "One of many monuments in Barcelona the Arc de Triomf is simply that, an Arch in the middle of a public green space celebrating some historic event. While I think we can all agree most cities could use more Parks, both the size and the fact that most of the structure was blocked",

          "It's a great structure and somewhat of a surprise at the edge of the park, green spaces are always needed in City's- this one isn't the best however - quite dry and arid. The archway isn't a must see but still nice.",

          "After you've been to the Arc de Triumph how could any measure up. It's true it's not. But it is very good. Absolutely beautiful and connected to a great place to walk. If there's a holiday while you're there chances are there will be something going on here",
          "We visited the arc for the first time on a bike tour but revised numerous times during our week stay. It is a great area for relaxing and listening/watching the various entertainers that set up here. We enjoyed a few hours reading and relaxing here.",

          "I was looking for a destination to max out my multi-trip metrocard; this now becomes a recommended place. The structure itself is impressive with some quite ornate decoration but it is the setting that makes it so impressive. The walk down Lluls Companys is so relaxed a wide",
          "There is a metro station with the same name on L1. There is another park that you can see and spend some time there. There is not a lot of shade so you may visit it in late afternoon or early morning.",
          "This was lovely to see as we have seen it's sister Arc de Triomphe in Paris. What a lovely walk down the promenade with all the palm trees. Lovely fountains around and once you get here it really is near all the other tourist landmarks!",

          "Entering the Arc de Triomf from the north takes you down the tree lined parade with some lovely architecture on the left side, sit and enjoy people watching and the obligatory ice cream. The Arc itself is a great bit of architecture. Continue your walk to the park",
          "A beautiful part of town that is well maintained and has seating dotted around to rest your weary feet and enjoy an ice cream. Carry on down the park and you join another more lush park to enjoy. Keep an eye out for the parakeets flying around :-)",
          "This 30 metre high red brick arch was built for the 1888 Barcelona world fair. It has a stone sculpture in Catalan (the Spanish language used in Barcelona) that translates as \"Barcelona welcomes the nations\". This is a nice welcome for the many tourists visiting. It is stunning",

          "The Arc de Triomf was beautiful to see in an area that was very calm. When walking down the park that exists adjacent to the Arc, there are a lot of people selling blankets, hats and sunglasses. The park has plenty of seating areas and grass to lie on. It is easily accessible",
          "This is a startling arch in between some wide avenues, it seems a bit out of place where it is and fits in well with Barcelona's habit of housing things that don't really fit in!",
          "I didn't know much about it, turns out it was built for the 1888 World Fair, seems some what unimpressive now... Looks good though, great photo opportunity.",
          "The Arc are the area around it are certainly worth a visit. Nice vibrant park that is easy to access.",

          "This entire Area is a very clean, active, and beautiful park. There are always family's having picnics and the occasional street performer. With a few hidden gem restaurants hidden in the surrounding area its the perfect spot for a pre-dinner stroll.",
          "This passage between the parc and the Arc is a very nice place to walk and chill. Always people around and attractions.",
          "This arch really captures Barcelona\u00a1s attitude to its imperialist past, they just turn it into a fun thing! Where other cities showcase their arches as places that celebrate their glorious history, Barcelona's arch is a more laid-back brick-red color, and is the gateway to a",
          "An arc of triumph is something you should always experience, if a city has one. I hadn't really expected this one to be that great, but we found ourselves sitting for quite a while in silence, studying the details of this landmark. It's near the zoo and parc de la Ciutadella,",
          "Although the walk needs flowers, gardening and maintenance is a pleasant place to walk and rest for a hot day in Barcelona",
          "Was built in 1888 as the entrance to an exhibition in Parc de la Ciutadella, is a good photo opportunity and you can walk through the Arch into the park to the zoological park and the waterfront, there are plenty of other sights situated within walking distance to the Arch.",

          "The arc isn't the biggest I've seen, but still very impressive. It is located in a park where locals seem to congregate later in the day and just kinda chill out. Very nice atmosphere, worth checking out.",
          "Very pretty arch in the middle of Barcelona. There's a nice walk that leads up to it that includes palm trees.",
          "Interesting architecture. Formidable arch. Nice stop on a tour of the city. This was just. Short walk from other major attractions and the subway station.",
          "If you are in Barcelona, I highly recommend making a stop here (maybe not as your first stop, but definitely as a stop) - especially if you consider yourself a photographer and/or have an eye for good pictures. The lighting is great and the view is great. Also, it isn't as",

          "This is a great place for a photograph and selfie. It oftentimes has entertainment as well. For example, we went just after 2am and there was a live band and a large crowd listening. The band was actually very good. We went during the early evening the next day and saw street",

          "We walked through the Arc on the way to the Parc de la Ciutadella on the way to the beach area. It was such an impressive structure and I loved reading about the construction in my guide book. It is worth the walk over for sure.",

          "We went to Barcelona on a day trip and we visited the Arc dr Triomf. It was quite busy but that's to be expected. It was a beautiful piece of architecture to see. As we walked under the arc and along the other side towards the park there were some flamenco dancers which was",
          "The grand walk and park. Enjoyed by tourists(less tourists than Las Ramblas) and locals. Gives the feel of dignified cosmopolitan living. Give yourself time to wonder gracefully!!",
          "Located at the beginning of a walking mall that leads to the park; full of people who are either playing games or working out. Worth the walk ...",
          "This is the largest Arc we have come across in Spain and the place has many tourists around . You can walk there and it has a great Avenue behind it",
          "The Arc de Triomf was built for the world exposition in the late 1800's. Looking through the Arc one sees unbelievable park areas, incredibly beautiful lamps lighting the area, kids and families strolling, skate boaters, musicians, vendors, couples holding hands,",

          "The Arc de Triomf marks the entrance to the site of a previous World Fair, for which this monument was specifically built for. We toured around the area on a bike tour (highly recommended) but walked around the park afterwards, which was very enjoyable. I'd recommend stopping to",
          "Even though the statue is impressive, there is a lovely park behind it which is well worth a wander for a few hours especially if the weather is nice. There are often street entertainers and stalls to browse here too.",
          "I walked through it every day and still couldn't get bored of it. It's way smaller than Paris Arc de Triomphe, but still really beautiful because of the gothic style. From there you can easily reach Parc de Ciutadella and Placa de Catalunya.",
          "This building is simply magnificent. The metro station is just over the road. There is a walkway trailing from the arc, which leads to a fabulous park, housing sculptures, municipal buildings and the most ornate fountain I've ever seen. You can eat and drink outside here too. A",
          "The arch was constructed as the entrance for the Barcelona World Fair in the late 19th century and stands at the entrance to the Ciutadella Park. It is built of red-brick in the Moorish style and consists of a single arch topped by friezes and statues. On the front is a frieze",
          "Worth checking out and with different designs from other arcs, it was located in an extension of the park de la Cuitadella with some amazing light fixtures on the sides. The angels and crowns on top of the Arco were beautiful.",
          "lots of bubble blowing entertainers cyclists and informal events on with lots of reasonable priced cafes around to watch it from",

          "Just a part of history to see if you are visiting the Parc de la Ciutadella. Nice wide walkway to stroll down.",
          "This is a nice landmark of Barcelona comparable to similar arch all other the world, celebrating similar subjects. If you've seen arches in Paris, Delhi, Vientiane, Rome etc, this isn't much different. The main thing that makes it stand out is is the red bricks. Another nice",
          "Walked this avenue while seeing Barcelona. Wide open area with vendors and street performers. Did not seem as crowded as other area. Nice for a change.",
          "Walked here after the Sagrada Familia which took about 20 minutes. A couple of nice cafes on the way. Very unique Catalonian architecture and leads down to the zoo and Gothic Quarter.",
          "The place is fantastic, the architecture is great but nothing special from any other Arc although definitely worth the visit.",
          "We happened to go on a Saturday and there was a very large market with food and arts and crafts going on. The Arc was built with red bricks in the late 1800's and is much different that the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This is worth a stop if you have some extra time. I don't",

          "we visited there just to see the Arc and was surprise to see lots of market stalls and entertainers -really enjoyable and better than les Rambles",
          "We seen this on the sightseeing bus. The park beyond has tree lined path ways. Artistes and paces to sit and enjoy the peaceful ness.",
          "Barcelona hosted the Universal Exhibition in 1888 and constructed the Arc de Triomf as a gateway to the fair. It was constructed by architect Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas. It took us about 20 minutes walk to reach this Arc from the Cruise Terminal. This monument is about 30",
          "We got there while walking in the old city. Massive and beautiful and it deserves a visit. The park around it takes you to the zoo",
          "For repeat visitors to Barcelona this is a nice place to visit. Lots of quite spots. Frequently has outdoor events. Much to see or just to sit and people watch.",
          "This Arc is similiar to the ones I have seen in France. However, it has brick red color. It is also a great landmark that lead me to Parc de la Ciutadella, which is one of the reasons I made it our first site in Barcelona. The site is easy to reach by Metro (L1). I found",
          "This one has more pondus then the Paris one in my opinion. Relaxed atmosphere in the long lane behind. And even pleasant street artists.",
          "Just like the Arc in Paris, this one has its own place in history. Its worth reading about it in a book or getting a guide. If you are a true traveler, you should have a picture of this one along side the other Arcs around the world.",
          "I have a tough time seeing this place as a special landmark or a tourist attraction, this is just a place you pass by when enjoying Barcelona.",
          "See it. Walk under it. Enjoy the palm lined walk and all the people that go with that but there are more important sites in Barcelona. Don't miss them for the Arc de Triomf.",
          "Can't say there is much here. Just an arch and a subway station. Worked more as a landmark for me, separateing the neighbourhood my hotel was in from the Gothic area and the park.",
          "Might aswell come and see the arc when around the Gothic quarter or at the parc del la ciutadella. Good for sight seeing.",
          "The arc symbolizes Catalan triumph. Very nice experience for me and my friends accompanying me. Shows how rich history is in Catalonia.",
          "This is a very obvious and helpful landmark if you've stumbled out of the shopping streets or the Gothic Quarter, it's an impressive structure and the boulevard leads to the lovely Parc de la Ciutadella",
          "We loved walking around the Arc each day on our trip. It was always full of street entertainers and the area itself is just beautiful. The long stretch of road that is lined with palm trees is lovely to walk through, the road leads down to the park which is again fantastic to",
          "The arc is part of a long and wide lane. You can make nice trickphotos from the lane with the arc in the back. Ofcourse you can go under the arc. The lane in which the arc stands in full of street artists, skate boarders and hippies. Its a gathering of people of all sorts of",
          "We stayed in a few blocks away from the Arc de Triomf for a few weeks, and enjoyed the evenings in the park. With music groups on the weekends, and all sorts of street vendors around, it's just a nice place to sit and watch people. It also serves as a good entry point to Parc",
          "It was an unusual colour as I was expecting it to be white marble! The park behind it was the real jewel.",
          "Not much to report but a nice \"door\" to various districts in Barcelona. Obviously to be seen even from a distance !",
          "Great place to take pictures, walk down the tree lined avenue to a park which is lovely for pictures. You don't need to spend a lot of time here but very pretty.",
          "Check this site out, it's pretty dope, has lots of nice places to eat around it & is centred near the famous parc de la cuidatella (or something like that) which is super awesome!",
          "We started our segway tour at the arc de triomf. It was nice and red. A copy of the Parisian one but not so high and not so majestic. A very nice monument though.",
          "As our guidebooks have noted, there is not a whole lot of military triumph in Catalunya to warrant an arch, but it is pretty enough. We went at night and thought it was beautifully lit. Worth seeing if you are that way, but you will not miss out on the essential Barcelona",
          "Nice atmosphere, beautiful place to visit and take pictures, specially when the weather is good. would recommend.",
          "Great place to spend a couple of hours here and in the Park next door in the hot sunny weather. Take a picnic and have a sit out and watch the world go by. Great place of kicking back and people watching.",
          "Enjoyed walking by this arc on our way around the city. It's as pictured, along a large walkway. Beautiful to photograph, definitely worth a look!",
          "This attractive arch leads on to an avenue, which we didn't have time to walk down as this was a quick detour stop on route to other sites. But definitely worth 10 minutes or so of your time for a photostop!",
          "At first - it's for free, second - it's verry nice area - green area for take time out anbd lelax. Take caffee, some croissant, go at morning and just breathing clear weather.",
          "There are many arhes that are built to commemorate past victories worldwide but this on is the best one I have ever seen, it is better than the one in Paris. In Rome there are arches that are very old with historic value but this one is really very nice looking especially the",
          "It was a nice visit and to take a picture of, but nothing truly grand. I personally enjoy Paris' much more. Funny that this was built instead of the Eiffel Tower (oops).",
          "Stumbled across the arc on the way home from the other sites. Very pretty and well worth a photo. We didn't walk down the avenue but still nice to see.",
          "A landmark that you drop by and see within 10 minutes. It's pretty cool but the Cascada Monumental inside the park is way cooler.",
          "This is great architecture and surrounding spaces. and helpful when trying to figure out where you are. Get out and have a look and walk around.",
          "The Arc de Triomf is a triumphal arch, similar to the one in Paris, Rome, Bucaharest. It was built as the main access gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. The arch crosses over the wide central promenade of the Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys, leading to the Ciutadella Park via a",
          "Thieves are watching you! Ok. The place is beautiful. BUT BEWARE! OPEN YOUR EYES AND HOLD YOUR STUFF. I am not kidding. My backpack and my camera - an expensive camera - was taken from me. I am the kind of person that have different lenses to take pictures. So, inside my bag",
          "Whilst perhaps not quite as impressive as the French version, it is certainly a nice way to enter Parc de la Cuitadella, and a gentle stroll away from the city crowds. A nice photo opportunity and would recommend to see.",
          "It's a nice version of the Arc de Triomf (as is the one in Rome). It is set out on a nice street with plenty of benches either side. There is also Parc de la Ciutadella not too far away. The parc is def worth a visit. The Arc has nice features and is easily seen from a fair",
          "We spent far longer here than we planed because the park offered a peaceful respite from the busy day of touring.",
          "A monument perhaps but actually surprisingly beautiful and surrounded by a large street with benches. One could easily sit in this park!",
          "So although this is not the original Arc de Triomf it is still very cool to see. It was a convenient walk from our hotel. There were a lot of people enjoying the park that it opens up to and the street entertainers. It was a very beautiful and enjoyable attraction.",
          "Another Arch de Triumph, but another city - great construction and similar to the others. Quite an attractive arch and easily seen from a distance.",
          "Just up the road from Parc de la Ciutadella, this attraction is a good spot for pictures. It is a 1 minute walk from the metro station and there is a nice souvenir ahop just next door to the station. Features a nice scenic walk which our toddler enjoyed. There was a man making",
          "Nice walk during the summer time and activities around the Arc, seen kids playing, training on for the skaters and lots many more. A nice park close by makes it a nice spot to visit during your trip here.",
          "Stumbled across it by accident, having meant to visit at some point. The walk up was great - a lovely atmosphere with buskers and street entertainers. Lots of benches and places to sit and just take it all in.",
          "It is very pretty, but I have seen several of these in our International travels, and honestly, they are almost all the same. I promise, that if you are walking around Barcelona, you will probably happen upon it. I would just recommend planning to see when you have a nearby",
          "Very impressive architecture, well worth a visit. Plenty of opportunity to take some photos and a lovely walk down the middle.",
          "We walked from Las Ramblas which took us approximately 40 minutes strolling along. An impressive building, as well being a great place to people watch. There is a long stretch of promenade which a variety of activities take place by passersby such as uni cycling, skateboarding,",
          "A very impressive piece of architecture.Popular place with locals as well as us tourists.Walk on into the park and the zoo is at the bottom.A couple of nice fountains and a very pleasant place for a relax.Can get very busy.",
          "Very beautiful - go there! It's must seen in Barcelona! Really nice part of the city, The ZOO is near.",
          "Well worth a visit. This giant arc du triomf is very easy to find and beautiful. On the pathway at the back of the arc there are street performers, skaters, musicians and locals relaxing, it's a very popular spot and I can well recommend stopping here to relax with an ice cream",
          "It's definitely worth seeing. There is a very nice, large park there as well. Seemed to be a good central meeting spot. Also a lot to do and see nearby including good restaurants.",
          "As we saw one in Rome, one in Paris, it was obvious to see this one also. It says so many about the history, and the differences between cultures, architecture styles. We've loved it so much.",
          "The Arc de Triompf is massive. The placa is a good place to sit, some street performances here in the day, skaters, the locals like to sit here for shelter from the sun among the trees. The street from Placa de catalunya towards Arc de Triompf is dimly lit in the evenings but",
          "Great spot for strolling around or just sitting down for a short break, full with locals doing their daily routines, doing sports or just chatting with each other. Beautiful Arc and if you are already there walk down on the main street, you will see a new modern neighbourhood in",
          "We went out exploring and found Acr de Triomf. It lead you into a nice park where our children could run around and enjoy the scenery. Beautiful architecture and lots of detail. Because of the history I would say go see it! But if you are looking for something breathtaking,",
          "The Spanish Arc is nice but not spectacular. Situated on a wide walking boulevard, it's a pleasant walk & a good photo opportunity.",
          "The huge red brick arc of Arc de Triomf leads you to a lovely relaxing walk through the Parc de la Cuitadella. Which in itself is an oasis of calm in a busy city.",
          "the arc looks pretty cool - you can see beautiful buildings and a tree-lined alley through it...stroll along the alley and you'll get to the Park Cituadella as well as the Zoo",
          "Just a nice walk with a super view. It's good to have some story behind and maybe some guidance, as it is quite a story around.",
          "The name does a disservice for this arch, since it immediately makes you compare it to the much bigger one in Paris. The arch in Barcelona its own greatness.",
          "If you haven't seen an Arc de this is nice. Very interesting the different style than some of the other arc's I've seen. Nice walk to get to it and beautiful park! Worth seeing..",
          "The Arc de Triomf is an impressive arc that invites you to walk beneath it and continue down the promenade towards Parc de la Ciutadella. It is worth a look and then a wander through the park as it is close to the city centre.",
          "Lovely place to visit easy accessible nice photo opportunity and great place to take in the local culture.",
          "This is a great place to explore starting here admiring the arc and walking down to the park, and towards the zoo. It's right near the metro and there are many restaurants and other streets to explore and see more of Barcelona's culture. Definitely recommend this to anyone",
          "This is and impressive monument! Same shape as Paris not quite as big but impressive none the less worth a look after you've been in the park which is just south of the arc!",
          "Red brick built Arc in a nice park area. Not as imposing as some, the ones in Paris and London come to mind. But it's imposing in its own way. Worth a view if you are at that side of town.",
          "it's an arch. Kind of plain compared to a lot of city arches, but if you want a decent plaza to go sit at, why not.",
          "It is worth to see and have a walk here, explore also this part of history of Barcelona. Perhaps you can then also walk further to the Zoo.",
          "We ate breakfast in the park one morning and it was a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the sun. There were a lot of people out and about and is a nice place to people watch. The Arc is the entranceway to the park and and is a nicely placed landmark. It's a nice place to spend",
          "A great structure with magnificent feel. Not really much else but a monument. By the metro station and a short walk from the beautiful park and the zoo.",
          "Gorgeous gate of the city. It is the begining of the nice park. Also there is a stand on the ground sometimes which you can find cheap,nice gifts like magnets for 1-1.5 euros.",
          "That's 3 Arc de Triomf's Ive seen now haha . Its on a Lovely road with palm trees and Amazing park behind it don't miss it !!",
          "I was happy to see the magnificent Arc de Triomf at Barcelona on a recent visit to the city. During my stay I spent an entire day on foot exploring the city and also spent time here - learnt that it was built in 1888 and like the Arcs in several cities (I've seen the one in",
          "I have walked in this area a few times. On a sunny day it's a nice walk, not too crowded. And not too many sales men trying to sell fake shoes and cheap stuff..",
          "The title says it all. Impressive structure, visited with my girlfriend at the weekend and had a blast. And the sun even came out for us. A must visit!!",
          "Doesn't look that good, has no meaning in terms of an arc de triomf, and to think the turned down the Eiffel Tower for this! Gardens and large walking area in front of it are nice",
          "The Arc de Triomf is a great place to visit in the day or in the evening for a slow walk. The metro brings you right outside and it's always bustling with people and tourists. Check it out!",
          "This area becomes so nice at night with locals and day with tourists, just a really nice cool place to walk and with parks and shade nearby",
          "Got here by the metro, you come out right in front not, great to see and its beautiful in the day, and at sun set. local people seem to gather here of an evening to, do different activities like, roller skating and street arts. beautiful if you want to sit and have chill session.",
          "We were surprised to come round the corner & see this! Great for early morning pictures & popular as a meeting point for tours, this would make a good walk from the Barceloneta area. There is also a lovely park close by. This is worth the trek if you have time",
          "Well, I feel there is a Triomf in every big city, and this one did not disappoint! Great architecture and a great place!",
          "This place is a stunning piece of work. You come out of the metro and it just hits you. We had a sunny day so against the blue sky it looked fantastic. Take a stroll right down to the Park at the other end of the walkway.",
          "Near the City Park and the Gothic Quarter, the arch is a nice waypoint. Mostly it's something to get a picture of and walk by while people-watching. Lots of street performers tend to gather here too. It's near a metro stop and several cafes too.",
          "Having just seen the Arc de Triomphe in Paris just two days ago, this arch was literally a mini version of it, which I actually thought was pretty neat. The difference lies, though, in that this arch is more of just a landmark and not something that you can really interact with",
          "Very nice monument in the heart of BCN. The Arc stands in a very nice location, a fine alley and a touristic area. You can take some really good shots for this monument from across the street. Once done, pass under it and enjoy the 1km (or so) alley where street artists perform.",
          "I would recommend this area for a great walk that isn't as crowded as Barceloneta or Las Ramblas and if you want to go somewhere a little quieter.",
          "This is a picture-perfect spot. It's fairly easy to get to and has the metro located right across the street. You can strolls around the area or just people-watch.",
          "Original entry from 1888. Stroll under and down and back on the mall. Put it on your walking tour. Note the ceramic design.",
          "Nice Arc but nothing spectacular IMO, go there is if have some time on your hands, there is also a park behind the arc.",
          "Saw it from the car, it's big and very nice. But it's an arch, don't go out of your way to see it. It's cool at most",
          "Fine arch being a remnant of all those fabulous buildings that were erected during the era av Grand Expositions all over the Western world in those golden (for some) days. A great-grand parents nostalgic trip, if they were still alive.",
          "Very clean and lovely area with the exception that you do need to keep and eye out for Dog droppings. Lots of Couples and Families out for an easy stroll. Vendors around the area and places to get a quick beverage or snack.",
          "A beautiful arch and the surrounding area will interest tourists with street performers, street sellers, and a good area to people- watch with tourists and locals walking around the area. If we were based near the location, we would have spent some time here; as we were based",
          "Attractive pedestrian area. The Arc de Triomf is quite impressive. If coming here it is wort to visit the ZOO which is not far away.",
          "I walked through here with a new friend and we had a lovely time! Would definitely recommend for a nice stroll through the park and surrounding area!",
          "It seems like all Barcelona people wants this to be erased from history. There is no plague to describe how this monument came about. It resemble the Arc De Triumph in Paris.",
          "A great piece of architecture just outside the zoo. It's at the end of a long pedestrianised boulevard and the impressive red brick is a visual treat. It's only a short walk from Placa de Catalunya. As such it is well worth a visit.",
          "We found it a great place for a walk, the Arc looks impressive and there is beatuful alley with the palm trees. Also a big parc is very close, so its perfect place for a nice sunny day. Would definitely recommend it.",
          "There is a huge pedestrian area where you can walk around in peace taking pictures of the Arc de Triomf. It is also in a very nice area where you can adventure around, and if you are really up for it there is even a bike rental place next to it so you can enjoy Barcelona in a",
          "There is a nice pedestrian area here, where you can admire the Arc and then stroll down and enjoy the local feel. It is worth checking out if you are in the area.",
          "The street along Arc de Triomf is very nice for having some outdoor activities (pet walk, sport or just a walk). Leads to Parc Ciutadella which is also very pleasant place for relax.",
          "Beautiful and grand structure that sits at the end of a walking plaza/street. Fun to walk along and watch the locals and tourists alike.",
          "Cool enough, nothing compared to the one in paris, but in a neat walking area. Good area to chill and people watch.",
          "This is simmillar as arc triomf at other cities.But it is near port and near zoo .It is good to see it",
          "A peaceful place for a stroll. Impressive site, but obviously not as amazing as the one in Paris. If you are in the neighborhood, I'd stop by to see it.",
          "The Arc itself is not so exciting. It's small and you can't enter the building. But the area in front of it is full of life. You can see here many locals and tourists wandering and enjoying their lives.",
          "It is not as big as the one in Paris but it is impressive in it's own right. I enjoyed photographing this imposing structure and walking around it to admire beautiful shape and form.",
          "It may not be top of the list of things to see in Barcelona, especially compared to the glory of all things Gaudi, but it's still pleasing to the eye and impressive. The area around it is pleasant to walk around so it's a good stopping off point if you're exploring",
          "My wife thought I was joking when I said we should go to see the Arc de Triomf! Obviously not the Paris one!! It's a bizarre architecture with mixed materials, including red brick by the look of it. Worth a visit and there's a pleasant pedestrianised area to mooch about in. When",
          "The Arc de Triomf was interesting with lots of tourist walking down the pathway. There were a fews tree performers also on the pathway entertaining the people. Interesting but not the highlight of my trip to Barcelona",
          "It seem like there was a lot of activity here street performers, hang out areas for teenagers, as well as locals spending time with their pets. While leaving we noticed they are setting up for an event it seems like this area is very popular to tourist as well as the locals.",
          "The area around the Arc de Triomf is very nice. Wide open spaces amidst the city, space for walking, cycling, picnicking. I probably wouldn't go looking for it, but it was lovely to find.",
          "Parrots make themselves known as they cry out to one another in a little oasis attached to a lovely section of Barca to investigate on foot. Picasso museum is nearby .its just a fun vibe you get when you visit this area.",
          "We approached the Arc de Triomf from the zoo side of the park. It is an amazing sight with only gets better as you approach. The Arc de Triomf is situated in a fantastic park. There are numerous buildings to see and plenty of seating to relax and take in the fantastic view.",
          "The Arc de Triomf was nice to see but after a few minutes of taking photos, there isn't much else to do. We recommend visiting Parc de la Ciutadella on the same day which is only a few minutes away. This park proved to be a nice place to go for a walk and was a nice change",
          "If you are visiting Barcelona then you must see the Arc de Triomf. It is a very nice landmark to see and it won't cost you a penny.",
          "Its on the way to the sea direction to Ciutadella park. Nice to see, but nothing special about it. Just the check in",
          "Walk along La Gran Via Catalunha to Placa Tetuan from which you can walk to Arc de Triomf and also visit Parc Ciutidella",
          "A reminder of the original one in Paris, the Arc (located just outside the park) is a great area for a nice stroll!",
          "Nice place to rest, there are many benches where you can just sit and chill, nice location, city centre is also close",
          "Every Arc in every city are equally beautiful. Barcelona's Arc is somewhat quieter than that in Paris. There are many caf\u00e9s in which you can dine outside and enjoy the views of the Arc.",
          "The Arc de Triomf of Barcelona is located next to a park. Good for a visit if you want to relax during a sunny day. The building itself is in red bricks and not really exciting. So, not a big deal if you miss it during your stay.",
          "This is a nice photo op to take a picture thru the archway down the plaza. Definitely on the walking tour of Barcelona.",
          "Lots of tourists but its a nice place to walk through. Also near the park, which is also a great place to go.",
          "Enjoyed our stop in the area around the Triumph arch beautiful architecture in a park-like setting great photo opportunities a place to sit and unwind with a cup of coffee and a pastry.",
          "It's a beautiful monument to fit in on a city walk. It is definitely worth to pass by. There is nothing to do, only the monument can be seen from the outside",
          "Visited here one weekend back in May when visiting Barcelona with my partner we'd been to the one in Paris so had to visit this one for a photo opportunity and there's also a nice park to walk through just off it!",
          "A nice place where by night a lot of young people come and play music, dance, sometimes it gets a little crowded",
          "This is situated in a lovely area of the city. The park right before it is lovely. Lots of people on segways touring the city. The is a cool map of barcelons on the pavement at the opposite end of the park.",
          "Built as the gateway to the 1888 Universal Exhibition this pink bricked facade in the Spanish/Moorish Style with sculptures of crafts,industry, and business. These days it welcomes international visitors to the city",
          "Barcelona is such a cosmopolitan city with such grand buildings & monuments to behold. The art & history is magnificent. The old world charm is magical here.",
          "We walked from La Rambla... The Arc itself is magnificent... The park between the Arc and Barcelona Zoo has music halls and a museum...",
          "The Arc de Triomf is an iconic landmark in the Spanish city of Barcelona, it is in easy walking distance from the Plaza Catalunya and is close to the bus station Estation de Nord",
          "This place is not as old as most people believe, but yes it's still good to visit, the walking around also have few perks, the park and a little down the animals! Over all I enjoyed this monument and it's great to see if you come to Barcelona!",
          "Perfect spot to see on foot! This sums up Barcelona! It is easy to see and is the perfect walk to see after a visit to the neighboring park!"

          "One of the best outdoor places to visit in Barcelona. Also probably one of the best places to take some nice photos (calling all the Instagrammers), its also a nice walk if you are pretending to head towards the beach. Here is a nice photo I took a couple months ago there.",
          "Magnificent experience to walk under this Arco De Triunfo.\n\nA beautiful fountain and green garden is awaiting you inside.\n\nIt is definitely one of the must visit spots while in Barcelona.\n\nYou could find a free toallets inside, just next to \u2026",
          "Cool monument in Barcelona surrounded by a nice park. Great place to walk. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go out of my way to see this but if you\u2019re in the area or want to take a minute away from the hustle and bustle in the city, I recommend it.",

          "Beautiful structure. And an lovely walk down the promenade it opens into. It\u2019s not the arch de triumph, but still makes for a nice Instagram shot. Fun street performers in the area",
          "One of my favourite arch. Mainly cause it has as more unique style and does not look so much like the others across Europe. It is one of the not so crowded sightseeings so it is nice to visit it take some pictures or even relax under it. Especially in a sunny day so that you can see the colours better.",
          "Nice full of life and quite clean.  Some birds surround it without disturbing the walkers.  Some photographer promotes photos as before. It is a family and romantic walk.",
          "Beautiful structure, surrounded by street performers. Nice place to walk around with a drink or snack and soak up the vibe. There were singers, dancers, painters, bubble wand-ers, and vendors for things like souvenirs and scarves. Walking to the end of the strip takes you to a beautiful park.",

          "It's better than the paris one!",
          "Was barricaded off, possibly for a show or concert. It is a big brick arch, but nothing overly impressive. Would be cool to see without all the stuff around it. Large square with lots of people hanging out when the weather is nice.",
          "Nice landmark located right in front of the Ciudella Park. Well worth the visit as it's one of the stops for people who are interested in history and architecture. You can take a couple of nice pictures here & visit in a few steps away \u2026",
          "Beautiful, a total must go-to during a visit to Barcelona",

          "Hmmmm... I really want to taste this higher but I'm thinking there are so many monuments like this around Europe is it really more than average? Don't get me wrong, it's really beautiful and well maintained. The ornaments are nicely done \u2026",

          "We were absolutely blown away by the beauty of the site of Arc De Triunfo and Barcelona in general. The walk way past the Arc usually is filled with street artists / performers, surroundings are covered in beautiful flowers and plants. It a must to see whilst visiting Barcelona \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8",

          "Interesting place. There were several street performers and a band playing when I was there. It\u2019s near a nice park and the Catalan Parliament. It\u2019s worth a visit.",
          "Cool place, but the whole area was under construction while we were there.  I bet it's absolutely gorgeous when it's finished. But for now I can only give it a 4   I would definitely recommend seeing it.  Very lovely",

          "A nice to see Barcelona landmark",
          "As far as I'm concerned, and I suspect that many others think the same, the main attraction is not the arch. It's the wonderful big adjacent park. Many locals use the park to cool down on a hot day and to stroll around with friends and family. For a visitor, it would be people watching.",
          "A really nice sight to see if you're exploring barcelona. Nice area to chill out and grab a bite to eat outside. It is a little touristy though, so try to either go early in the morning or later in the evening to miss the crowds (I learned this during the time I took these photos!)",
          "Stunning archway as I was there in January I didn't see the area in its full glory as there was a lot of work being done on the flower beds even still a very pleasant walk along the wide avenue will definitely go back and visit in the height of summer for a different perspective",

          "Really enjoyed sitting on one of the benches and watching the soap bubbles pass by and the excitement of children chasing them.",
          "Quite some street performers that were playing music, was quite lovely. The thing i don't understand is that they are letting bikes on the big central pathway, all these people are walking there with kids and taking pictures. I wouldn't be suprised if one gets scooped up on a wheel.",
          "It\u2019s not only a victory arc but also a spot for many memories made. A lovely sight to behold before a short stroll through the gardens or in the gothic quarters. ;))",

          "Pretty nice place. Must visit if you are in Barcelona!",
          "Beautiful and historical! It was right by our hotel or we may not have chosen this as a spot to see with only two days in Barcelona. But I'm glad we did. In the adjoining park there were musicians, a man making huge bubbles with bubbles \u2026",

        "wiki": "Montju\u00efc Castle (Catalan: Castell de Montju\u00efc, Spanish: Castillo de Montjuich) is an old military fortress, with roots dating back from 1640, built on top of Montju\u00efc hill in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It currently serves as a Barcelona municipal facility. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe foundation stone for the basic fortification was laid out in 1640. A year later, in January 1641, the fort saw its first battle, during the Catalan Revolt when the Principality of Catalonia challenged Spain's authority. On orders from the King of Spain, Pedro Fajardo, heading an army of 26,000 men, proceeded to crush the revolt. The Spanish recaptured several cities, but they were defeated at the Battle of Montju\u00efc by Catalan, led by Francesc de Tamarit.\nFifty years later, in 1694, new bastions and battlements were erected and the fortress became a castle. In the Siege of Barcelona (1705) the fortress was captured by the British 6th Regiment of Foot led by Lt.-Col William Southwell, paving the way for the siege of Barcelona itself. Southwell was afterwards made Governor of the castle.\n\nThe old fort was however demolished in 1751 by the Spanish engineer and architect Juan Martin Cerme\u00f1o, creating the current structure, still standing. The final shape of the castle took form during 1779 and 1799, when major construction works took place in order to improve the castle and accommodate the needs. It was also during this time that the castle was equipped with 120 cannons.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the French Army entered Barcelona, and, on orders from Napoleon, they also captured the castle without firing a shot as the troops guarding the castle were ordered not to fight the French.\n\nIn the last 350 years Montju\u00efc Castle has played a decisive role in the history of Barcelona, becoming a symbol after the Catalan defeat to Spain in 1714, date that has become of significant importance. Since then the Montju\u00efc cannons have bombarded the city and its citizens on various occasions, and Montju\u00efc has been used as a prison and torture centre repeatedly for three centuries.\nThe castle is infamous in Catalan history books because of its role in the civil war from 1936 to 1939 when both sides of the conflict imprisoned, tortured and shot political prisoners at Montju\u00efc, among them Llu\u00eds Companys, who was the president of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War. Companys was executed upon orders from the Spanish State at Montju\u00efc Castle in 1940. \nLater in the 20th century, the castle became a military museum. In June 1963, Francisco Franco inaugurated the Military Armor Museum, the official name given to the institution.\n\n\n== Current status ==\n\nIn April 2007, the government transferred the castle to Barcelona City Council. Following discussions over the next months, the castle became a municipal facility. Subsequently, in 2010 the museum was closed and the City Council started a project of restoration and waterproofing of the roof and a watchtower.\nThe current plans for the castle include L\u2019Espai de la Mem\u00f2ria, El Centre d\u2019Interpretaci\u00f3 de la Muntanya de Montju\u00efc, and cultural activities.\nThe castle can be accessed by the Montju\u00efc cable car, a gondola lift that has its upper station near the castle entrance and connects, via the Montju\u00efc funicular, with the Barcelona Metro at Paral\u00b7lel station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPrototype metre\nMeridional definition\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCastell de Montju\u00efc tourist information\nCastell de Montju\u00efc information\nCastell de Montju\u00efc history",

          "It is up to you how you get there, there are so many options, but if you decide to walk up or down, bear in mind some steep slippery streets. You get a great view of the city and the sea. And what is really impressive is the number of planes landing at El Prat.",

          "There is so much more that could be done to bring some kind of life to this castle with a bit of imagination!! Maybe open the dungeons and add some kind of animation and perhaps charge a little more to the entrance fee. Yes it has great views but so has lots of other places in",

          "Well, maybe not the second best thing to do but behind going to the Sagrada Familia this place needs to be visited. On a clear day, you can see all of this great city and miles into the Mediterranean ocean. Take the cable car and walk down.",
          "Using the hop on/off bus we got off at organe stop number 7 just up from the cable car. Having read how tuff the walk up to the castle was we decided to brave it and give it ago. It is a bit steep but definitely manageable and you get to see the lovely gardens that lead up to",
          "We were not sure what to expect after reading mixed reviews. We really enjoyed our visit. The cable car was pricey but the entrance fee to the castle was reasonable. The video at the start was informative as was the visitors information centre. The staff were helpful and",
          "We went up here in the afternoon. We caught the cable car up which was \u20ac12 each for a return trip. Entry was \u20ac5 each. The grounds were in good shape and the walk around was easy. The castle itself it\u2019s not that interesting with not a great deal of rooms to look in, but you go",
          "Beautiful castle! The flowers were all taken care of. They definitely keep up the grounds well! Great views too!",
          "The castle is rather small and it does not have lot of exhibits. But it has amazing panoramic view of the city and the price is cheap! It is worth visiting!",
          "Amazing views of the City and sea but was very disappointed at how little we learned about the Castel itself. There were only a handful of things to read and from which to learn unfortunately.",
          "The castle is small and don't have lot of exhibits. But it has panoramic view of the city and the price is cheap so if you have time, visit it!",
          "We went up with the cable cart. A short but nice ride. Booking in advance makes it 3 euros cheaper. The castle itself isn't that special, nor is the view on the city. Part is view on the harbour, very industrial. The entrance is 5 euro pp and that's all its worth. The cool and",
          "Stunning location good history and information good and not too overpowering. Kids can roam freely. Combine with Funicular and Teleferic. No discount with Barcelona card but it is not expensive to get in. Plenty more of space so if we had planned ahead better we would have taken",
          "The views are stunning, located at the top of the hill. You can watch the city and locate the main attractions like Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell, Arenas mall and others.From the other side you will have a great view of the port, the beaches and the skyline merging with the sea.",
          "Walked from the city to the Castle, great walk though steep in parts. But well worth it for the absolutely stunning views of Barcelona and beyond. Also great view along the coast in both directions. Great value as well only 5 euro for entry and plenty of information boards",
          "It was a trek to walk from town, but we started our day up at the castle and had amazing views of the entire city. We were able to have lunch up there and then on the walk back to town stopped by the Olympic Arena and Magic Fountain.",
          "Our Barcelona, Spain adventure begins on Montjuic (Jew Mountain), which was a Jewish cemetery from 700-1492 CE. It now has a former military fortress from where people did not return under Franco, a Joan Mir\u00f3 Museum and 1992 Olympic groups. Beautiful city views.",
          "The castle is empty from inside you can just see a panoramic view all over Barcelona and the sea nothing special",
          "This Castle is good for family and kids, and adults as well. This is one of the most sun-lit and bright castles in France. It is not so big you cannot cover the distance. Transport is convenient. There is bus and metro going there. Then you take the lift going up to the castle.",
          "A adult is \u20ac5 to get in, seriously cannot complain at the price. The views are stunning, and others have said there isn\u2019t a huge amount of exhibits but there is clearly a lot of history there. There is a cafe, toilets and some lovely gardens. Would seriously recommend you get",
          "This is worth the 5\u20ac just for the view from the top! I didn\u2019t read any of the information displays, I was only interested in the 360 degree views, they are absolutely stunning. There is a place to grab a drink and a snack while you are there. I got there using the Montjuic cable",
          "Visited Montju\u00efc Castle 18th July 2019 Parked up and continued up hill to the castle. Walked all the way around the grounds to take in the outstanding views. Returned to the car to find the rear quarter window smashed and all our cases and backpacks stolen. On further inspection",
          "I thought it\u2019d be interesting to come here but there wasn\u2019t anything there of much historical interest. The views are ok but I\u2019ve seen better elsewhere in Barcelona. It\u2019s not worth the effort to come here.",
          "I love visiting historical landmarks and trying to imagine the activities that may have occurred. This landmark is just average, honestly not worth the hike up the hill to see it. Take the bus as far up as you can. Bring tons of water and be prepared to wait.",
          "Take the cable car up. It is definitely worth the ride. The view of Barcelona is spectacular. The castle itself is so so, however the views are great. Take the walk back down so you don't miss the gardens. Have a dram of whiskey at the beverage stand.",
          "Easy place to get to, either public transportation or with the cable cars. There's a guided tour provided, but you can go in on your own.",
          "If you want to enjoy the best views overlooking the city and surrounding area this is the place. Take the metro as far as you can go and then either the bus (cheap) or funicular (expensive, some views) up to the castle. Make sure to allow at least an hour or more to wander",
          "A great place to get out of the city for a while. The views are great of the whole city and the air fresh. Get the cable car either up or down.",
          "Stumbled across this today after getting the cable car up. Fabulous views across the port and across the whole of Barcelona. Small entry fee to get in but worth a wander around. Cafe there and toilets too. Unexpected bit of history discovered here.",
          "Montjuic Castle was great to see. Teens loved Fenucular. Be sure to walk down and enjoy a cold beverage or a snack.",
          "The view from the castle is amazing and the castle itself is really good. You can learn about its history and see how it is from inside. The only issue is on how you will get there. Apart from that, it worths a visit.",
          "Walked up in the late afternoon from the Parallel. The view on the city is amazing and the castle itself is quite impressive. I always wanted to visit it because of the history associated with it and finally got to do it. If you find the climbing too difficult there is a cable",
          "If you plan to walk up there be prepared to sweat! It was about 600ft climb to walk up there but the views were amazing. It had some nice historical information but no need for more than a quick visit. We took the gondola down!",
          "The Castell de Montjuic is one of the focal points of Catalan history. Getting to the Castell is either by walking all the way up through Parc de Montjuic, via the local bus, or the Barcelona Bus Turistic. There is a very small entry fee (3 to 5 euros) per person, and they even",
          "almost end of city,great view to port and see. good place for people they like fortification...not so far from Pl. Espanol",
          "Great place to see Barcelona from a high point. Interesting walk up to the Castle. There is not that much to see around the castle but still it's worth coming to.",
          "Montjuic Castle was a fun way to spend a few hours. We actually paid to ride the gondola up to the castle and enjoy the nice stroll through the vast gardens on the way down. My one tip would be to walk down. It takes about 20 minutes but the pictures and the landcape are",
          "The castle is easily accessible from the Cable car station and represents a good investment of your time and a modest entry fee. Perched high above the castle and the sea it is easy to grasp the strategic importance of the castle in defending the city; equally it must have been",
          "Enjoyed our morning looking round this castle. Was a nice suprise after the uphill Walk to get there to find it was only \u20ac3 for us to get in as we were under 30. Would recommend the cable car as we walked and nearly passed out lol!",
          "This place makes for a fantastic afternoon out and there\u2019s so much in the park you could easily spend all day here. My girlfriend and I walked from La Ramblas to the Olympic swimming pool (about 25/30 mins) and got the cable car which starts next to the swimming pool. It takes",
          "On first sunday of the month it is free. It has nice sunset view and a great garden. Worth the climb.",
          "Worth it! Amazing place with wonderful view on the city. We really enjoyed our visit ! I recommand this place!",
          "Interesting place to visit with fantastic views of all of Barcelona. We took the team and walked, it's all up hill but there are buses you can take",
          "Very impressed with the condition of the building and surrounding grounds, it was a great walk on a lovely clear day, could see all of Barcelona city and port, with surrounding mountain ranges too. Cafe for rather busy so service was a bit abrupt, but good food still.",
          "its a nice place to visit, but if you're only coming for a couple of days to Barcelona than don't. you have much more interesting activities that worth seeing other Than this.",
          "We took the Teleferic de Montjuic cable car to/from the castle (10,70\u20ac per person). Then we paid 3,00\u20ac per person to take a self-guided tour of the castle. It is an old military fortress built during the Reapers\u2019 War, in 1640, and has survived to the present day. It offers a",
          "Arrived by Metro L2 to Paral-lel, chose to walk up from there. Lovely day. At Castle, English tour, offered 2X a day, with guide Maria Paz took us to places most tourists miss: water cisterns, dungeon prison cells, top of the fort. Well worth it! Rode public bus #150 down",
          "This is a must-see in Barcelona. If you want amazing, 360 views this is the place to be! However, don't make the mistake of walking there from the park like we did (it takes forever and it's all uphill so we were exhausted by the time we got there), instead take the sky",
          "We did it by walk with family from Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Espanya and it was super choice. U see so much stuff on the way that u would miss by cable car (water fountains, botanical gardens, olympic station, ...) as much time u book as much u can enjoy. Near the top is nice kids playground and",
          "What an unexpectedly fantastic day out! I had initially planned to go here because of its historical relevance and interest for my husband but ended up taking my breath away! The views, the info, and history are very enlightening sad as it may be... We'd taken the teleferic up",
          "Arriving here in the afternoon on a Sunday meant we got in for free which is always welcome. You can wander freely around the fortress and worthwhile to view is a short video which comes up in English and explains some of the history and its role during the civil war. We then",
          "It is nice to see. But you can also get some good high views from the Arena mall down the street when you go to the top. There are some nice restaurants there too. we took the Telefetic cable car lift to get to Montjuic castle but it is pricey.",
          "The introductory video was excellent, as were the views from the castle roof. We walked to the castle from the funicular and the vegetation was wonderful. We stopped along the way for the children to enjoy some hillside slides. Signage was excellent.",
          "There are several ways to get here, we took the Teleferico across Jardins de Joan Brossa. This gave us some really nice aerial views of that part of Barcelona. The initial construction of this fortress was started in 1640, and it's position high over the Barcelona Harbor,",
          "After taking the Telef\u00e9rico all the way up to this castle, we found out the best Views are actually from up there. The castle has lots of history and you can see it as soon as you get there. Walking around was easy and there were some interesting spots up there. We loved it!",
          "This is high up above the city, but worth the visit to see the harbor and the city. Take the stairs up to the Funicular and then go through castle. Not much to see, but interesting history.",
          "The castle is very interesting and has spectacular views of the city and the harbour. Beware of the additional 4 Euros to visit the Botanical Gardens. We asked for directions and were told \"It's just around the corner\" We asked various passers-by until a Polish couple with a map",
          "A true historical place that tells the story of Catalonian history. Very old but well kept, everything makes sense and has details or a story. Beautiful, especially with our very knowledgeable guide who told us everything we had to know.",
          "Full video review at YouTube by TravelClast Castell Montjuic is a beautiful fort truly atop one of the most breathtaking cities in the world. From here you can get a 360 panoramic view of this city by the sea, as well as learn about the termutouslous military history of this",
          "Not sure why this was so underrated, but it is definitely worth it! Getting there is easy, but there's a tip: if you want to opt out of the funicular there is actually a way of reaching the top by bus, which is quite a nice ride! Once there, the entrance is actually cheap",
          "Montjuic Castle is steeped in Catalonian history. It was founded back in the mid-17th century, but its more recent history has a rather dark past. The Spanish civil war is part of that and it brings some quite sad memories to many. The castle is on top of a hill and it was there",
          "If you want to visit the fortress you have to climb the hill. From the hill, there are magnificent views. There is no crowd of visitors, so you can rest in peace.",
          "This trip was booked from our agent in India through Julia travels. They first took us on a walking tour and then we climbed on to the bus which got us till the cable car station. It was an eye catching amazing journey and each minute was worth the trip. Had a fabulous rude way",
          "The castle has a nice military museum, lovely gardens and a fantastic view of all the city. I'd highly recommend visiting. Also, on certain days entrance is free.",
          "Went with wife and kids (7 & 9 years old). Really worth it for the views on cable car and castle. Very easy and quick also, no queue for cable car at all. Went up in the funicular railway but took the steps down from down and opposite the station - also well worth it as they",
          "Was good to embrace the history of this beautiful city of Barcelona but it was a little bit boring though as it is huge and lack of guidance. But good experience and the teleferic is something one must try",
          "We took the cable cars up to the castle, to save a long walk. We had no previous knowledge of the castle or it's relationship with Barcelona. It's a quite harrowing relationship, and very interesting. It is the venue of the last execution of a democratically elected European",
          "Beautiful location with great view of the whole Barcelona in 360 \u00b0 . The price is nothing to get in, we paid 3\u20ac per person! For real don't miss it",
          "It\u2019s REALLY worth a trip to the MONTJUIC castle & Gardens! The outside of the castle is so beautiful,,with gardens! Take the MONTJUIC TELEFERIC CABLE CAR... the RED ROUTE of hop on hop off bus drops you at the Cable station Metro too goes there.. you can walk down and enjoy",
          "Loved our visit here, great view of the city, we loved the greenery everywhere, the tall walls and the overall aura of the place",
          "We was planning to take the gondol from the harbour but they were closed due to strong wind, so we took a cab (crazy lady-driver wich argued in spanish on the phone with somebody all the way. She was scary but facinating) We walked from Parc de Montjuic, and went inside the",
          "May not be the best castle I have seen but its definitely worth visiting. First Euro5 (General Public) it's really worth it. You get to enjoy a scenic view of the city, understand the history of this castle and get to enjoy a 11-minute show. I took the funicular up and walked 12",
          "One of the best sighseeing in Barcelona. If you choose to go there by cable car you will have an awesome view of Barcelona and when you get to the Castle the view just get more and more amazing. A Castle full of stories and a great point to relax and enjoy your trip.",
          "We approached Montjuic from the wrong side and missed the cable car station and ended up hiking all the way up to the castle. The views there were spectacular, though the building itself doesn't have much of interest. We then spent a lot of time walking to find the National",
          "This is a great lace to visit especially if you have an interest in history and the Catalan struggle for recognition as a nation in their own right. There's a short film when you first enter the castle which is worth seeing and you are then free to wander around at your leisure.",
          "Worth the effort of getting there. If, like me you like photography the views over the harbour and the city are exceptional. Also, the castle itself has great history and is very reasonably priced for entry.",
          "Take the cable car up, enjoy the spectacular views and walk down. It\u2019s well worth a few hours. Learn a bit of history too",
          "Mantjuic Castle was a short walk from my hotel. I enjoyed walking there nightly as I would go to see the night views of this great city.",
          "We walked around the outside of the castle and has some photos taken. We chose not to pay the 5 euros to explore the castle but only because we were running out of time.",
          "The castle is definitely worth going to. To learn about the history, and if nothing else to see the panoramic views of the city. It is a bit of a climb to get there, however one can take the gondola, or bus service. Do not recommend taking the gondola from the seaport, unless",
          "The funicular was not running while we were there (it is out for 6 months - check the site), so we had a bus ride and a walk. The views from the top were great after walking through the gardens and the castle is amazing - well worth the trip.",
          "Views are stunning and if you get the cable car up it has stunning views of Barcelona. The price is cheap but you only really get the views. The castle has little else. If you just looking for sightseeing it\u2019s a beautiful place. Anything else though and you may be",
          "An interesting castle, with a lot of history. The views from the castle are superb. We didn't buy the extra ticket for the extended tour and think that might have been worth it as it would have been interesting to see what was underground. Also lots to see on the way up or down",
          "After eating lunch in the El Raval district, we took a taxi up to Castell de Montju\u00efc (8,20 euros). We debated whether not we should go inside, as there were some great views outside the castle. We finally decided to go in, and it was worth our time and money. The general fee to",
          "For 5 euro, you get to walk around the place and get some good views.. There were a few exhibitions.. Nothing that captured my attention. I would say, skip it, if you were short on time or money..",
          "This is an easy way to get amazing views of the city and the sea. The castle has a very interesting history, but if that's not your thing, you will enjoy looking around. At 5E to get in, great value too. Well worth the visit!",
          "Nice area, especially if you go there by walk, good sport walk time. The castle itself is not so impressive, just go in and walk around 30mn to 1h maximum. Nothing extraordinary except the view of Barcelona from castle defense walls. We visited it on sundqy, for free.",
          "Well worth the trip to learn about its history through the ages. Only \u20ac5.50 each so can\u2019t complain about the price. If it\u2019s views your after and thinking they\u2019ll be best form here, then think again, save your money a the views are just as good if not better from outside.",
          "The castle was fine,plenty to see but the views from the castle were excellent and worth the visit.cafe was great too",
          "Never made it into the castle. Just came up to the mountain looking for some quiet running trails close to downtown where we were staying. Steep ascent with big rewards at the top. Fabulous gravel loop around the castle with amazing views of the harbour. Come early to avoid the",
          "My husband and I came up Montjuic not even sure if we would visit the castle. Since it was only 5 euros we decided it was no loss if was awful. Well, I can tell you we were surprised in the best of ways. Montjuic Castle was one of the best history lessons we got on the area. A",
          "Got the cable car up the mountain (which was fun but \u20ac25 for 2x return journeys. Views are great from the top and can see the port, beach & inland. Castle is ok. \u20ac5 entrance fee but not much tk see on the inside. Opening up some the cells they talk about would be a great",
          "Its very calm, beautiful place where you can enjoy being in Barcelona. Remember that in February cable cars in Barcelona are under repair. The view is amazing from the castle both on the sea and the city.",
          "Good walk from cable car from port but you could get a second cable car or taxi. Was 5 euro in and we'll worth it for the views. Not much to see in castle itself.",
          "Easy access within anywhere in Barcelona. Nice to approach it from Pla\u00e7a Espanya and go all the way to the top. The view of Barcelona from there is breath taking! But I suggest you go back at night for the fountain show at 8pm to 9pm (please check schedules) as this provides",
          "Relatively cheap entrance fee from which you get great views from all sides of the castle over the city and out to sea over the ports, but to be honest not much else to keep you interested.",
          "We hopped on the Telerific de Montjuic for the ride up to the castle. This was one of the stops on the Hop on Hop off bus route which made it really easy to access. The views on the way up were quite spectacular and we were impressed with our first sight of the castle. We",
          "We took the Teleferic de Montjuic to the top and enjoyed the views whilst riding up and down. The views over Barcelona are lovely and the place has some interesting history but there isn't a lot there as you would expect to find in a castle. If you particularly want to also go",
          "Wonderful views, easy to get to. Not a ton to see in the museum but definitely worth the trip up for the photos and views!",
          "The castle is nice, but nothing special about it. The views from the top are something else. One side you get to see Barcelona Port, on the other you get the rest of the city... Must visit.",
          "The cable car ride up the hill is great - very smooth and feels quite safe. The views over Barcelona are spectacular - but the castle isn't up to much",
          "Get the right weather and you could walk around the top of this all day. The views are stunning and the entry price is reasonable. Bus to reach it is the 150, if you don\u2019t fancy walking / cable car / train.",
          "We\u2019ve been to Barcelona many times but never went to the Castell de Montju\u00efc until a few days ago. What a magnificent place to get great views of the city from all sides. No wonder as it was used as a military fortification overlooking the city for centuries. Bus No. 150 from",
          "Locating on a hill, it's a nice fortress to see. Walking around the walls, you can have the fine view of Barcelona, too.",
          "We made a quick visit to Montjuic Castle in January 2017, and the view was AMAZING at sunset. I enjoyed the history and the background, but the views were the best part. Definitely recommend.",
          "Montjuic Castle is a nice piece of history in Barcelona. It has some amazing views of the city and the port. Good for adults and for the younger. Make sure you get on the teleferic to get to the place, it\u2019s so worth it.",
          "We traveled up to the Fort on the Cable cars. A good size fortress with great views over Barcelona, the Mediterranean and the mountains. Lots of information panels giving the history of the fort.",
          "We went at 5.30pm. Don't expect to spend a lot of time here, we only stayed for 30 minutes (closes at 18pm). Great view of Barcelona, though. Medioce castle in general.",
          "We went there during an all afternoon and We had a good time to discover all the secret of this castle!",
          "I will have to upload our videos and photoslater if possible.. as they provide a good scope of the actual visit. We used cabify to hire a taxi to get is all the way up the hill for (I'd say) a fair price. The castle was cool to walk around but had no attractions really. We",
          "The castle is really a fortress that is fun to walk through and see how the defenses were built. The large defensive guns are still in place for you to walk up to and check out. There are great views of teh port and the city. Worth the time to go visit.",
          "A must visit. The fountain is lovely as are the musicians all around it. The views from top are spectacular and the entire Catalaunian region are for your eyes to feast on.",
          "The first thing about approaching any battlement or otherwise is that they're usually placed somewhere where it's going be hard for an enemy tactical assault. Montjuic Castle being based on top of a hill makes for a decent but for some a tiring walk up,and if walking's not your",
          "Go see this on a nice sunny day, views from the top are beautiful. Suggest taking the gondola up and walking down, takes a little time but well worth it.",
          "Great views of all of Barcelona! Fair admission price. Interesting to learn all the different ways the place was used thought history.",
          "We enjoyed this place on a clear winter morning. It has nice views of the ocean and city from each side of the castle, particularly from the top floor/roof. It\u2019s around \u20ac3pp so inexpensive. The botanic garden park area below looked very pretty to walk through, with not too many",
          "I believe we got lucky - we got to the Castle early and were in the queue for about 15 minutes. When we were leaving the queue was massive. I think it's 100% worth a 15-minute queue but (especially with kids) any longer then you may be better off walking around it and then",
          "We ended up getting here by bus because the funicular was closed. Construction is for approximately 6 months, starting from this past November. Walked the entire perimeter of the castle, but there weren't any good city views that weren't covered by trees. The best views around",
          "It was nice spending about 2 hours here during my last visit. Historical and cool. Nice places to sit down and have some reflections. You can also use the cable car to give you a panoramic view of the beautiful city. I would recommend this.",
          "Nice. Bit annoyed I could not see the prison as I had to wait till 3pm. Doesn't work hanging around with young children",
          "Montjuic Castle is on hill which can be accessed by walk & cable car. It give nice view of both sea & city. Perfact place for photography. Provide quite nice view during sunset. Entry fee is very nominal 5 euro & kids get discounted price. There are 13-14 point to see. you",
          "I didn't pay to go inside the castle as I thought the price was excessive so I walked all the way around it instead. You can get some lovely photos from the outside as well as the city and the harbour from the cliff edges but you can only see the perimeter walls, other than that",
          "Took the Teleferic Cable Car up to Montjuic Castle paid \u20ac9.80 Euros, that was after \u20ac3 Euros discount we were given at Poble Espanyol..Normal price is \u20ac12.80 for return trip by cable car. After arriving at the Castle we discovered a further entrance fee of \u20ac5 Euros if we",
          "While I didn't go in the castle grounds - the view was worth going up for. The views of the city are simply gorgeous.",
          "We went quite early so we couldn't take the funicular because it only starts at 10am and anyway the funicular station is already halfway to the top. We took the bus from a metro station. The bus stops at Montjuic castle as it's last stop. Since we were early we can take pictures",
          "Absolutely worth going through, the views from the top are worth it alone! Plenty to see as you wander through.",
          "Take the cable car up, tour round the castle & then stroll through the lovely gardens. The views across the city of Barcelona are fabulous. Amazingly there was an archery class in the grounds and you could watch them practice, although I was a bit concerned if they missed their",
          "The visit is great if you like great views. We climbed on foot, stopped for lunch at Martinez and then visited the castle. It\u2019s worth the walk for the views from up there.",
          "Montjuic Castle is free on the first Sunday of every month and every Sunday after 3pm. We went after 3pm, and I'm glad it was free because it definitely wasn't worth the ticket price. Provides a nice view of the sea and city. Not a lot of information in the castle and not very",
          "Tickets were not too expensive and we enjoyed the view. We used bus to get here. It was easy but very full of people.",
          "Nice views of Barcelona when walking around. Interesting knowledge about the turbulent times which the castle and the people living in Barcelona had to cope with.",
          "Montjuic Castle is worth a visit. Been there several times, you can reach it by bus and the cable car. It's a great place with amazing views and temporary museums. The history of the castle is described in every corner, making it easy for you to learn about it. Very interesting",
          "Being a military history buff, my friend and I saw this on our first day in Barcelona. Since the weather was perfect, we walked all around the entire castle, noting the various older cannons and more modern armament on display. The interior area has some exhibits, a film is",
          "**** Top tip - It's free to enter after 3pm on Sundays *** We took the Funicular & cable car up, however I'd suggest a taxi if a group of 3 or 4 of you because it will be a lot quicker and cheaper. Excellent views of the harbour and the city with some displays inside of the",
          "To visit the castle you can use the bus, the cable car or you can walk uphill through the park. The visit starts with a video presenting the castle history. On the walls facing the port some guns are still present. The views from the top are amazing.",
          "Everyone who visits Barcelona should go here. No need to buy a ticket ahead of time. 5 Euro entry fee and it is worth it just for the views of the harbor and the city. The history of the Castle/Fort was interesting. It is a little difficult to get to. There are cable cars and",
          "Nice spot for beautiful views of Barcelona, from the mountains to the seaside: we went there with a few kids (9-12) who did enjoy visiting the castle and the views, including the short trip using the teleferic system to get to the top of the montjuic, straight to the entrance of",
          "This place has got a fair walk and to find the cable car is not the easiest. We took the cable car up as we thought it would save time but the walk wouldn't have taken much longer. Once at the top there is an entry fee (as with everywhere in Barcelona) you can wander around.",
          "Found a nice walk up to the Montjuic Castle. Take the metro to the Parallel station and look for the funicular up Montjuic. Once you leave the funicular station, head up the road and you will find a staircase on the left side. It is a quiet place to walk and get a beautiful view",
          "Took the cable car up to the castle. The castle sits high on a hill just outside the port and has the most spectacular views across the city. So for no other reason go there for this. The castle itself is well maintained and has a great deal of history. All of which is well",
          "This was a really great activity, the castle was beautiful and in good condition. The views from the top of the castle were fantastic.",
          "We got a taxi from Passeig de Garcia (approx \u00a310) to the cable car, then cabled up to the castle for spectacular 360 degree views. \u20ac5 adults \u20ac3 children entrance fee to the castle. WC's in the castle and vending machine drinks and snacks available too. Lovely morning out, then",
          "Spending a few days in Barcelona filming for my video and staying just off the busy La Ramblas. Took the cable car to the castle which i have reveiwed and uploaded pictures separately. Worth the \u20ac5 entry fee to see the castle in its entirety and to see those views. Great",
          "We took the hop-on-hop-off bus through Montjuic. We got off at the Montjuic castle and decided to ride the cable cars up to the castle. This was really cool! The views from the cable cars were incredible and the castle itself was so massive. I remember looking out to the water",
          "We walked up to the castle & took the cable car down. It was a tough but rewarding climb, incredible views from the top, across Barcelona. The cable car ride also offered great views. Would recommend doing it the other way round.",
          "Recently visited the castle unexpectedly from doing the red route bus tour and had a fab time. We paid a little extra for the tour guide and access to areas not open to the public; the dungeons and tower. Our guide Marie Paz (not sure if that's the correct spelling?) was",
          "Historic Beautiful castle that shows not only an in-depth view into Barcelona\u2019s past but provides an incredible view over the current metropolis below. The cable car ride up there it\u2019s also great for any one, at any age.",
          "We went up here for the views but it proved to be a very interesting visit. Quite a bloody history of violence against your own country men is recorded here. The views are great even on a cloudy rainy day. Take the cable car up and down, more good views.",
          "We travelled here by the metro,funicular railway and then by cable car which were all very enjoyable with the latter transport providing fabulous views of the city and port areas.Then for a very reasonable 5 euros each we entered the castle which again provided even more",
          "It is a nice place, You can see old castle (not medieval, rather modern), it is localizated on the hill, good point is to climb over there, You can also go by metro, and then climb by a special tram (we were with liitle kid, so that was good option). There are nice view over",
          "The best reason to come here is the views. They are spectacular (perhaps the best in Barcelona), over City one side and the port the other. Castle is nice too and there is a visitor centre but the exhibits and info are not the best. It\u2019s free to get in after 3pm on a Sunday.",
          "Decided to walk up the hill to Montjuic Castle and other attractions on the way. U can get a cable car ride but it's a nice walk up the hill and not challenging. Nice gardens, trees, water features and other attractions to see on the way. Also great views of the whole city",
          "Very nice castle with a good view. It was cheap to get inside, and it was very good to walk around just for as long as you wanted. I wish everyone could go and see the view from the watchtower. We paid \u20ac3 to go inside.",
          "Do not walk, take bus 150 from Plaza Espagna. An impressive info about the Civil War and dark days of Spain. On a much lighter note: if you want to understand the Spain and how diverse its culture is (Spanish, Catalunian, Basque or Galician) watch \"Spanish Affair, and Spanish",
          "While Montjuic Castle indeed offers stunning views of the city to the north and the port to the south, I was fascinated by the Catalan history it offered, particularly during the dark days of the Spanish Civil War. I found myself constantly cross-referencing with Google to learn",
          "There were a variety of small exhibitions to gain information about the castle. Also the most amazing views can be seen from inside and the walk around the perimeter of the castle. Be mindful of the cyclists and runners who use it as a track! Drawbacks; there's no cafe on site,",
          "Dont walk up as its tough going. I misjudged and got bus to Paral-lel but hadnt worked out how to get the 150 bus from there. The funicular and cable car can be taken from this station. But you can also get the bus from Placa Espanya. I got it back down and stopped to see (the",
          "I didn't know much about Barcelona and in general Spanish and Catalonian history. This was a very interesting visit. Allow yourself plenty of time to go through the exhibit. Great views of the city. 5 euro entry. 10 euro taxi from the city. 20 minute downhill walk to the Magic",
          "There is an entrance fee of 5\u20ac (you get a discounted price of 3\u20ac if you\u2019re under 29 or over a certain age). The views are stunning but there isn\u2019t much information on what purpose the Castell served, the history, etc.",
          "We loved the views, and, on a bank hol (24th) it was free, which we loved even more. Our tip - the walk from the funicular is pretty strightforward, but, if lazy, get the 150 bus...don't bother with the cable car",
          "This place is a must see on the list when you in Barcelona. Very good price only \u20ac10 per person. Including a tour. With a tour you can get to places which is not available for a public. Great history. And the views are just to die for.",
          "Why? Because they've started to charge an entrance fee, and for us, that makes it no longer an \"attraction\". We've visited many times in the past and always enjoyed our visits, not least because there used to be a quite reasonable caf\u00e9 where you could get a bite to eat and",
          "Loved the tram ride up the hill, great pictures and my toddler loved \u201cflying.\u201d Decent sized castle, in good repair. Great views of both the city and the sea. Had an exhibit called Memory about the victims of the Spanish Civil War, which was educational but extremely",
          "We went there during second week of September. So it\u2019s not busy. Nice view. You can take the cable car to the top and walk down or the cable car both ways.",
          "We went up to the castle by cable car which was fun. The castle is empty but has great views of the city.",
          "This castle was pretty cool! Well worth the \u20ac10 entry as it has some pretty spectacular views. It was very easy to get to by bus which drops you pretty much at the door. I would recommend a visit. We spent about an hour there.",
          "4 of us visited this castle beginning September 2018. As with all castles they are on a hill, so transport is recommended to reach the top and the drawbridge. Outside the gardens there are a few small stalls set up selling jewellery, scarves, etc. Its a huge castle with a lot",
          "NEVER NEVER NEVER park your car in the parking lot of this castle or close to it. We lost our four bags and we lost thousands of dollars in the middle of the day. We left for only two hours where we thought it is a safe place where all the car parked there and so many buses",
          "We travelled here via the funicular and cable car and also had the guided tour. The tour was very informative and covered the entire history and also allowed entry into some non public areas including the tower, fantastic and must see and do",
          "I\u2019m a big fan of castles .. I visit it everywhere if I travel but this was really the most boring place ever. There was nothing to see. The main entrance is more or less nice but the rest is just waste of time.",
          "The castle gives wonderful views over the city and harbour and out to sea. The castle building dates from the 17th and 18th centuries, and is a well proportioned and elegant structure, with a moat, battlements and bastions, and a broad open roof terrace with historic tower. The",
          "Tremendous views from here of both the port and city. I could see all the way to the airport. The castle is unremarkable, but important to the city and region. Could start a day here and then head down to Miro Foundation, some Olympic venues and the Catalonia National Museum",
          "Splendid location close to the harbor. Great military details available inside which explains need for such a historic structure. Amazing cable car which provides a full review of the city",
          "Getting to Montjuic Castle was fun; the funicular train and the cable car up the hill. The castle offers good views of Barcelona, and hold historical significance to the city. We walked back down the hill, through Park Montjuic and it was a half day well spent. The views offered",
          "If you love history this is a great place to visit as it has so much significance to the history of Catalonia. Some of the history is sad as it relates to the place being a prison and place of execution (and torture). The views from the castle are absolutely incredible also.",
          "Nice tourist site to help while away a few hours in Barca. Not expensive, only \u20ac5 per person (adult). Good views from the top. Not overly historic or much to see in the actual structure... but more a good vantage point.",
          "The Montjuic Castle is the prize after two cable rides. It is a great walk on a nice sunny day. Great views to the ocean and the piers. Also a lot of history. They have movies by the main lawn on summer nights.",
          "This place provides absolute stunning views , spend one to two hours there to capture beautiful pictures of the new suburb area from difference angles, you can also access to music fountain after sunsets pictures taking.",
          "After a quick pre booked ride on the cable car we decided to visit the castle! We bought tickets for the castle on the day and found out we get a discounted rate if you are under 29 years of age! What a bonus! The views from the castle is just truly phenomenal seeing both sea",
          "This is a must see if you are in Barcelona. The castle is great, there is so much to see. It has great views at the top. The castle does a great job at explaining things throughout the castle with placks in several languages. If you go when it\u2019s hot I highly suggest bringing",
          "It is easy to overlook Montjuic Castle on a visit to Barcelona, as you really are spoilt for choice in this dazzling city. This would be a shame though. The Castle has both history and beauty to recommend it. The Castle is a former military fortress and has played an important",
          "The castle itself is probably of historical importance, however as a family it\u2019s the scenery that matters most. From the mountain there, you can see the whole of Barcelona city and it\u2019s main marks plus the whole of the harbor. In addition to the lovely walk and water fountains",
          "Bus tour to site then cable car to top of hill with spectacular views over the city the port and ocean. Well worth the effort but it gets very busy as the day progresses.",
          "The cable car is quite slow going a relatively short distance but it\u2019s worth it for the view. The castle isn\u2019t overly interesting but gives amazing panoramas of the bay and the city. Definitely worth the traverse. The walk back down is long and not ideal for anyone who",
          "I didn't actually go in since a concert event was being held there that day. Walking around the castle perimeter, you are afforded very nice views of the container harbor area below. One is tempted to walk in a complete circle around the castle, but beware that this is",
          "We loved the cable car ride up to the different levels. Such a beautiful view and we enjoyed walking around in the parks. We did not go in the castle but enjoyed the view from the outer area.",
          "After a trip on the gondola's up the mountain we only went to the castle to see the view. But after checking the cost we were surprised it was only 5 euro each. Because of this and the heat we didn't spend to much time exploring but when we did see looked very interesting. The",
          "As a defensive structure, this castle has lost its importance a long time ago. As the historical exposition tells, the first castle to be found at that place was built around the beginning of 15th century. It was rebuilt several times, until the present structure was finally",
          "We used the cable cars to get up to the castle (which I\u2019d also thoroughly recommend) & arrived at about 11.30am. As 2 adults in our 20s & a 3 year old we were really impressed with the entry fee, only \u20ac6! The views over Barcelona are absolutely incredible, I don\u2019t think you",
          "A visit to Montjuic Castle is a great way to view the city and surrounding see and hills while exploring architecture and history. The subway, funicular and cable car rides were great fun as well.",
          "Montjuic Castle was well worth the long trip it took to get there! The views from the top of the castle were spectacular and the perfect place to take some great pictures. The small museum inside the castle was also very interesting and gives a greater insight into the history",
          "Lovely! As many have said, the trip up is worth the stunning view of Barcelona and the ocean. I would invest in the tour as it gave you insight into the history of the castle and Barcelona. It lasted about an hour and 15 and was full of great information and stories. With the",
          "We visited the castle for a few hours on a very hot day on July 13. There are several different ways to get to the top of the mountain where the castle is located including a lift that drops you off at the top. We took Uber, which for 12 Euros was cheaper than the tram for the",
          "This was a great day trip, especially on a sunny day, not as crowded in the mornings/early afternoon so I would go then. They had beer at the castle grounds which was a great touch, the place sits high above the city so you can see it all. A great way to take cityscape",
          "There is nothing interesting in the castle, but the castle itself is interesting and has a great view of the harbor and the entire city. The easiest way to visit it is by the cableway, which is quite expensive.",
          "There is not a great deal to see as far as the 'castle' is concerned. It is actually a fort and is situated in an awesome position on the mountain overlooking to sea and city. Entrance cost 5 euros per person so it's not a huge expense for really fantastic views. Sadly, the cost",
          "Nice castle with some good views in the distance, though the dock below isn\u2019t pretty. Not sure how accessible it would be in a wheelchair due to the cobbles in places.",
          "Entry fee was \u20ac5 and we were only charged for adults, our two children (oldest 10) got in free. We spent a good 2 hours here wondering around and admiring the views. Most of the signs are also in English which made the trip more enjoyable for us. There are also tours for an",
          "The castle is located in Montjuic Hill, in western part of Barcelona and it can be seen by almost all points. The castle was built on the foundations of the first fortifications of 1640 from the period of Principality of Catalonia. Has played an important role and more often",
          "The fortress is beautifully maintained, nice views of the city. There is a good uphill walk with good historical perspective. The interior of the castle could have better historical pieces.",
          "Really enjoyed visiting the castle, there was a wealth of information for anyone interested in the local history and if not, excellent panoramic views of the city.",
          "Cannot views of Barcelona from a historic castle. Unmatched. Even the cable car ride up to the castle is breathtaking. Very dreamy. And we went on a hot day can just imagine what it looks like in the evening/night. Only \u20ac13 rtn on the cable car and we paid \u20ac6 for the both of us",
          "The castle is free on the first Sunday of the month so today was a good day to go. It is actually a pretty nice castle. The views from the castle are amazing!",
          "It was a great adventure to come up with funicular all the wY to the castle. View is beautiful. Historical review and video. There are 2 mountains in Barcelona so Montjuic is a must see as many buildings were made with its stone by Gaudi and other artists in Barcelona. They",
          "Got off at a stop from the hop on hop off bus. Took the cable car up, but forgot how much it was. They also take your photo that you can purchase at the top. The views at the castle are great overlooking Barcelona. $5 euro pp to get in. Spent maybe 40 min there. Old history,",
          "Montju\u00efc castle was a great day out. I was traveling with myself and my pre teen son. We took the tel\u00e9feric (cable car) to the top (20\u20ac total for two) and the views were beautiful. The tel\u00e9feric ride took about 10-15 min to get to the top. Once there, you are free to walk around",
          "We got the Metro to Paral-lel, the Funicular Railway (included on the same travelcard, so essentially free on the way there as it is a simple interchange if you follow the signs), and then the cable car which is 12\u20ac return. You can get good views from outside the castle, but",
          "The views across Barcelona are spectacular from the castle. We took the funicular train from Paral-lel station to Montju\u00efc then walked to the castle. The walk from the station to the castle is uphill so I would suggest wearing sensible footwear. On the way down we took the cable",
          "Really enjoyed the visit here. The views of Barcelona are amazing and it's easy to walk around. I recommend getting the cable car up and then walk down",
          "To enter this castle one needs to pay extra entry fee after taking off the cable car or you need to walk up the hill to the castle. However for the 5\u20ac extra you get a wonderful view of the city and the suburbs. Great! You can walk around and up several levels- the more higher",
          "Montjuic Castle has great views and a lot of history. The entrance fee it's only 5 euros. You can get there taking the bus no 150.",
          "I recommend just doing the ride up on the cable car and then coming down walking. The fort will take 2 hours and it\u2019s an ok fort. I would rather save the time for drinks at the beach later in the evening. :)",
          "Castle is easy to reach by taking the metro to L2/L3: Paral-lel, then entering the funicular (already included in your ticket, don't exit the station). You can either walk up the hill or take the cable car. Castle admission fee is only 5 euros. You can see the city very well",
          "You access this best by the gondola. This has 360 degree views of the city and beaches. Great photos and interesting history at the same time. Gondola 12 euro and castle 5 euro well worth it.",
          "Fabulous views from the top and the cable cars on the the way up to the castle, definitely a must visit attraction, we had a great time exploring",
          "We took the cable car up through the park... can't imagine walking up there. A lovely castle with interesting history. Views of Barcelona are amazing. Not much in the way of getting coffees, food. Limited shade at the top so be prepared for the sun. Nice friendly staff too",
          "A sky lift ride up to Montjuic is a cool thing to do in Barcelona. The view of the city and the coastline is beautiful. The history of the fort is very interesting.",
          "This is the epicenter of a classic tourist spot, loaded with cameras around necks and kids running all over but check it out for the view if nothing more.",
          "We decided to pay the extra 5E each for a guided tour and we loved it. Mar (probably spelt wrong, sorry) was very friendly and knowledgeable. We got fast access to the dungeons and tower and learnt a lot about the history. The views are breath taking. You must go!",
          "I visited Montjuic Castle on the advice of my airbnb host and am so very glad we did. I knew little of the history of the site and decided to pay for the guided tour (\u20ac5 entry and \u20ac5 for the tour). I can say that the guided tour was fantastic and probably one of the best value",
          "Great views, so nice to see the city from above with the city at one side and the marina and sea at the other, definitely worth going up to, although we expected there to be a cafe as there is one advertised and we hadn't eaten, however when we got up to the castle there wasn't",
          "So I live in Barcelona for the past 4 years and this has been my favorite spot when am in plaza espa\u00f1a.sitting infront of the castle on sunday mornings are one enjoyable moments.there is always a man playing sweet melodies from his guitar but the most charming views from the",
          "This castle dates back to 1660 but it underwent extensive renovation in the mid-18th century due the major damage it sustained during the War for Spanish Succession (early 1700s). In the 19th century it became a prison and in 1940 the President of Catalonia was executed there",
          "There is plenty of fort to look at, if you have an interest in such things - would probably take the better part of an hour just to stroll around the various bastions, and I managed to make nearly three hours of it, so the 5euro fee is a bargain. Castle-stuff aside, there is",
          "We did the guided tour offered by the castle. It takes you into the dungeons where prisoners of Spanish civil war were held. This area is closed to general public. The guided tour also takes you to the very top of the top of the tower, which has fantastic views of the city. This",
          "\u20ac5 to enter and it was ok, some shells on display and the cannons. Not a great deal to see but ok for an hour mooching about",
          "Provides the best panoramic view of Barcelona. Other than that, not much to see/visit inside the castle, which is more like a fortress. Good for a short stroll after getting off Teleferic Montjuic.",
          "The panoramic views from the castle are breathtaking and I\u2019d say the best in Barcelona its only \u20ac5 each to get in. You can take the teleferic de montjuic to the top ie cable car there\u2019s a return fare or one way price but can\u2019t remember what they where. To get to the castle it\u2019s",
          "Take the cable car ride to the top of Montjuic and tour the Castle. Be sure and see the free video to get a perspective on the history of Barcelona. The many levels of the castle are very interesting to tour and all offering breathtaking views of the city.",
          "This was a delightful part of our trip. The cable car ride to the top wasn't long, but it was also priced well for a family. The video at the beginning of the castle tour is a MUST. Find out what time it's in your native language and see it. The history is both brutal and",
          "This is definitely my top pick in Barcelona! You can get the funicular from the bottom of the hill and them walk all the way up to the Castle, it is somewhat steep (after all it is a hill) but you will enjoy the gardens, the peace and the views - it is all breathtaking! Try to",
          "Take the cable car up early in hot weather, much easier than the 30 minute walk up. Between 3 - 5 euros entrance fee. Lots of history but not a lot of it in English. We mainly went for the views though which were spectacular. Worth it if you go early, not worth the queue for",
          "After a long walk up the hill (you can also take the cable car) we enjoyed walking across the castle (more a fortress really) and enjoyed the magnificent views over the sea, harbor and city. Just the views make the visit worthwhile.",
          "When you start the cable car ride from the bottom of Montjuic you get a glimpse of the terrific view you are going to get on the top. The cable car is expensive but worth it. There is nothing else on the top except the superb view of the sea front and Barcelona. It is worth",
          "If you like fortresses you are going to have a good field day but also anyone who likes view from above will enjoy el castillo (not a palace!) First practical things: It is located on a mountain in the middle of Barcelona; to get there you can get with your car (parking is",
          "Take the Teleferic de Montjuic to the top and visit this castle. To be fair it is not really a castle but a fort. Great views from the top.",
          "We really enjoyed this trip. We used the cable car to get to the Castle which takes you up the steepest part, but you can walk it. Once there you will be blown away by the views. I definately recommend going in the Castle as it is only about 5 Euros and there is a lot of history",
          "Get a bus to the top, from plaza Espa\u00f1a, number 150. You can use the same ticket as metro tickets. There are great views from outside the castle as there are inside, but bear in mind it really isn\u2019t very castle like, apart from some towers, a moat (no water) and a bridge. It",
          "Walking up the park then taking cable car to the castle is so entertaining. Waiting in que for almost 20 minutes to get ticket so I wish I got the ticket beforehand. It was rainy and overcasted sky when I visited so if you\u2019re interested in photography check the weather before",
          "The trip on the cable car was an experience in itself affording wonderful views over the city. The castle is interesting and the short film gives a very good idea of the Catalan history. Sadly we didn\u2019t have the time to walk down into the park, so my advice would be to allow",
          "We were really excited to visit the castle and trekked up the hill to get there, but sadly it was closing 40 minutes after we arrived due to a strike. That's fair enough, but it would have been great to have a warning placed further down the hill! Anyway, great visit, striking",
          "If you want unrivaled views of Barcelona city, the port, the Mediterranean and south to the airport this is definitely the place. You can catch a bus, spend time walking, although it involves lots of stairs and wooded slopes or take an escalator from Palau Nacional. Catch the",
          "Located on the top of Montjuic hill, this fortress offer a great historical visit, as well as great views of Barcelona and Barcelona's port. We went there on a rainy day, but still enjoyed it. Take the Telepheric up the hiil. Views from there are unique",
          "Having made the trip to head over to Montjuic and the use of the Funicular we arrived on Montjuic. We headed left upon arrival towards the Amphitheatre. When we arrived it was nice weather and provided some nice picture opportunities. We walked further round Montjuic before",
          "We chose to walk the outer perimeter of this fortress, rather than pay the admission fee to enter. The views of the city and the sea are beautiful (even though you are overlooking the working docks of Barcelona). The surrounding park area made for a nice peaceful walk, but the",
          "Panoramic view from the castle, easy to get there from Paralel metro station ( Green L3 Line) and you get the telepherique that takes you to the top. If someone has time, it is nice to return on foot at least till the middle stop.",
          "Learned so much throughout my trip to Spain including this stop! Stunning views and so much history.",
          "Nice fort with great views of Barcelona! Only 5 euros entrance fee, but it's well worth a visit. You can go by foot from the bottom of the hill or by cable car.",
          "Interesting fort steeped in history. It is worth watching the informational video upon entry to learn about the castles significance in Barcelona\u2019s history. Entrance price is cheap (5-7 euro I believe). It is free entry 1st Sunday of every month and after 3pm every Sunday. Views",
          "Price fir entry really good. WE visited monjuic on an overcast morning and hubby could see clouds moving so made me wait it out . Do glad we did as the views alone made it all worthwhile ! You can see the whole of barcelona and the coast line . The castle and grounds seeped in",
          "My family visited on Easter weekend and had a great visit. I would highly recommend taking the guided tour it only costs another 5 Euros and is well worth the cost. The dungeons had just re opened a few days prior and I don\u2019t think it was included in general admission price.",
          "Very nice fort with view to Barcelona port,entry fee in April 2018 was 5 \u20ac adult/children free. Visit aprox 1- 1.5 hrs.",
          "Great history and amazing views over Barcelona, the ports and the coast. Very reasonable admission charge too.",
          "We visited the fort on a cold, rainy day in April, but we probably will never get the chance to get back to Barcelona, so we weren\u2019t going to let a little rain stop us. The fort is impressive in sheer size, but there was not a lot of information about its history. We took the",
          "Traveled with a large group and used the cable car to get to the castle. The castle is beautiful and had breathtaking views of Barcelona. Wonderful spot for photos.",
          "The admission wasn't expensive\u2014only 5\u20ac\u2014but there's not really much to see here besides the sala where there's a history of Barcelona. There's also a great 360-degree view at the top, and frankly, that's worth the price of admission. You can walk to the castle, but be warned,",
          "This is a great place to visit if you are interested in the history of Barcelona and the civil war. The castle also offers stunning views across Barcelona and the port. It's also not overly touristy and you can wander around freely. We pretty much had the place to ourselves in",
          "This is a must visit. Views are fantastic. Lots off history. Enjoyed the information about The Nazis. My son was in the wheelchair and this was very difficult to get around due to the cobbled stones from the lift to castle entrance.",
          "The views from the castle are excellent on a clear day and a very interesting building.. Much of the enjoyment is the arrival or departure - as the best way to get here is by the cable car which in itself provides great views and depending on where you have come from or are",
          "If you are a fan of spectacular views than this is the attraction to go. It's off the city center and nearer to Barcelona Port and to get to the Castle, you can either walk, drive, or take the cable car which we did. The Castle isn't huge and you can complete the visit in less",
          "We took the cable car up to the castle and were treated with some very impressive views of the city. The views were even better once at the top of the castle. The castle is steeped in history and the information boards dotted around (in various languages) tell you the story of",
          "This place is steeped in history and the exhibits help you to understand this. Quite a sad history tbh but worth going to see all about it and what implications this place had on Barcelona. It only cost a few euros depending on age to get in. He views alone are absolutely",
          "Nice place to take children for walk a visit, interesting history but not much can see only have very nice space and view to the city.",
          "When planning on visiting the castle, don't go all the way up with public transport. Instead, put on your hiking shoes and walk. The views and parcs towards the castle are amazing. The castle itself isn't really interesting other than it brings you to the top of the mountain for",
          "Enjoy the breathtaking view of the city and the coastline. The fortress con museum can reach by cable car, as an added attraction.",
          "For us this was an unplanned trip. We looked online and saw they had free entry on the first Sunday of every month, so took the opportunity to explore. The weather was pretty miserable, so we wouldn't have gone otherwise. Make sure to go on a clear day, or overcast with low",
          "As other reviewers have said, the castle is not outstanding, especially if we compare it to other castles in Spain. The cable car ride is not the most thrilling, especially if you have taken the one to Monserrat. Imo, the main attraction of this place is that it is a great",
          "Myself and a friend visited this castle in March, was quite cold as it's so high up so bring your coats and gloves! We enjoyed our visited but weren't entirely overwhelmed by the experience. The castle itself is mainly ruins now and doesn't hold many artefacts of interest. The",
          "We took the Cable Car up from the beach and walked up the hill to the Castle. It was early Feb on an overcast day so the views were not the clearest but we still enjoyed the super views of the city. The castle is well presented but apart from the Exhibition on the Nazis in",
          "not the biggest place we visited in barcelona but with a low entry price in comparision to else where else and how long we spent there, it was by far the best value but a nice place to wander around with amazing views of the city, mountains and coast and lots of photo",
          ".........is this fortress. We had to queue a while to get tickets, partly because the ticket seller was very friendly and wanted to talk to everybody! Despite being a very sunny sunday morning, most of the viewpoints were very quiet so the opportunity to take some great photos",
          "Go here on a sunny day - Stunning views over the city and port. Castle not the prettiest building but has wonderful views. Learned a lot about the city\u2019s history, quite an eye opener! Visited on a lovely sunny day, hard to believe such a lovely spot has been home to imprison,",
          "We got to the Montjuic castle via metro and funicular and cable car (which is really good value for money). We were pleasantly surprised by the Castle and grounds and found the history very interesting. The Castle also has the most amazing views of Barcelona city and there are",
          "We visited the castle by funicular, then the cable car. The views from the top across the port are spectacular. The massive guns on the top are a reminder of the days of the Spanish Civil war.",
          "Definitely worth visiting. This place gives a nice view to the city on Barcelona. Theres not much to see in the castle but tickets are very cheap",
          "I hiked up to the castle via the Olympic park which was steep but still enjoyable. The actual castle is more of a fort and costs to go in (3 euro for student/young person). You learn a bit of the history of the fort and of some WWII history which was nice. The views are also",
          "Castell De Montjuic is one of highest sights of Barcelona. You can walk up from Plaza De Espana through the \u201cFontana Magica\u201d (Magic Fontain) One you walked up all stairs take a right turn and than just follow the way up. Its a 20-30min walk. Easily to master and more you go on",
          "Used the funicular and Cable Car to get to the castle. Reasonably priced entry - tip 16-29 year olds get reduced entry. The Castle is very interesting and you get great views in all directions of Bracelona. The history of the castle is also well covered in the displays. Bit",
          "Not a history fanatic but really enjoyed strolling around the grounds. Clarified a few things regarding Catalan claim for independence. Reasonable entry fee. Shame the tower view is only done a couple times a day, we missed them as we visited late afternoon. The views are",
          "Beautiful place with amazing views of the city sun was out which was great amazing history all around was so nice that I proposed to my girlfriend by the tower overlooking the city and the cable car up was exciting too as that\u2019s my first cable car ride and to top it of my",
          "Stopped off on city bus tour and took the cable car to the fort. There is a small entry fee (5\u20ac, 3\u20ac concessions) and it is well worth it. Start tour with a video presentation of recent history and its significance to Catalans. Many of the artillery installations are still on",
          "Took the metro bus here which stops nearby. The views from the castle are amazing. On one side you can see the port and on the other the city of Barcelona. I came here straight from Tibidabo so it was great being able to see it directly across from here. Inside the castle there",
          "Provides a great viewpoint of Barcelona and the sea. Great getaway from all the city noise. Walking around the gardens and castle was relaxing. Definitely a special Barcelona experience. Will return again.",
          "The Montjuic Castle offers a great view over the port and has a really well made museum about the history of the hill and the castle. I can only recommend the place.",

          "The Montjuic castle isn\u2019t much really. But the gardens and the views of the city from there are magnificent. It\u2019s a wonderful place to spend an afternoon picnicking. Montjuic is quite accessible, you have cable cars running till the top or if you\u2019re more adventurous, you can",
          "Lots of history provided in the written guide provided with $5 entrance fee and the plaques at each attraction. Easy to get to via the 150 bus just outside and across the street from the Espana metro station. It drops you right at the bottom of the steps to the entrance at the",
          "The views from the top of the castle were fantastic and certainly the highlight of the visit to this castle. It was also interesting to watch the continual procession of planes coming in to land at Barcelona Airport. However, the castle does lack the Wow factor. At a cost of",
          "Had intended to go on the cable car but it was shut so continued up to the castle. Magnificent example, positioned perfectly to protect Barcelona. However there's very little substance to the place except the building itself. Toilet facilities were abismal, all gent's urinals",
          "In Barcelona there are some museums which are free of charge during first Sunday in the month. This castle is one of them. It can be easily reached by bus No. 150 from Av Reina Maria Cristina - Pl de l'Univers which is close to Pl. Espanya and the last bus stop is your final",
          "The funicular was out of service. We took the bus. The Montjuic Castle is on top of the mountain close to the harbor of Barcelona. You have a very nice view on Barcelona. And you can do a nice walk on the castle. Although it was not really high season, we had to queue 15 minutes.",
          "Montjuic Castle has 2 views that overlook the city. One is the central Barcelona and the other to industrial port of Barcelona. You need to wear comfortable shoes as walking round takes at least an hour and at high temperatures it may be quite warm, so you would want to stay",
          "Shockingly used many times to bombard Barcelona itself. We had a great time wandering around in the winter sun. Everything clean and tidy and access from the cable car makes it easy to get to. 5 euros each for entry is well worth spending.",
          "Have visited many forts not dissimilar to this, so the interior wasn't exactly a wow, though there's an interesting historical exhibit. The battlement views are superb, however. We went on Sunday afternoon when it's free, and I probably wouldn't rush to pay to visit this.",
          "Wow what a place to visit and it doesn't seem to be an attraction that gets widely promoted to visit. We visited in June. You can hop off one of the city sightseeing tour buses or take a funicular train which is signposted on a tour guide map and was easy to find. You buy a",
          "The castle is a must see when in Barcelona. I enjoyed the stroll on the grounds and the museum inside.",
          "A must, must do. The views are spectacular and the peace and serenity captivating. Escape the hustle and bustle of Barcelona city. It was a highlight of our visit.",
          "Well worth the trip here, especially if you take the cabin lift!!! Stupendous views and interesting structure.",
          "A great piece of Barcelona\u2019s history is told in a visit here and at only 5 euro entry it is good value for money i would advise to use the local bus service we did not and used the cable cars from the docks then on the hill although a good experience it adds alot of expense to",
          "We haven't actually been into the citadel on our last few visits since they introduced the entry fee, but go up for the views anyway. We walk or get the metro to Pl Espanya then walk up to Caixa Forum art gallery to see what's on. (Loads of school parties getting into Warhol",
          "This was my favorite touristic spot during my visit in Barcelona, the castle is just majestic and you can see impressive and stunning views of Barcelona and the sea from the top and different sides of the castle.",
          "I didn't go inside the castle, but from outside even you can have some nice views around. The ticket was around 5 euros as i remember.",
          "We meandered on foot up to the Montjuic Castle from the National Catalan of Museum of Art. The castle is part of a very impressive fortress and, with the amazing views on offer, well worth the climb.",
          "I would truly recommend visiting Montjuic castle during your stay in Barcelona. We stumbled upon the castle after taking the cable chair up the hill and it was a great surprise. As we visited in late December, there wasn't much of a queue for tickets and tickets were also fairly",
          "After a brisk walk up the hill, the castle views are fabulous (perfect winter weather the day we visited). We had a guided tour which was good - nice to climb to the top of the tower.",
          "The entry fee was 5 euros. The queue was very long with 1-2 cashiers. Really need to speed up the queues. There is no need to use the free lockers as you can bring your bags into the castle. The exhibition described the troubled past of Barcelona - found this very informative. I",

          "We came to the Castell de Montjuic a bit late in the day so our visit was shorter than I\u2019d have liked. Entry was 5eu each. There is not too much to be seen it is a fortified barracks that would have been home to a sizeable troop at one time. It dominates the skyline overlooking",

          "The cable car going up was fun and offered great views of the city. At the castle itself, the view was even more beautiful. You get not only the city view but also the seascape at the other end. You have to pay separately for the cable car and the castle entrance though.",
          "We should have started here at the highest point. We walked from MNAC to here on a hot day. The castle is ok. It wasn't my favorite. The views are great but not really that much to see here except the gardens which are great. I would not rush here unless you want to see",

          "There were 7 of us in our party and the Castillo was a good way to see something interesting, wander, chat. The views are impressive even though we didn't have the best weather (dark, cloudy and rainy in August!). The little museum about the site was pretty decent and explained",
          "The star attractions are the views; either from the top of the fortress or from around the walls looking down at the port, the marina area or back into the city. The walk up through the park should be savoured; or to put it another way-walk slowly! 5 Euros is probably right just",
          "Nice view over Barcelona, you can make some beautiful photos. But don't expect too much of this castle, because it is not that special (at least it wasn't to me, I enjoyed the view more than the castle itself).",
          "We went about 10am and it was lovely and quiet I paid 8 euros for myself and 16 year old daughter to get in so it was reasonably priced. The views are amazing and the exhibitions inside the castle are very interesting. I would take drinks with you as although a cafe is",

          "Not what I expected. The expositions are really poor and the whole castle is a bet sterile. However, the  view of the city of Barcelona and the port are great - if you want to enjoy the view Montju\u00efc castle is worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful place and great to visit even in the winter months (and warm months too, I imagine). Very cool place to learn about the history and check out the view. There is a bus that takes you directly to the castle.",
          "Beautiful castle. It's worth to see this marvelous creation",
          "A great place to visit with an incredible view over the city and the sea.\nIt was a lovely surprise to see that you can play a couple of boardgames inside(I'm not sure if this is a permanent activity).\nMy advice is to walk around the castle, \u2026",
          "History and amazing view over Barcelona and sea. It worth to go up there to have a 360 degree view, but not only. You can be part of a total quiet and you can relax watching the infinite sea.",
          "A very nice castle. You have a great view from it. Also, there is a part of the castle where you have to pay to visit. I personally didn't go inside. However it is worth to visit free part too.",
          "To be honest there isn't much to see at the castle. There were great panoramic views of the city and the docks from the top.  There is a nice cafe and bar inside. The exhibits were not to our taste, so of little interest. Didn't spend long there.",
          "Spectacular views across Barcelona and the port. The cable car ride was well worth the money, although I'm not keen on heights!! The return journey was easier as had a couple of reasonably priced beers at the castle cafeteria.",
          "This used to be a military space, now, despite being one of the nicest place in Barcelona, Tourism has been converted in a locals-don't like to go- Uncontrolled develop of tourism, thanks to major's rules - they get the money.. - as the \u2026",
          "Definitely go see this if you can. It's beautiful!",
          "We took the funivia to get to the castle but little did we know that it only takes you up to like a half way of the hill where the castle is located. We had to walk for what seemed like an eternity but it was all worth it. The view from the \u2026",
          "Beautiful castle on top of the mountain. There is bus or cable car up to the castle. Lack of English signage.",
          "You have a beautiful sight of the surroundings but this fort in itself is not that interesting. You pay 8,4 to get there one direction by cable car or 12,70 return included. Walking back only takes 10 min but then you can have a look in the \u2026",
          "Didn't check out the castel itself too much, but the view from the top was amazing! Great value for the price.",
          "The castle has some interesting exhibitions and well made videos from which I learned a lot about Barcelona's history (which I find very charming). We went at the end of September and we caught the sunset on the roof of the castle exactly \u2026",
          "A nice castle with a great view of the city. Better come before the sunset.",
          "Best place to have an amazing view of the city coastline. Really enjoyed walking through the castle.",
          "Not sure what people expect from a military fort, but I would put this stop in Barcelona high on the list of things to do. The cable car ride offers splendid city views and the mont itself is probably the highest point in the city. In a 100 \u2026",
          "We took the cable lift from down the harbor up the mountain. You exit the lift by a restaurant, and, if it\u2019s 5 o clock somewhere, you can get a pizza and a beer - and enjoy a spectacular view - before continuing your journey. Next we walked \u2026",
          "A panoramic view of Barcelona. A must see and visit when in the city. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Good Place, but lesser of a museum, more of a sight seeing of Barcelona city from up  above. the view is amazing all around it, the light-show and park are its main highlight.",
          "After the cable car trip arrive at the castle an enjoy historical notes and views from ports to marina the castle history and grounds are an moment in Catalan history that should not be missed",
          "A lot of history.  Museum staff can be more helpful  by interacting with Tourists. Their help would have got them a 5 star",
          "Really interesting! I would totally recommend to do the tour and visit places you can't go otherwise! \nThe only criticism I have is safety. They should consider more the people that try to take photos and could fall. There is only one sign \u2026",
          "Such a lovely place with a rich culture and heritage behind it. Very nice place to visit with young children",
          "Great fortress, very well kept. It offers some amazing views of the entire city.",
          "Nice view of Barcelona and Mediterranean Sea. Getting there on foot its good excercise. Using the Cable car to go to the castle might be good if you dont wanna walk but it doesnt star at the bottom and its more expensive that using the bus. Plus while walking there is a lot to experience on the way up.",
          "Really easy access! Great place to check out the light show and waterfall.",
          "Unfortunately the cable cars to the castle were not open due to high winds :( , which was a little disappointing as I am sure this would have added to enormously to our visit, but the castle itself is magnificent and reading the well listed \u2026",
          "A great historical place with impressive architecture!it's a good chance to get to know a few more things about Barcelona and Catalu\u00f1a! Also the view up there its in the top 3 of the whole city! It's worth it to get up there even by walking!",
          "Dose not worth it. But on the way cactus garden is really nice. Unfortunately its closed till 27th March",
          "There are nice views around the castle but ultimately not much to see of the building from the outside.",
          "Beautiful panorama of the city. In my opinion better views than from Park Guel. It is worth to take your with the guide to get on top of the tower",
          "Nice view of the port and the city, its not expencive and its nice to go with the cable car from the city to the castle",
          "Ancient fortress, then prison and now museum, the castle sits on a beautiful spot above the city, with incredible views both inland and towards the sea. Some exhibition are hosted inside the castle but the most spectacular thing is the \u2026",
          "Learn lessons from Scotland. Let people visit historic sites free of charge",
          "History, awe-inspiring views of the Mediterranean Sea and the city of Barcelona, incredible castle architecture, and a fun cable car ride to boot. This was one our favorite Barcelona sites. An experience that is not to be missed!",
          "Lovely place to visit. Need more than one person serving. Could do more with it. Cafes et",
          "Great place to visit and enjoy views and learn about the city history and how it came to be. There is always activities happening so do check in advance for  possibilities.",
          "Very cheap entrance fee - 5 Euro per adult - but very nice view of the Barcelona city from the top of the castle. It is possible to take a full panoramic view of the city from the castle rooftop. Had a great photographic experience. Not much to see in the castle, but great view.",
          "It is one of the best place that you can enjoy the view of both the city and the port. There is a bus that takes you there from Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya. It is a round bus. You get off and on in the same station when you arrive and leave the castle. \u2026",
          "Good view point. You can walk uphill through baeutifull botanical garden and not to pay for the lift. Approximately 15-20 mins uphill.",
          "Exceptional place with great view of port and the city. Very quiet and calm in the evening around 8 pm when the Castle closes.\nVery relaxing place as opposed to city center full of tourists.",
          "It\u2019s located close to downtown and the view is definitely worth it. The cost of general admission is 3\u20ac if you are less than 29 years old so it is affordable. I\u2019d you\u2019re over 29 it\u2019s 5\u20ac.",
          "Great views of the city and sea. Not much to do or see inside the castle otherwise. If you have a lot of time visiting Barcelona I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it (not too expensive, fun views), but if crunched for time it\u2019s one you could skip. The \u2026",

          "There is a lively little bar behind the top, with live music too! Beautiful spot <3",
          "The views from the very top are amazing. It's a breathtaking panorama view of Barcelona, where you can see the Sagrada Familia, the rest of the city, and even the harbor. We came in the winter, so it wasn't very crowded.",
          "The journey to it is more impressive than what you do once you have arrived. Fantastic views over the city but would like to read more of the history than was offer. Still good value , just 5 euros if you have to pay to get in. I liked the view of the port too!",
          "Amazing views and not so busy as other parts of barcelona",
          "This castle was a fun trip our first day in Barcelona. We took the cable cars up the mountain (do this if you do not want to make the hike. the wait for tickets was not long and it was affordable). We walked around the castle grounds, which \u2026",

          "Really nice, great views, there is  along cue to go in, but so nice!",
          "Unbeknownst to me, there is a bus which takes you to the top. I walked from the bottom to the castle which took me a little over an hour. It was pretty and had phenomenal views of the city. Unfortunately it was a bit foggy, can\u2019t have it all \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",
          "Good views, cool cafe atop in the center courtyard and fair priced tickets for how much/little there is to see (3\u20ac for students)",

          "Theres really not much to see here but the view, a few old school cannons and the motes but theres no history listed about them, I had to google the history when I got to a wifi area. The grounds are kept very clean. I had more fun in the \u2026",
          "Super grim! Only democratically elected leader of Europe to be killed here; a distinction held to this day. I\u2019d advise getting the audio guide as there aren\u2019t many plaques to guide you. The inside visitor center was fascinating and provided \u2026",
          "Nice view of Barcelona from the top. But I won\u2019t spend 5\u20ac to enter the castle as there isn\u2019t much interesting things in there. There is free entrance every Sunday after 3pm though if you are curious ;)",

          "Nice place. Fair price for ticket.",
          "\u20ac5 admission or \u20ac3 under 30. Interesting building with a range of walks available to review. Food in cafe was a mix, and the staff could have improved with some manners. Easy to spend an hour here.",
          "A must see for those interested in historic buildings. Beautiful stone and brickwork. Fantastic views on a clear day and a nice walk back down.",
          "The view is very nice. It's money well spent. I highly recommend visiting this place.",

          "There's a fair bit of walking to do but the views are well worth it. Absolutely stunning.",
          "Very nice place. It\u2019s an old fortress that was built around 1756 to protect the city against enemies. It was built surrounding the old watchtower who the first one was built on the top of hill, the year was 1050, to warning Barcino about enemies ships coming from the sea. It cost \u20ac5 to visit and you really can take amazing pics.",
          "Interesting visit. Easily accessible by public transportation.  Walk around the castle for view of porr.",
          "Such nice views.  Great sunset spot",
          "The castle is just average, nothing spectacular. If you want great views of the harbour and the sea, this place is a must good. However, the for view of the city there are better places such as the bunker hill which are 3-4 times better",
          "Beautiful overview of the harbor and the city. Charming history.",
          "Historical landmark, nice for max 1 hour visit I would say. Interesting views to port. Cafe with variety of snacks is there, toilet.\n7 euro combo ticket with botanical garden - be ready to walk to garden for around 25 min down - good views and nature. Garden itself not very well maintained.",
          "It worth to take a ride to the top with the telef\u00e9rico and walk towards the castle. The castle can be visited but you have to pay separately. Isn't expensive, but if you're going in the afternoon, the visit inside the castle take about 45 \u2026",
          "Lovely day visiting. Great views",
          "So much bigger when you get right up to it! Very reasonable admission fee.",

          "Amazing views of Barcelona. Free 1st Sunday of every month",
          "Historical fort on one of the highest points in Barcelona. Can get a good outlook over the city and sea, there's a mini museum about the history of the fort, and some small temporary exhibits.\nEntry fee is low, so it's easily worthwhile, \u2026",
          "In this castle you have beautiful views of Barcelona. Worth place to see",
          "Great experience, here, the history of the place was really interesting and views from the top were excellent!",
          "Nice place to see a spectrum of the coastline especially ships. \nWhen we visited there was a Chinese war art exhibition that was amazing.\nThe crowds aren't many on the weekend we visited\nThe highlight is the cable car ride up the hill to the castle that gives you a 360 aerial view of Barcelona",
          "Thank you for give me a sweet beautiful lovely memory for me in here. Until now I still feel it's just a dream I can be here. This place before is like the front castle in Barcelona to know who will come to this city from the sea. I'm not \u2026",

          "Beautiful place to view the sunset. Entry fee is very cheap. There is a cafe inside . The place was a fortress formerly. One side you can view the whole wide coast and the other the city view. Highly recommended, evenings after 6 would be a better bet.",
          "Interesting, but no matter to take a funicular to go up",
          "Amazing view from the top, many things to see there..it takes time to see everything the best is to go in the afternoon on the daylight. This place have intresting history also!",
          "If you want to get view of Barcelona city its a must visit place. U can reach there by bus. The Castle is maintained well. 5\u20ac entry fees for general. If you opt for audio its 9 \u20ac",
          "We always enjoy coming here. Having been to Barcelona three times, this is still in our itinerary every time. You can see the whole of Barcelona on the top of the castle. If you could, take the cable car to the castle but walk down from the castle afterwards. There are a lot more too see and to discover on your way down.",
          "A spectacular showpiece in Barcelona, highly worth of an evening visit when the musical fountains are on. In other places they may charge \u00a310 for even being there but credit to Catalonians for building and maintaining this fantastic \u2026",

          "Closing times are wrong. We walked all the way up to find they were not letting people in at 5:50 PM despite the closing time of 8:00 PM on the website. All of the gardens were closed on the way up as well. Recommend coming wayyyy early if you want to make it worth it.",
          "don't get me wrong, i recommend Montjuic hill, but not it's castle. imho 5\u20ac entry fee it's not worth the stuff you gonna see!",

          "Not too expensive, and a fascinating look at the history of this fort. Worth it for the views alone.",

          "Historic place.  Do the walk around the castle... It'll last less than 30 mins at normal pace",
          "The Montjuic experience should ideally start with a cable car transfer to the castle, even though public transport in the form of buses are available. Cable car ticket is 12.70 Euros and the entry ticket to the castle costs only 5 euros! \u2026",

          "Great place to visit in Barcelona. Very cheap at 3 euros for the reduced tickets which can be purchased by anyone under 30. It is not very much like a museus, although guided visits in multiple languages are available at certain periods \u2026",
          "High crime area. We parked our rental car on the street by the cable car that takes you to the castle. Upon return to our car we found a rear window smashed. Next we wait at police station for hours to get a simple police report for the rental agency.",

          "Take the gondola during sunset and enjoy !",
          "Picturesque place with amazing view on the city of Barcelona.",
          "Certainly incredible views of the city from atop and you can enjoy even more views by utilizing the cable cars to go up. However, there\u2019s also parking right outside the castle should you choose. While the castle itself is rather simple and lacks informative readings and guides, the architecture and surroundings are still breath taking.",
          "Cool Spanish castle. Ok, Catalan",
          "I highly recommend this castle! We loved exploring the grounds and learning about the history of the castle through our tour guide. I highly recommend participating in a guided tour because you are allowed to enter the dungeons and see the \u2026",

          "Worth a visit if more for the views than the castle itself. My 4 year old loved the brief funicular railway and then the cable cars to get up there. Spectacular views over the city. Modern, clean facilities.",
          "Very beautiful place and breathtaking views of Barcelona. Can get of with the cable car and walk down.   Cable car is not expensive and totally worth it.",
          "Great view and interesting structure. Kids (2-5yo) loved running around and exploring.\nAfter 3 pm addmision was free and with kids it was the perfect amount of time for us to visit.\nArriving is recommended by bus. The fonicular was only once every 30 min. And was not worth the wait.",
          "If your a fan of forts, castles or history then this is a great stop. At only 5\u20ac it\u2019s a great bargain. I was a bit upset that half the displays were closed when I was there. Not sure if it was under maintenance or becauSe I went in an hour \u2026",
          "Nice views on the hike up.  The castle is cool and cheap to get in.  The views were nice in certain areas but others were blocked by trees.  Not much to see in the castle itself. Only do if you are here for awhile.",
          "Brilliant views! Amazing at sunset . Quite a far walk to cable car, I'd get a taxi",
          "Here you will have the best panoramic views from Barcelona. The castle is very well renovated and taken care of. Its quiet and a good place to just sit and enjoy the view.",

          "Free on the first Sunday of the month! That was a pleasant surprise!",
          "Great experience, the only bas things if you don\u2019t have a motorbike or car might be a bit tiring going all the way up and down when the movie might finish around midgnight, wear something warm might get cool on the night. Great experience! You can bring your food and drinks and chairs !",
          "This wasn't really worth the price because the view isn't really that great since you're facing an industrial part of Barcelona and you get a much better view at some higher up points in the Guell park. Also, the only thing that is inside is a caffe with terrible service and mediocre (or nasty) food.",
          "Went there for sunset in August and the castle was closing. However got some great views of Barcelona city and port .It is a lovely  walk around the perimeter which takes about 25 minutes. The cable car up to the castle is a short 5 minute ride .",
          "Very majestic, amazing views all around, small cafe for a bite, parking outside. Cable car access for better views and transport up and down, not recommended to walk up and back down, especially on a hot day.",

          "Absolutely stunning. Really enjoyed it. You can take pictures & doesn't cost much to go around.",
          "It has a beautiful view of Barcelona. It is a 30 minute walk from the Palau Nacional so you can make some exercise. It was the perfect timing for us because we could see the sunset and a 360 degree view of the city. I didn't pay anything to get in. Maybe because it was Sunday. There is a public bus (150) that has a stop there.",
          "castle is not that great. but the view around the place is amazing",
          "We went ther with the cable car from the seaside. It was amazing. The castle is not a big attraction bit the view is wonderful from the top. We went home on foot down the hill, and there are a plenty of attractions and parks on the way to be worth a stop.",

          "The views are stupendous! Opt for the guided tour",
          "Took the cable car to the top so had a look around. Free to enter on the day we went (Sunday). Not the most impressive of sites but lots of good history about the castle made it a worthwhile trip. PLUS the views from up and around the area across the city make it well worth the trip",
          "Wonderful place especially the height of it where u can see the city and the see",

          "A place needed to visit in Barcelona to know a little bit more about its history.",
          "Fantastic views. It is a nice trip to make, perhaps not on a very hot day and not with very young children. The location is a part of a riute for The city tour bus. It is the most convenient mean of transportation, I think. You may want to \u2026",
          "Wonderful history and very well communicated via information boards and video. Refreshments are distinctly average. Worth the trip for the amazing views over the city and waterfront.",
          "Great place to visit with a beautiful view on the port and the city. Although it may seem a bit empty at the moment in tine there are exhibitions and events planned. Four stars for me, mostly for vast, empty and unused spaces inside the garrison and moat areas.",

          "Beautiful view on city and port. Very nice walk on castle. You can take also a gondola lift. But if you are in good shape I really recommend a walk up, because is super nice.

          "Great walk up, worth the view over all Barcelona including harbour etc",
          "Historical castle in Barcelona located on the top of the highest hill of the city. Undoubtedly, the best view in Barcelona! You can get there and get back by cable railway \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb.",

          "I like history and visiting historic sites. This place was nice and gave a great view of Barcelona. The price was affordable; I liked how we can go at our own pace. FYI, if you go in the morning, you will get that ocean air and by ocean air I mean an odor that smells like something died and is crawling towards you.",
          "Accessed by walking through some lovely shaded gardens, and then you get amazing views across the city and harbour. Lots of great photo opps",
          "Amaizing when the sun is seting down. Deffineatly worth the ticket",
          "The castle is not big one, but opens a beautiful view on Barcelona and sea. You can up there by walking, dont spend money for funicular. Entrance fee is 5 euro",

          "Great views of the port and city.",
          "Beautiful views and cheap entrance fee (5\u20ac or 3\u20ac for reduced). Can get here from city centre by taking Metro to Paral-lel, then funicular up (which is part of metro system so 48hr passes will be valid ). Then option to take cable to the castle or the bus..",
          "Can't say it's in my top 5 castle list history wise but definitely it offers an amazing view of Barcelona and surroundings. To get there use the cable car. If you are on budget just take it one way (up, I recommend) and then you can walk on \u2026",
          "More than enough time to walk around on top of the highest hills of Barcelona. \nAfter high season, especially in autumn and winter it can be chilly or even cold during the winter. So remember yourself to take with you a coat during these seasons.",
          "After taking the Telef\u00e9rico all the way up to this castle, we found out the best Views are actually from up there. The castle has lots of history and you can see it as soon as you get there. Walking around was easy and there were some interesting spots up there. We loved it!",
          "Some great views of the city, and a nice walk around the grounds.  Not much else was very interesting...",

          "The views over the port and the town are impressive. It\u2019s well worth a visit but unless you\u2019re planning on enjoying a long walk around it\u2019s a visit that will last only a couple of hours. The cafe is great and the facilities are clean and at \u2026",

          "Nice panorama to the sea, and to the city.",
          "Beautiful ride upro catstle but the actual castle was a little disappointing.... you simply walk around the outside of the castle and thats about it. There are several weapons and a watchtower to view but it was nothing special. Siggest doing the guided tour if you do go",
          "A Must Visit place in Barcelona....Outstanding highly maintained just loved it \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Amazing castle on the top of the Montju\u00efc mount. The view is incredible.\nWe were blessed with a sunny day and no clouds, which allowed us to see all Barcelona and surroundings.\nAccess to the Castle is just 5 euros, there is a cafeteria \u2026",
          "It's pretty, good place to take pictures, not a must. Entry to the castle and museum costs money, but not that much. Being outside is free though ;)",
          "\u20ac3 concession price made it worth it to go in. Not much in the castle however, it does offer a great vantage point over Barcelona. I would highly recommend taking the cable car up since it is a very steep walk, which does make it quite challenging with the heat. Certainly worth it though.",
          "You can take cable car from in the near of metro station Paral Lel. You should look for Funicular Monjuic. If you use Barcelona City Pass there is option to have tocket fro this cable car included. Also you can walk trough beautiful \u2026",

          "Nice experience visit with nice view on Barcelona city side and Barcelona port, I reached it by telefric",
          "Nothing much to see or do there. On top it has a great view of all the city.",
          "Nice place , very nice view",
          "Because I'm under 29 years old I got a discount, this price (3 euros) was worth the view. Nothing else. You can get a good view for free. They have pints of beer for a decent price though up on the terras.",
          "Great views and a fun little walk-about. My only complaint is that the lines were too long at the cafe and there wasn't enough seating. I would recommend they open a second cafe!",
          "Small. Could be be done in 30 minutes. Maybe to one hour if you're really a fan.",
          "this place had a great view of the city once you reached the castle. there is also the option to do the cable taxi not sure if that is what its called but yeah. great area!",
          "I've seen more impressive castles and fortresses, but this was also nice and definitely worth visiting. You can walk around freely and the view is also beautiful. Great place to take photo's and see some history at the same time. If you're a fan of impressive fortresses or history, this is certainly a place to visit!",
          "We have awesome view of port and city it has good history behind",
          "Best views of Barcelona. Recommend the Teleferic de Montjuic cable car (don't confuse with port cable car) up to the castle - however can be confusing to get to the cable car. Don't let that put you off though! Great trip!",

          "Beautiful place.  Beautiful panorama of the city .. I spent about four hours and I'm going back",
          "The views of the city and coast not spectacular as the site is not located high enough. The castle itself is quite large but otherwise just like most military posts.",
          "Incredible place to relax",
          "A good place to see entire city",
          "Very well preserved military castle. Mutlimedia installations along the way helps understanding the story of the castle. At the terrace you can enjoy stunning views from the city and nearby the castle there are other very interesting attractions to visit as well. I recommend you take an entire day to visit the area.",
          "The view from the top is really good... And for the castle.... I have always loved castles",

          "The funicular was not working today but a bus was provided to take anyone interested most of the way up.  You can walk through nice gardens and visit the castle. \nAfter the castle there are many places around just outside the castle walls to get viewpoints around Barcelona.",
          "The views are absolutely worth the trek! We hiked up to the castle from Olympic park, swung through the botanical garden, enjoyed the sites at the castle, explored their thought provoking exhibits, and then ride the cable car down. A great way to spend the afternoon in Barcelona.",
          "The castle is huge but you can go all around in the less than an hour. Amazing views from the towers to the port.",

          "Great views. Ticket system could do with an overall.",
          "The Castle is great! But why is there no exhibition about it? This Castle has such a great history, as far as i can tell; so tell me more!",
          "Very good place for spend some time in Barcelona. Big advantages is the price, normal is 6 euro and reduces ticket is 3 euro and this is for all people under 30 years old.",
          "A museum with a bit of history would be nice. Great views and access to most of the fort though.",

          "Historical settlement from the 1600s built on the top of Montjuic mountain that was used through the centuries either to protect the city or to control the citizens (was conquered many times by different aggresors). The museum inside \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a real fortress from the middle ages with a superb view of Barcelona towards the mountains and towards the sea and its port. Well maintained and makes for wonderful pictures.

          "Amazing castle with really amazing views on Barcelona city and port. Nice piece of history to visit.",
          "The trip up montju\u00efc is the best part. A beautiful walk in nice weather, but I'd recommend the cable car instead. It gives you great views and a quicker experience as it is a long walk. \nThe castle is beautiful, but unless you're interested in the history of it... it's not worth going in to see except for the view from the top.",
          "Great piece of history. Worth checking out. Amazing views of the city.",
          "Good overview of the port below and the city. Nothing much to see in the castle itself.",
          "The view from the castle is amazing and the castle itself is really good. You can learn about its history and see how it is from inside. The only issue is on how you will get there. Apart from that, it worths a visit",

          "Great city views, lots of history here",
          "Great location to have a overview of the city even you don't get into the castle. It was also a nice experience to climb all the way up to the castle because you will be able to pass by a lot interesting places.\n\nIn general the area is quite natural and well planned city green space.",
          "Excellent views and history. Highly recommend the guided tour. The view from the watchtower alone is worth the price of admission!",

          "Under 30 years age cost 3 EURO. View is nice but nothing more should be expected.",

          "We took the cable car from the beach in Barcelona, (11 Euro one way, 16 euro both directions) followed by a moderately steep 25 minute walk up to the castle. Outside there are the usual collection of opportunist people hawking their wares. \u2026",
          "Nice little side trip.  Take the cable car up and you can walk down.  Priced decently 14 euro for round trip.  The fort uptop is cool but a little boring.",

          "Not a lot to see when the castle is closed. I guess it's worth a visit to visit the musem but otherwise, don't go",
          "Great mirador, park, and trail were there. Only down side is that you will have only one bus to get there and you should come back to where you came from. There isn't any buses to the downtown so you should walk 30 mins to the harbourfront or La Rambla.",
          "Nice castle with pretty good view over the Barcelona beach area, the seaport and also the city in the other directions. The castle itself is not so interesting. But entry is cheap so you can go there to look around the Barcelona area.",

The ticket is very cheap to enter inside castle . You can even go by cable car to this place. Must visit place in Barcelona.",
          "Excelent place, nice weather and a little people. Marina is great.",

          "Great time. One major understanding is theres 2 different gondolas to go to the top be away of this. One from the port and one from half way point. You can also cab or bus amost to the top with a little walk. The Montjuic Castle is awesome give yourself so time to explorer it.",
          "Beautifully kept, gardens are also a nice touch. Walking paths are a bit tough for those with walking limitations.",
          "It's a must see. Take the local bus or tram based on your preference. Amazing view of the city from the top. There is not much in the castle but on a good day worth spending a couple of hours.",
          "Once you have made it up the Montjuic hill crowning it you will find the historic Montjuic fort / castle which is well worth the 5 euros entrance fee\nThis old fort which its gun batteries still in place is an impressive sight and has beautiful flowerbeds surrounding it in the moat",
          "Great view of the city of Barcelona. Perfect atmosphere. Very nice if you visit it when the sun is going down. The castle is accessible if you pay a small fee. But it is worth doing it.",
          "Nice place to kill a few hours. There's a possibility to learn something about Barcelona's past. Also good for views over the city. Easy stroll back to the city through green area.",
          "Relatively ok castle, but excellent view...must see",
          "Good views of the city but not that great. Nothing else much up there. Gondola was good. Have to pay to get in to castle as well as gondola",
          "Well preserved castle but the views over the city are a hidden gem. Walking around the castle you can come close to some huge cannons. As you can see I arrived there quite late too see the castle's museum but the scenery was mesmerising. Locals come there for a peaceful walk or jogging.",

          "One of the nicer areas of Barcelona!",
          "Awesome place. Breathtaking views. Come here and be prepared to walk a lot. And depending on how much time you have you can spend 2-6 hours exploring.",
          "Great views from the top of the castle. Not the most interesting castle in Europe, but the cable car trip to the top and the 360 degrees views of Barcelona are great",
          "Great view on the city.",
          "A popular tourist attraction with a grat view of the city and the port. Exhibits focus on Catalan fight for independence and the political tension between the Spanish Crown and Catalunia as an emerging democratic republic. Not many rooms to \u2026",
          "Really worth a visit here. Stunning views and cool things to see.",
          "How to reach?\nTake bus 150 from Pla\u00e7a Espanya.\n\nIs there entry fees?\nYes there is little entry fees.\nReduced price: 3\u20ac (below 29 years)\nRegular price: 5\u20ac (30+ years)\n\nWhat to do?\nFrom here, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of city coast. And also the city.",
          "One of the most beautiful experiences. A beautiful castle, a lot of history and lots of things to learn . We loved it. Although we spent a whole day there and saw every corner of it ,we will definitely go again. You have a beautiful view of Barcelona from the top and it's uplifting.",
          "It's... Pretty good. The problem is that the whole thing is big, but there really isn't a lot going on. It's cheap to get in however. There are many steps and no escalators or lifts, so it's really unsuitable for mobility impaired visitors.",
          "Its beautiful to visit but you don\u2019t really have to pay, just take a walk around and its fine. If you do want to go inside, there\u2019s not much to see, and it costs 10\u20ac, 5\u20ac if you are a student. The view of the port is great, tough.",

          "Spectacular views across the city and the sea.",
          "Nice views of Barcelona, but not much else.",
          "They wouldn't let us in because we had hired electric scooters. Even though we promised not to ride them, they wouldn't let us enter. Still had a great time walking around the outside of the grounds and absorbing the views of the city below.",
          "Been to plenty of castles in Europe and this is one of the best. The views are truly spectacular, an amazing value for \u20ac5. Easy to get to on the 150 Bus. Plan at least 2 hours and up to half a day if you want. A must-visit in Barcelona.",
          "If you're interested in historic places then you shouldn't miss Montju\u00efc. The place has a lot of stories to tell and you'll have a nice view of Barcelona as a bonus. And while you're at it, watch the sunset. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Not much to see... just the view from the whole city",
          "Nice place and great view, but it should be free, pay 3 euros as a student for that is way too much",
          "Historic place, nice views and a piece of history about Barcelona and the spanish civil war",
          "The entire park is just amazing! Be prepared, though, to walk up the steep hill if you decide to reach it on foot. I would recommend you definitely take the fonicular on the way up, the view of Barcelona is fantastic. The castle itself is very basic, but you should not miss the view from the castle on a sunny day.",
          "Amazing view, definitely worth going up for just that. The exhibition was informative but the topic is obviously one of the harder ones. We really appreciate the good quality coffee at the caf\u00e9 and the super clean rest room.",
          "Must visit . Beautiful castle near the shore",
          "Beautiful.. Worth the View Alone.!!",
          "Montju\u00efc Castle was built in 1640 at the top of Montju\u00efc Hill and became a military museum, paying for of course, in the 20th century.",

          "Great experience I'm glad I got to see this historical castle. Amazing view it's a must see if your ever in Barcelona.",
          "Once you get to the top, the views are stunning. The castle is kept very well and there are many exhibitions to see, some pictures and some videos. Who knew about the dark history of the castle?! Slight disappointment on the food but I guess you have to pay a heavy premium for the location.",
          "Cheap admission, great views",
          "Panorama view of the city and the port. Much less crowded than other attractions in the city.",
          "Really nice place to visit with a great view of the city",
          "Unless you are in decent shape I recommend taking the funicular to the top. It connects from the metro station. The rest of the walk about 1KM is pleasant and green. It's free and the views are spectacular! Great way to just hang and enjoy city views!",
          "Not to be missed. If it's sunny, even better",
          "Fantastic pint ,good service and reasonably priced",
          "Pretty amazing views from the top. Castle is definitely worth the visit. \n\nGenerally, you don't have to pay for the overpriced funicular to get to Montjic. Regular bus with regularly priced tickets goes to the top as well. \nGoing down we walked and it was quite quick.",
          "Can't access much but totally free if you walk from the base and don't catch bus/gondola. Stunning views on clear day. Worth the trip for view of city and walk around exterior of buildings. Nice bar/eatery at top but sort of pricey. We \u2026",
          "Rather modern fortress on top of Montjuic. Great views of Barcelona and the ocean. Overlooks the container harbour also if you find that interesting. We took a taxi up to the castle and walked down through the park. Access is free on \u2026",
          "Fantastic views of the entire city of Barcelona, also fun to watch the port operating from high above.  The castle is accessible for a small fee and has many interesting historical exhibits about the castle.  Was well worth the few hours we \u2026",
          "Panoramic view to the whole city and the sea.",
          "Arriving at the castle with 21 students aged 13, who after a long hike up the hill were not allowed to use the toilets, unless we paid admittance to the castle. That was a bit surprising.",
          "Amazing castle with lots of history. Worth a good walk up to it or you can take the cable car or bus. Beautiful 360 degree views of Barcelona and the sea.",
          "Great historic picturesque view from castle and surrounds on the 'mountain'. Fantastic out and back run from the cruise ship harbour along various paths and walkways thru gardens and trees.",
          "Great view of barcelona",
          "Historic site with a nice walking trail around the Castle.",
          "A fortress built up high up for a defensive position. Great outdoor space and museum. This location also offers wonderful city views.",
          "Great way to see the whole city! Take the funicular up to the castle it is cheap and comfortable (you don\u2019t even have to breakdown the stroller). Up there there are magnificent views of the entire city of Barcelona. They r better than tibidabo cause it\u2019s less cold. Great place to have the kids run around and enjoy a castle.",
          "Well done museum and great views from the castle. The caf\u00e9 is very expensive and very slow",
          "What a view! You love Barcelona and then you love it more!",
          "Great view! And nice architecture! I would expect more rooms to be open with more history inside",
          "It's the must have place to be at Barcelona. There is a great overview to the city and its harbor, you will check locations of the major attractions. Must to be visited!",
          "Very relaxing place and if you like castles this one is good. The cafe sells limited food, so I'd talk a picnic as there's some stunning views of the city.",
          "Great views of Barcelona. Only 3-5 Euro entrance for basic fee. They have a deposit locker so you don't have to carry things around. The walk through the park is okay, but there is the T150 bus that runs very near the top. Not a lot of information panels but some. Might be worth the guided tour for the additional 4 euro.",
          "Excellent place to learn about the turbulent history of the proud Catalonian people.",
          "Great view, not worth the entre fee...",
          "A must visit for some nice views of the city.",
          "A must visit to understand the history of Barcelona. Not expensive and revealing. Great views from the castle and pleasant strolling or hiking around. Count 1 to 3 hours.",
          "Wonderful place, you definitely should come here, though it is quite hard to walk there or ride the bike on top of the hill. But definitely you would get some fantastic photos from there. Take a ticket to the fortress and walk around the \u2026",
          "It\u2018s a nice place .. you reach here by the Telfrik is much better and easier",
          "The place is good. Has a good view of the sea. However, the view of the city is blocked in parts by some trees. But considering it was free for the castle (I think it is free on Sunday after 3PM or so) and that we did not have any waiting time for the cable car, I am giving it a 5 star rating.",
          "Nice view to the sea.",
          "Another interesting place in Barcelona. Of cause it's recommended to visit. The Castel have also old history and very nice view on Barcelona. The entrance was also quite cheap.",
          "Definitely worth visiting. Great place to see the panorama of the port and El Prat airport on one side and the city with Sagrada Familia on the other. Entrance is 5 euro for adult. I recommend to get there by bus 150 that stops 150m form the castle instead of cable car. The best view you get from the castle eitherway.",
          "They actually allowed us entrance for free because we are Egyptians. Nice historical site.",
          "Love this Castle. To all Filipino visiting Barcelona should visit this place. Jose Rizal, A hero and martyr of the war of independence were once locked up here",
          "We had planned one or two hours here but spent nearly the entire day here.\nBuy a skyway ticket to get to her castle, then buy the Castle entrance once you get up the mountain.\nYou can just ride the sky way up and back down but you would miss out on a well laid out encounter.\nPublic restrooms here. Museum and views of Barcelona.",
          "I would say this is more of a fortress than a castle in the truest sense of the word. It was an ok experience, great views and after 3:00pm on a Sunday it's free which was a bonus. The metro takes you up to the Parc Montjuic and then get a 150bus to the castle",
          "Totally worth a visit. This citadel is well preserved and offers a very nice vantage point over the city. There is a cable car to do the last few hundreds meters instead of walking but we thought it wasn\u2019t worth paying the 12 Euros return ticket as you only shave a short distance to the top with it",
          "Has been changed since 2013... can\u2019t get up the castle for sightseeing of sunset. The castle closes at 6pm before sunset. It was most beautiful scenery of sunset I\u2019ve ever seen from the top of the castle but I can\u2019t enjoy it anymore... so sad\ud83d\ude25",
          "A big piece of history.",
          "There is a video display right after you buy tickets that tells you the history of the castle which is really interesting but other than that, there's not much except for the view from the fort. Was it worth the 3 euros per person? Meh. \u2026",
          "Awesome vibes up here!!",
          "Go inside and see the tour. They do an excellent job with some different ways to see how it's been used through the years. The castle itself isn't that exciting",
          "What a beautiful place to be. Just go up there and explore the castle and the great view over Barcelona and the big harbour on the other side. We get up with the cable railway and it's worth the ride. Not very crowded and with good weather a perfect must do when in barca. We really had a lot of fun. Thanks.",
          "Very good place!",
          "Do not miss this outing while visiting Barcelona. Especially recommendable are the funicular ride, the visit to the Castle and the views of the sea and the Port.\nThe castle has some great views across the city. Also we thought the Olympic \u2026",
          "Every Sunday of begging of each month entrance is free. \nOne of the nice Castle to visit and landscape from it is amazing I love it a lot I usually go there every month and take with me some food and sit there eat and watch and relaxing the \u2026",
          "Great place to have panoramic view of Barcelona!!",
          "So magical! It's a must if you visit Barcelona! Don't miss it",
          "Turns out it was free entry past 3pm. Otherwise stunning views and interesting history as well as a great hike up!",
          "Fabulous!!! Full of history and stories and really good exhibits. Lots of walking so not really for the less mobile. There are lifts but not everywhere. Really enjoyable and the views from the top of the Castell is awesome. Highly recommended.",
          "Great journey on cable car. ...fantastic views towards the sea",
          "Interesting historical place, also offering great views of the city and the port.",
          "The museum and the castle itself might not be a top attraction but the city overview is simply  magnificent!",
          "Great view of the city ONLY WITHIN THE CASTLE. If you plan on going for the view prepare to pay for it.  Take the metro then the bus up. All other options don't appear sensible.",
          "When you visit the fort, then make you want to play game like Total War Napoleons or Age Of Empire.",
          "Do yourself a favor and book the guided tour, amazing information shared with tour.",
          "Awesome castle, interesting history. Would have like a little more signage with info.",
          "Nice experience with very good options for photography.\nTip: If you go there on Sunday afternoon then tickets are free. Otherwise entry fee is 7 euros per adult and 4 euros per kid.",
          "Beautiful place, must visit",
          "The panoramic views of Barcelona are stunning! The visitor centre and exhibition are interesting, and the cafe a welcome stop for a cup of tea. A highlight of our trip.",
          "Beautiful environment to take a walk and relax.",
          "Great views from up top. If you get the cable car make sure to get off at (or walk down to) the Mirador stop. Great views of Barcelona and the harbour to be had.",
          "A great place to relive a bit of history, and to be grateful for our good life in modern times!",
          "If I have another opportunity to visit Barcelona, I think I would most likely also go see this again. It isn't really one of the great European castles such as those seen in e.g. France or Germany, it is a fortress with fairly modern \u2026"

        "wiki": "The Parc de la Ciutadella (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8pa\u027e\u0261 d\u0259 l\u0259 siwt\u0259\u02c8\u00f0e\u028e\u0259]; \"Citadel Park\") is a park on the northeastern edge of Ciutat Vella, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. For decades following its creation in the mid-19th century, this park was the city's only green space. The 70-acre (280,000 m2) grounds include the city zoo (once home to the albino gorilla Snowflake, who died in 2003), the Palau del Parlament de Catalunya, a small lake, museums, and a large fountain designed by Josep Fontser\u00e8 (with possible contributions by the young Antoni Gaud\u00ed).\nAs the location of the Parliament of Catalonia, the tensions in 2018 and 2019 regarding Catalan independence regularly led to the police closure of the park to public access to prevent crowds forming near to the official buildings.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n=== Citadel ===\n\nIn 1714, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Barcelona was laid siege for 13 months by the army of Philip V of Spain. The city fell, and in order to maintain control over it, and to prevent the Catalans from rebelling as they had in the previous century, Philip V built the citadel of Barcelona, at that time the largest fortress in Europe.\nA substantial part of the district it was constructed in (La Ribera) was destroyed to obtain the necessary space, leaving its inhabitants homeless. The fortress was characterized by having five corners, which gave the citadel defensive power, and by a rather wide surrounding margin, serving as location for the army's cannons. It included enough buildings to house 8,000 people.\nHundreds of Catalans were forced to work on the construction for three years, while the rest of the city provided financial backing for this and for warfare-related expenses as well, with a new tax named el cadestre. Three decades later a quarter was rebuilt around the fortress named Barceloneta, which is located inside the neighborhood Ciutat Vella.\nIn 1841 the city's authorities decided to destroy the fortress, which was hated by Barcelona's citizens. Yet two years later, in 1843, under the regime of Maria Cristina, the citadel was restored. In 1848, after Maria Cristina's abdication and as the citadel lost its use, General Espartero razed most of the buildings within the fortress as well as its walls by bombarding it from the nearby mountain fortress Montjuic, which helped him gain political popularity. By 1869, as the political climate liberalised enough to permit it, General Prim decided to turn over what was left of the fortress to the city and some buildings were demolished under Catalan orders, for it was viewed as by the citizens as a much-hated symbol of central Spanish government.\nThe chapel (now the Military Parish Church of Barcelona), the Governor's palace (now Verdaguer Secondary School), and the arsenal (now home to the Catalan Parliament) remain, with the rest of the site being turned into the contemporary park by the architect Josep Fonts\u00e9re in 1872. Nineteen years later, in 1888, Barcelona held the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona extravaganza, inspired by Mayor Rius i Taulet, and the park was redesigned with the addition of sculptures and other complementary works of art. This marked the conclusion of the old provincial and unprogressive Barcelona and the establishment of a modern cosmopolitan city. From that point until 1892, half of the park's layout was enhanced again in order to obtain sufficient space for the zoo. The park's bandstand, Glorieta de la Transsexual S\u00f2nia, is dedicated to a transsexual, Sonia Rescalvo Zafra, who was murdered there on 6 October 1991 by right-wing extremists.\n\n\n=== Cascada ===\n\nThe Cascada (waterfall or cascade in Spanish) is located at the northern corner of the park opposite to the lake. It was first inaugurated in 1881 without sculptures or any meticulous details, and was thereby criticized by the press, after which this triumphal arch was thoroughly amended by the addition of a fountain and some minor attributes, which required six years of construction from 1882 to 1888, and was thenceforth put on display at the Universal Exhibition, and hitherto not been redesigned. It was erected by Josep Fonts\u00e9re and to a small extent by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, who at that time was still an unknown student of architecture. Fonts\u00e9re aimed to loosely make it bear resemblance to the Trevi Fountain of Rome. Two enormous pincers of gigantic crabs serve as stairs to access a small podium located in the centre of the monument. In front of it a sculpture (designed by Venanci Vallmitjana) of Venus standing on an open clam was placed. The whole cascade is divided in two levels. From the podium on a path leads to the Feminine Sculpture and to the northeastern corner of the park, and upon following the route down the stairs the fountain's pond is rounded and the southern tip of the artifact is  reached.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe zoo of Barcelona is located in the park of the ciutadella due to the availability of a few buildings which were left empty after the Universal Exposition of 1888. It was inaugurated in 1892, during the day of the Merc\u00e9, the patron saint of the city. The first animals were donated by Llu\u00eds Mart\u00ed i Codolar to the municipality of Barcelona, which gratefully approved of their accommodation in the zoo. Nowadays, with one of the most substantial collections of animals in Europe, the zoo affirms that their aim is to conserve, investigate, and educate.From 1966 to 2003 the zoo was home to the famous albino gorilla Snowflake, who attracted many international tourists and locals.  Apart from the usual visits, different types of guided tours or other activities are offered, like for example 20  types of diversionary workshops, excursions and fieldtrips for schoolchildren, or personnel training and educational courses in zoology for adults. More than 50,000 children visit the zoo on an annual basis, which is the reason for the zoo's emphasis on education.\n\n\n=== Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona ===\n\nThe Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona comprises a museum of zoology and a museum of geology, both sited in the park, but also other science facilities elsewhere in Barcelona. The Museu Martorell (the Geology Museum) was administrated by the city of Barcelona from 1882 to 2010. The Museum of Zoology was administrated by the city from 1920 to 2010. Both museums are closed for the moment as the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona is planning new functions for them.\nThe Castle of the Three Dragons was constructed for the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona (1888) by the architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e9nech i Montaner to serve as an exhibition. Most of the building is constructed of red brick. Later, in 1920, it reopened as the museum of zoology. In the time when the museum was opened to the public, the most popular displays were the skeleton of a whale and exhibits dedicated for children. It also kept valuable collections from the animal kingdom; urban birds; and an apiary. The institute's stated aims were to enhance knowledge and conservation of the natural diversity of Catalonia and its surroundings, to promote public education on the natural world, to transmit ethical values of respect for nature, and to stimulate informed debate on the issues and environmental problems that concern society.\nThe geology museum had permanent exhibitions on the subject of mineralogy, petrology and paleontology; the volcanic region of Olot; minerals' secret colors. Its collections are a legacy of the scientist Francisco Martorell i Pe\u00f1a (1822\u20131878), who donated his whole collection of artifacts of cultural and archeological importance, his scientific library, and an amount of 125,000 pesetas to the city for the purpose of creating a new museum. The building, built during the same year and named the Corporaci\u00f3n Municipal, was designed by Antoni Rivas i Trias.\n\n\n=== Als Voluntaris Catalans ===\nThe history of sculpture, a bronze nude of a young man with arms raised, dates back to 1918 when it was agreed to erect a monument to the Catalan volunteers killed on the battlefield under the Allied flags. The work was commissioned to Josep Clar\u00e0 and its execution can be followed in the minutes of the municipal plenaries of the time. In 1923 the sculptor had already finished the monument, but the arrival to power of Primo de Rivera paralyzed the project. Francoist Spain made impossible to celebrate any public act of Catalan self-determination, so the inauguration had to be postponed for thirteen years. Initially, it was considered to place the work in the Lesseps square between the street of the Bishop Morgadas and the one of Septiman\u00eda but finally it was located in the park of the Ciutadella where it has remained until today.\nThe sculpture was subject of violations in Francoist Spain. On the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress, in 1952, the monument was hidden by a huge screen. In December 1952 the statue's arms were cut off, so it was covered again with a box until its restoration. In 1954 the brass arms were restored and the young man's genitals got hidden with a vine leaf. The personal notes of the file of Clar\u00e0 allow to follow in detail the displeasure of the sculptor about  the treatment of his work.\nOn the 75th anniversary of its inauguration, the shameful vine leaf has been removed, thus recovering the original nude that allows us to enjoy the work of Clar\u00e0 as it was sculpted, in a new location on the shallow bank of the lake.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe Barcelona Metro and Trambes\u00f2s station Ciutadella-Vila Ol\u00edmpica, on L4, is named after the park and the nearby area Vila Ol\u00edmpica. The entrance to the park, however, is closer to the metro and Rodalies Barcelona (commuter train network) station Arc de Triomf. The city's central bus station Estaci\u00f3 del Nord is also close.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarcelona\u2019s Main City Park: Parc de la Ciutadella on Homage to BCN",

          "Another stop on our bike tour of Barcelona bought us from the Arc de Triomf to this park and in particular the excellent water feature which is impressive in both size and appearence and I'm surprised more isn't made of it. The bike tour stopped here for a few minutes and even",
          "This park is lovely for a stroll - it's not particularly big but it is picturesque. I love the parakeets throughout and the central fountain. On a sunny day its a nice place to while away an hour or two.",
          "We love this park it\u2019s really big and as it\u2019s a bit out of the main part of the city it seem to be more used by local Spanish than tourists. You could spend a whole day there there\u2019s a couple of lakes one of them you can rent boats another one with beautiful Fountains you can",
          "We came across this park purely by chance having visited Arc De Triomf. It is a beautiful park full of hidden surprises. A peaceful park to walk around. The best, surprising part was the Cascada, a beautiful waterfall with golden statues. Well worth a visit especially for",
          "This is a very large park which includes Barcelona Zoo. Perfect for sitting and gently wandering around. There is a nice boating lake and a short walk up is an attractive arch.",

          "Took a walk with my family to the park and amazed at the gorgeous fountain. It is quite a long walk from Las Ramblas where we stayed , and the fountain is even further in the entrance where we thought it would be. Dont even think of not taking a picture of the fountain. It's a",
          "Me and my partner enjoyed a walk around the park and stopped at a food place just outside the Zoo, nice pannini and a cold beer. I noticed a guy laying on the grass, it was obvious this man had no fixed abode and had a mental health issue (torrents) he appeared harmless enough",
          "A very nice vast park, perfect for strolling around, run, bike through it, if you like that kind of things. The fountain is pretty beautiful.The zoo is right next to it, did not have a change to visit it (maybe next time!)",
          "Nice park near the beach. You can spend time here driving bike, walking or just sitting on the grass and enjoy in the Sun. Zoo is also here, amazing lake where you can rent a boat. Amazing architecture anf fountain.",
          "Worst park in the city. Has trash, litter, dried grass, and DOZENS of pickpockets. The only thing worth seeing is the fountain, which is off half the day. Groups of pickpockets hang around and ask tourists to sign a \u201cpetition\u201d. After you sign, they demand to see your ID to",
          "We went here a couple of times as walking distance (kind of) from our AirBnB. It was a bit rainy and thus a bit mussy here and there. Would love to come in sunny wather. A lot to see and explore in the large park and the acro de trionfo is always worth a picture",
          "This wasn\u2019t a must see on our list and honestly we only went there because we were in the area and at that point couldn\u2019t even remember what it was but we really enjoyed it. It is a massive, towering monument/water fountain with life-size sculptures of horses and people.",
          "really nice park if you don\u2019t like busy tourist areas. absolutely stunning water feature. it does smell very strongly of weed in some parts so probably wouldn\u2019t take my family here",

          "A lovely park with a grand water feature that is in the heart of Barcelona. It is definitely worth a visit, even if you walk from one side to the other to the other to get across the city. Near the fountain there are some interesting sculptures",
          "Beautiful park to spend sometimes walking around. Watch out for the guy with the coconuts near the fountain. He is trying to scam you JUST SAY NO A IGNORE HIM. Otherwise this is a beautiful must see",
          "This is an awesome Barcelona treasure. The Parc has everything from a small lake that rents boats, cool architecture, gardens, fountains and even a zoo. On the outside of the Parc you can find quite a few good dining choices as well. The better part of a day could be spent",

          "This site can easily be reached by metro.The name of the station stop is Arc de Triomf. Right outside the station is the Arch which is gorgeous with the park in the front. At the end of the park, just cross the street and go left, people will enter the Parc de la Ciutadella",
          "We came across the beautiful fountain in this park by accident, as we were just walking around the area, and thought we'd take a detour. It was so lovely, lots of locals just enjoying the outdoors, ducks, turtles etc in the ponds and fresh air, One thing we didn't know was",

          "wonderful green space with an absolutely beautiful fountain. Plenty of shade for relaxing and people watching, escape the tourist hoards and just relax for a couple of hours.",
          "We visited it as part of our time to relax and entertain the kids. The fountain is beautiful, the lake is greenish and a bit dump. The toilets are chemicals only, so don`t expect luxury. It's green, there are a lot of benches and seller of all kind of stuff",
          "I believe this park comes from an international expo. There are very grand 19th Century building all around and some lovely landscaping, especially palms. But some of it is dusty and needs care and there are not many flowers. Lots of folks hanging around without much to do.",

          "We stopped at this park as part of a bike tour, but it looked like a nice destination to visit for its own sake. The highlight for us was the beautiful Gaudi-designed fountain, but we also enjoyed the many shade trees (it was a hot afternoon!) and the mammoth statue. Strolling",
          "A great visit to the park this morning, strolling through and exploring. The lakes, the fountains, the mammoth!! And lots of other lovely things. I think my favourite thing was the green parakeets!! I think the children liked the play areas, although they were intended for",

          "This park is on the East side of the City and we used it to get away from all the people and shops and just enjoy some greenery, sounds of the birds and a few park benches to rest on. The park is not far from the zoo. A couple of the signs in the park were too faded to read",
          "Parc de la Ciutadella located on the east side of Barcelona near (La Barceloneta Beach), getting to this area by Metro will be quite ok. There are few exits that i have listed below depending on where will you stay and which Line will you take. Arc De Triomf Station Barceloneta",
          "Suitable for a stroll around, picnic, or relaxing. Close to the zoo. Also has a stunning fountain in the park. You can rent boats to paddle around on the pond as well.",

          "It'a a very nice park, lot's of flowers, trees and very quiet. Nice fountain and lake inside. Worth's see it.",
          "This was definitely one of our highlights in Barcelona. Everybody know about La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, but this park is not so known. Wonderful place with the lake and amazing fountain again designed by Gaudi.",
          "Great views, nature and more. GREAT spot for pics and to people watch. Wish I had a chance to go back at night and see the sunset over the park.",
          "I would have really liked it if the fountain was on and not sooo green. Other than that it was nice to see it. They had some stage thing set up ,probably for the festival that was going on that week",
          "When we were in Barcelona the temperature was 31 degrees. We had spent the morning on the MRT getting from our accommodation to places of interest, and after a late lunch decided to find some shade where we could relax. Parc de la Ciutadella is a green oasis in the city of",
          "A few minutes walk from Museu Picasso, this beautiful park offers lots of shady places to rest. There is also a small artificial lake (not pictured) where you can rent a little rowboat for as long as you like for only 6\u20ac.",
          "A nice change to be included in the family agenda. We loved the little rowing boat even thought wasn't too cheap. We also enjoyed the quite stroll in the park and we found the fountain to be amazing.",
          "Being in the park is relaxing and a great place to enjoy nature along its winding paths. There is an elaborate, beautiful fountain and waterfall by Fonts\u00e8re and his student Gaud\u00ed, statues like the mammoth statue, and pond with rental boats. It is near the Arc de Triomf.",
          "An excellent park with a boating lake and a Zoo. Not far just a short walk 15 min to the Pacasso museum, well worth a visit, All this would make a day trip, a good mix of things. A large park, a Zoo and the excellent Pacasso museum.",
          "Although we've visited Barcelona before we hadn't been to this park and were glad we made the visit this time. Its similar to a mini Central Park, New York. There's a zoo to one corner and then lots of paths taking you through to the old Parliament building, a boating lake,",
          "Lovely place to walk round or just sit and relax, it was nice to get away from all the crowd's of people, well worth going,",
          "Lovely park, lots of features and areas to explore. Plenty of Barcelona natives seem to visit, which must be a good sign",
          "Cool park, love it, its nice and relaxing and the golden palace is really cool and with nice water and everything.",
          "I got the feeling we could have spent most of the day here if it hadn't been so hot and we hadn't had afternoon plans. Still, it was a pleasant 2+ hours with lots to admire. The umbracle was a particular joy. We passed on the boats due to the heat. It would have been nice to",
          "We stumbled upon this beautiful park on our way to the zoo. It is quite large and very nice place for kids to play. It has a beautiful water fountains and lots of other attractions like the Parliament, Castel of three dragons and also a very lovely Zoo, I think the best Zoo we",
          "Huge park! There is a big fountain with an arc, trees grass, nature! Simply beautiful! There was also an elephant statue ! Yay!",
          "This was a nice park to wander through. Plenty of trails, open spaces to sit and relax, a lake where you can row a boat and play areas for kids. But the standout is the fountain, it is really fantastic! We sat and enjoyed looking at it for at least half an hour. There is also",
          "A nice sanctuary to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Nice landscaping in addition to fantastic architecture",
          "It is a nice parc to chill out in the city center. The main fountain is big and nice to see. Good place to sit",
          "Nice big park with a lot of people walking ,sitting,playing musik.We stayed just opposite .Big park that is closed at night.Inside there is a zoo, but we didnt visit it.",
          "Thankfully we didn\u2019t have to travel far for our visit as we were very disappointed. There is a magnificent fountain and a small boating lake, other than that it is pretty run down, with a lot of arrears fenced off.",
          "Several ways to enter this very charming park, one if which is via the Arc de Triomf. Beautiful green spaces and magnificent fountain.",
          "Very nice park at the heart of the city. There is a magnificent fountain, see the picture. Has a little pond, where you can rent boat to row yourself.",
          "This park is lovey to walk around and the fountain is lovely! The boating lake looks small but fun. The only downsides are that there really weren\u2019t very many shady places to sit, which is needed in the Barcelona sun, and a lot of vendors around, although they are not",
          "We went for a nice walk here. There is a great area to take some nice photos. Be careful with some of the aggressive vendors. They try to give your kids or yourself something or take a photo and demand money right away. Not unsafe. Enjoy your time here!",
          "a nice fresh corner in the heat ! kids had fun in the 30 mins boat ride ! the fountain looks spectacular ! it was a nice stop over before tackling the zoo at the other end of the park !",
          "Very nice park with a little pond where you can row around in the boats. Lots of people playing music and doing acrobatics between the trees. Felt like a student hangout too.",
          "Was not a good time for our visit as the fountain was under renovation. The park was huge so can take a leisurely stroll and it was even right in front of the Arc de Triomf which is a nice structure to see",
          "This park is definitely a pleasant visit if you get a chance. Although there was some maintenance happening around the time that I went there was still a lot of greenery to walk around and an area to see ducks and even ride on a boat. This park is also in the same area as the",
          "Lush park and a great escape from busy Barcelona. Sit on benches by the magnificent fountain for awhile and people watch or rent a rowboat on the little lake. Walking along the wide pathway to the Triumphal Arch brings you back into the city. A relaxing respite from the bustle.",
          "The park is clean, well maintained and a perfect place for a picnic and escape from the busy city, theres a little cafe/stand selling food and drinks which aren\u2019t too expensive",
          "A very nice place to take a picnic and just hang out. There are a lot people playing music and doing acrobatics. Ping pong tables too.",
          "This was a normal park with grass and gravel walk ways. There was one cool part which I have posted a photo off but that\u2019s it. Not worth the trip at all.",
          "It is such a picturesque park, we went onto the little lake and rented out a boat for half hour was really fun and relaxing 6-10euro depending on boat size was really reasonable, the parks centre piece statue is just incredible, looks like something from the gods, we didn\u2019t go",
          "Quite a small park, but extremely clean and well kept. For walking or running there is a signposted route, there\u2019s a playground and table tennis facilities. The only thing that put me off a little is that most of the owners let their dogs run about off-leash.",
          "Worth including as part of your tour of Barcelona. A lovely park with several features and statues that will be of interest to adults and children.",
          "Parc de la Ciutadella is a large public park east of central Barcelona. The parliament of Catalonia is located in the park as well as several landmarks of the city such as Cascada Monumental, Castle of the Three Dragons and the Desconsol sculpture. There's also a small boating",
          "Great little park in the heart of El Born neighborhood. There's also a work by Antoni Gaudi in the park (Cascada Monumental) that is worth seeing. Definitely check it out!",
          "The park in barcelona is a great alternative to the beach for a nice place to relax and soak up the rays. There are usually people there playing music which adds to the atmosphere.",
          "Very impressed by this area. Another example of how photos do not do a place its due justice. The main attaction of the park is the main fountain which is stunningly beautiful but the rest of the grounds are also nice if you want to take a small stroll or have a picnic lunch.",
          "On our first visit to Barcelona we were both amazed at how much there is to see and do...We spent a total of 6 days in this beautiful city and really did not even make a dent into what it has to offer. On the first Sunday on our two week trip we visited the Sagrada Familia and",
          "We took a walk around this park on a day trip to Barcelona so only stayed a short time but its very beautiful with lots to see so you could spend a lot more time here. There are grassy areas to sit and chill with lots of sculptures to see, there is a caf\u00e9 by the biggest",

          "We stumbled upon this park as we walked back from the marina/beach area on the way back to our hotel. What a wonderful surprise. On top of the structure shown here is a life-size gold figure of a woman in a chariot with horses! Walk a few yards further and there's an enormous",
          "Beautiful park to walk around! There are many places to lounge around and read a book or catch up with friends.",
          "Situated just in front of Arc of Triumph. The park has lots of greenery and shade. They have a lake where you can do some boating or watch the ducks. Very nice play area for kids to keep them occupied.",
          "This is a beautiful and fun park to walk through and relax in, with artists, balloons and unique items for sale. It's also close to the zoo, which we hope to see the next time we're there.",
          "Fountain will absolutely take your breath away. Quite cheaply you can rent a boat and enjoy peace on the little lake. Or just go for a relaxing stroll surrounded by all the nature friendly people. Plus you can have amazing photo with huge wooden elephant!",
          "I loved bringing my teenaged students to this park for beautiful photos with the Venus fountain! They enjoyed climbing the stone stairs for some cool selfies. Later we biked back through the park for a group photo. I also recommend walking from the park down the palm tree",
          "A walk through here is really lovely or grab a seat and enjoy people watching. There was dancing in the bandstand, the gorgeous water features, the sounds from the zoo...you could easily forget you were in a city",
          "Great place to have a walk around and enjoy the greenery. The zoo is there too. And a little cafe to stop off at",
          "Family place, where you can find Zoo, also few attractions such as The Cascada, monument of the Mamont, lake. Romantic place to spend for couples.",
          "A great urban park with many things to see both natural and cultural. Also getting off the metro at Arc de Triomf and walking through the park is a more relaxed way to enter the old city than getting off the metro at Placa de Catalunya like everybody else does.",
          "We walked round the park fairly early in the day and it was wonderfully peaceful. The fountain it amazingly beautiful.",
          "busy park - big large one, lots to do, arch of triumph is there as well..it is nice busy crowded place, lots of tourists, pickpockets as well...",
          "Loved this park beautiful architecture. The arc de triumph is directly across he street a quality camera will make the memories last a lifetime. Bubbles in the park balloons lots a family friendly-ness. Zoo to the opposite end of the park. The science museum is on sight was",
          "Perfect locationn of a park if you\u2019re tourist! It\u2019s right in the center, so it\u2019s so easy to get access to it! Been there every morning, because it\u2019s always more quiet and you can have some more time to walk alone.",
          "You will find a peaceful evening here for walking and enjoy the most beautiful artworks here. Just be reminded to avoid the drug dealers!",
          "One of the larger parks in central Barcelona, Parc de la Ciutadella has alot to offer, being near the Zoo (which requires a ticket purchase), as well as some other historic landmarks like the Castle of the Three Dragons. However, even if you arent the photo-taking type, this",
          "This park can get crowded in the morning and early afternoon. A peak time to enjoy a wonderful relaxing vibe is in the evening, after 5. It\u2019s calm and enchanting whether you\u2019re solo, with your partner or with friends/relatives. Really worth visiting to get time out from the",
          "We roamed this park one evening after the Picasso museum. It was a nice, relaxing way to spend a few hours. The main fountain area is under construction so we didn\u2019t get the full effect. The lake was very pretty. If we hadn\u2019t grown hungry, we probably would have lingered longer.",
          "this is a great park to walk around and enjoy the sites and people and monuments put on your walking boots/shoes and enjoy",
          "We walked to the Arc of Triumph and right past it we saw this park and of course we had to go explore it. We liked everything we saw. We were even more surprised to see boat rides in here. Too bad we didn't have time to go on it but it looked wonderful! :)",
          "lovely place, beautiful trees, nice atmosphere. there is a zoo too but we didn't have time to go. not too many robbers...a plague in Barcelona",
          "This place has layed between the Old Town and the Vila Ol\u00edmpica, has something for everyone. The gardens, full of statuary, offer relaxation, the boating lake is fun, and the Castell dels Tres Dragons is a Modernista masterpiece. So just go there and take photos are enough.",
          "I went to Ciutadella Park last weekend. It is a beautiful and amazing park. It was crowded because it is famous in Barcelona. I guess that every person should visit it. You should visit during the week because I think it will be emptier than in the weekend. You should enjoy with",
          "Very nice park near the beach. Lots to see with one of the most amazing monument I have ever seen. Lovely green space.",
          "This was part of our tour, the grounds are lovely and you can cycle through and really enjoy the peace.The fountain area is beautiful.",
          "I liked it. Big in size, green, has ponds hosting beautiful ducks etc... You will find all sort of people: those going for a jog, couples making out on the grass, people walking their dogs, doing sports, playing games and music. A very relaxing and versatile experience.",
          "We went mid May and is was pretty scruffy. Went to the main Cascada fountain and it looked nothing like in the DK Top 10 of Barcelona. There was a small pool of stagnant green water, not a fountain working anywhere but the chariot and horses at the top were very golden. Best",
          "The Parc de la Ciutadella offers a unique opportunity to see and meet the people of Barcelona. It is very popular. It is very close to the Arc de Triumph and the zoo. Don't miss the large fountain designed by Gaudi that he must have designed in his early years because it is much",
          "Unlike London, Barcelona does not have many green parks at its centre. It is a much more urban city, with grand tree-lined avenues and squares. One exception is the Parc de la Ciutadella, though it is slightly away from the main city centre and suffers from being cut off from",
          "The weather wasn't always sunny during our holiday, so we took the cloudier days as an opportunity to venture around the city. We were staying in one of the outer districts so decided to take the long walk into the city centre. On the way we found Parc de la Ciutadella. It is",
          "Located not far from Arc de Triomphe and a metro station you can find this beautiful place of nature. Trees with lots of birds, a small lake and of course the magnificent fountain with the golden statue decorate this parc. Unfortunately 2 times a year, one of them is now, the",

          "Absolutely stunning park. The boat ride was amazing and the monument was beautiful. We walked from Park G\u00fcell and this was with a 10 and 4 year old. Such an amazing day with lots to see. So many patisseries which are so cheap and taste amazing!",

          "We visited the park the week before Easter on a lovely sunny day. We approached from the Arc de Triomf, walking down the central avenue watching people setting off on their Segway tours. You need to cross the busy main road at the bottom of the walk way and into the Park de la",
          "The park provides a good place to take rest after wandering around Gothic Quarter and the area nearby. It's a wonderful place to feel peaceful and watch people enjoying their free time there. There's a big fountain inside the park and a pond where you can rent a boat and paddle",

          "This is a big park with paths, lawns and flowers. There are a few buildings and a waterfall within the park, you can get tours with someone who will tell you the history. I overheard (as we didn't take the tour) at some stage in history there was a king, who was so inbred he",
          "Free, unless you want to rent a boat. Visit Duration: from 1 Hour to half day. Previously a hated fortress, then converted into a prison, Parc de la Ciutadella is the greenest area in Barcelona. The park has a small lake, a giant mammoth, a fountain and wide grass areas where",
          "We started at the Arc de Trimpf and walked down through the Park. It\u2019s a beautiful place with lots of history dating back to the worlds fair in the late 1800\u2019s.

          "Honestly, one of the most beautiful parks I have ever seen. Amazing atmosphere. It is the perfect place for a picnic or just a causal walk. It is a must see when in Barcelona :) Me and my friend really enjoy this park and we have been there several times because we can\u2019t get",
          "Parc de la ciutadella is an absolutely gem to see when in Barcelona. There is so many places to explore in the park . Lots of places to also sit or sunbathe. It\u2019s just a lovely park with many activities to find and do.",
          "we drove through the park by bike on a guided tour of Barcelona. The park is beautiful and relaxing. I am sure it is difficult to spend some time on this, but unfortunately we have not taken the time to do so.",
          "Beautiful park in Barcelona. The zoo is situated here. We hired rowing boats on the lake here... \u20ac6 for two people, for half hour. So reasonable and the they're not strict on the timing either. Highly recommend a stroll through if you're in Barcelona, vibrant and full of people",
          "Walked around this park after visiting the zoo. Lots of shaded areas and a beautiful fountain which you can climb to get a nice view.",
          "We loved this park...and actually went through it several times on our treks to other designations in Barcelona. The park setting is really beautiful the structures, the light posts - all of it.",
          "This place had the potential to be a beautiful green area of Barcelona, with large meadows and the majestic fountain of Gaudi. Sadly it\u2019s poorly maintained, most of the grass is now dirt and is impossible to get some rest with the \u201ccerveza beer\u201d guys passing constantly.",
          "This was actually my husband's favorite part of Barcelona. The park isn't huge, very walkable, but has quite a bit to see. The Arc de triumph is right outside the park which is a plus. There are artisans selling items, musicians hanging out, and people just basking in the",
          "My family visited there on June 16. It's amazing place too. Actually we need more time to visit there. Our visiting time was very short but we're happy to see it's architecture and cultural heritage. It's one of the must see place in Barcelona as well.",

          "Like most people, the first area I wanted to check out was the fountain. I walked the steps and took in all the surrounding greenery and architecture. There were a lot of people taking pictures and just enjoying the views throughout the park. There are areas you can sit and",
          "Was the only green park in Barcelona until the 1900's. Beautiful fountains. There was a festival going on and it was fun to hear AC/DC being played in spanish! There was tons of free games and the Sangria from the stands was the best I've had yet in Spain. Which is a lot. It was",
          "Took a stroll through this lovely park near the Arc de Triumph with the Missus on a wee trip to Barcelona. Plenty of sights to take in like the Hivernacle, Winter Gardens, and the Three Dragons....also the Zoological and Geological museums are here. But as busy as it can get it",
          "Loved everything about this park, amazing! It\u2019s really big, the fountain and the sculptures were great and it\u2019s really close to the zoo. Would recommend",
          "A very nice park to have a stroll. Enjoy the beautiful statues and the water. Peace and quiet all around!",
          "I sat and read in a few spots over a couple of hours, whilst on a general mooch about the city, and the parc de la ciutadella is as good a place as any to spend a few hours Like all of Barcelona's parks, this is well maintained and cared for; and on top of that there is some",
          "i was in new york and is similar to entral park but in small size, also you have a lake with boats and ducks, very familiar place",
          "I came here on the recommendation of tripadvisor and I wasn't disappointed. It isn't very big but it is very beautiful and has a small lake where you can hire boats and row them. The crowning piece of this is park though is a large nympheum, a large fountain you can walk up with",
          "My husband and I took a nice walk here on a nice sunny afternoon. You can rent bikes nearby, but it was close to where we were staying and we just walked over. The park is very interesting for sure, with many different art pieces throughout. There is a statue of an elephant,",
          "This park is great for one reason. It is in center of the city, so it is great for little rest during walking across the city. In negative it is very crowded. Park is great for little kids, but adults also have smgt ti do",
          "such a gem, so glad we found this, very good for pics on the mammoth!. lovely lake and greenhouse for plants",
          "This Park is adjacent to the Zoo, and borders the Catalonian Parliament, which means it has limited access points. But it is a very pleasant enclave, and the waterfall area a relaxing spot. Worth a visit....",
          "the showpice fountain in this park is amazing. It's a big park with lots going on from flamenco schools in the bandstand to sculpture trails. There is a nice cheap cafe in front of the main fountain.",
          "Lots of locals come here with family and friends. We were here on a Sunday and even though there was an event being held there, I could tell it was a beloved place for people to go relax and hide from the summer heat under some tree shade. Many people were there laying out from",

          "On a beautiful afternoon we strolled through this large park enjoying seeing all the families, particularly the children, partaking in numerous juvenile activities. The enormous classical fountain with its shining golden crest is impressive.",
          "This is a lovely park, in my opinion better than Montjuic, but it is also more than a park with the zoo, fountain, statues and the building that houses the Catalan Parliament. Is it the presence of the Catalan Parliament that ensures that its maintained to a high standard? Large",
          "This was a lovely parc. Some people were on a lake with a boat. It was very peaceful at the time we went which was early evening.",
          "We liked the fountain very much and it was a relaxing place to go after our intense couple of days of touring the city sights. There are several buildings that were built for an expo in 1888 that are in sad states of repair but it is still a lively park with nice features.",
          "We went here on a Sunday afternoon for a walk which is clearly popular with the locals. Lovely park with a nice fountain and wild parrots that you can get close to for photos.",
          "Parc de la Ciutadella is located on the outskirts of Barcelona so it is away from most of the hustle and bustle but still accessible by metro. We entered the park via the side entrance which seemed to be mainly in use by local dog walkers and sport enthusiasts. There are",
          "Lovely place,with many bikes to hire. There is a zoo here but we didn\u2019t visit so can\u2019t say anything about that. The stand out feature is the beautiful fountain. Well worth seeing and relaxing.",
          "Home to the three dragons castle, plenty of fountains and paths galore. Tons of families, big groups of kids, stoners, guitars... older couples all mixed and wandering, stumbling or sitting around. Sunshine and humanity... just lovely.",
          "We were there on a sunny day, with a segway tour and we got to see the fountains, the facilities built for the world's fair, the old city walls. The gardens were outstanding and it was incredibly peaceful.",
          "We happened to visit the park as one of our stops during a bicycle tour. Spacious grounds, the monument and fountain is beautiful. Would loved to have spent more time.",
          "Nice big park with amazing lake, loads of green spaces and great atmosphere. Make sure you see the fountain and take a pedal-boat",
          "just kidding. :D amazing park. although you can find many pushers and thieves at night here and no police (dangerous place when sun goes down). whatever, you can take suntan and have picnic there with friends and have fun activities. zoo just on a side. little lake where you can",
          "We stumbled onto this amazing park. The sculptures are gorgeous, it represents all the beauty of old world. If you are anywhere near here, especially if you like to take photographs, I'd stop by.",
          "Go to this park if you wqnt some peace and quiet in the middle of town. From the Arch of Victory to the Zoo, it is a lovely place",
          "This place is a little far out of the city centre but definitely worthwhile visiting. We were staying a few blocks away and made our way over from the Marina area. A little bit of a walk but nice all the same. Upon entering the park it is clear to see the area is very well",
          "This is a lovely park, very peaceful and a welcome escape from the crowds and general noise of the city. Lots of shaded areas, grassy areas, the really amazing monumental fountain and a pretty little pond with ducks where you can hire rowing boats for short periods. There are",
          "Worth the while for a quiet outdoors stroll. Variety of the plantations (an enormous, gorgeous Jasmin tree stroke me), many birds, an impressive fountain. On the week-end many locals come catch a breeze there. Relaxed atmosphere, for this stroll from the arch to the sea side.",
          "Best to do it with a rented bicycle this way you can ride your way around and not get too tired - it's a very big place close to the zoo too (if you have kids with you)",
          "We had a pleasant stroll through Parc de la Ciutadella in the evening. We saw the lovely the Arc de Triomf nearby.",
          "Lovely park, just a few minutes walk from Franca station. Take in the large fountain, eat an ice cream, check out the stone mammoth sculpture. Would be a good place for a picnic.",
          "This was a beautiful site. Worth a visit. I would recommend walking so that you don't miss anything.",
          "The park is beautiful, full of life, tourists, locals, green. Please do yourself a favor and walk (and/or picnic) there! And then you can visit The Arc de Triomf.",
          "On a Tuesday late afternoon, the park was just crowded enough for people-watching, but not so crowded to relax after a long day of walking and site-seeing. There were several street entertainers creating giant bubbles...very beautiful. The fountain alone is worth the visit!",
          "This is a good park for a nice walk and there are some interesting statues and monuments. Also a boating lake and it is very close to the Arc de Triumph.",
          "We had to find the entrance but it was worthy. The fountains are really nice and the water point really well taking care of. It is a nice place to sit on the branch after comida and have short siesta Spanish style",
          "It is very nice for a walk around(not in winter). It is relaxing and very put together. give it a try! I liked it!",
          "Great place to relax, enjoying nature. The park is great for outdoor activities and in addition there is a zoo, good for children.",
          "nice and quiet park, usually not as crowded, nice for a walk in the afternoon, early evening when it s not as hot anymore, lots of benches to sit down and relax, the fountain is absolutely gorgeous and seems from a fantasy movie - very nice",
          "It is a large park near the city center. Unfortunately there is no entrances on one side of the park so if you come to it from that side you will be forced to go around the park and find some. But the park is worth to visit.",
          "Nice park, with some greenery and an impressive fountain. That is about it. Good for a break in Barcelona, especially on a sunny day.",
          "This is a big park from an expo long, long ago. The fountains, sculptures, and big expo buildings are quite grand. Also good landscaping. Big park.",
          "A friend recommended we visit here, and it wasn't originally on my to do list, but I am glad I took their advice! A beautiful park, with some great buildings and sculptures. It is mostly about chilling, relaxing, eating, drinking and people watching - fabulous.",

          "We happen to see this place purely by chance as we were walking past and soon discovered a gold colored statue shining in the evening sun. We were thrilled when we got to see this place up close. As we explored further, we came across gardens and finally the Catalan Parliament",
          "Lots of fun stuff to see at the park, fountain, and various government buildings. Arc a plus. My 2-year-old had a great time, as did I. Good for an hour or two.",
          "A lovely green space in the city. There is a boating lake and a lovely fountain (Cascada). There are also great buildings here, including Castell dels Tres Dragons, the Catalonian Parliament, and Barcelona Zoo. You can get refreshments from cabins in the park.",
          "Had a visit during our trip to Barcelona. Not much there, nice grassy areas ect but the building that housed the botanics is boarded up and lots of areas have fencing up to stop people walking across grass ect. Tiny play park for kids, suited to ages 2-5. Nothing for kids",
          "The park is lush and contains both some spots for sightseeing - beautiful fountain, mammoth statue and a pond - and just lounging oj a sunny day on a bench or grass. We especiqlly enjoyed bringing some food and drinks with us for a sunlit lunch while feeding pigeons and",
          "This is a large green space with a beautiful fountain - unfortunately out of water when we were there as it was early season i guess. There are lots of places to sit and rest and some pretty plants - a pleasant respite from the crowds!",

          "Beautiful February day. Been to Barcelona a few times but never to park. Had lovely stroll. Place full of people of different ages doing different things- even saw folk training to be street entertainers. Particularly liked the fountain",
          "This park has so much to see, it's worth spending a few hours. From a monument to the 1800s expo (see pic) and several other monuments and sculptures, to the star of the show - Cascada Monument (see pics) containing statues and fountains 2 storeys tall, with a gorgeous",
          "My hostel was right next to here so I walked through a lot. There are always people hanging out, playing music, and relaxing so it is a great place to just people watch and absorb your surroundings. If I had more time I would have definitely had a picnic-type activity here and",
          "If you just want to get away from the hustle and bustle of mid city, this place is a true haven, beautiful gardens with massive walkways, very elegant and stately near the arc de triumph and right next to the zoo... a great family meeting place ...we loved to just sit and people",
          "I walked through the park on a Saturday morning and got a glimpse into local life - people playing table tennis, dog walkers, yoga classes, circus performers, couples on a boating lake. There\u2019s the added bonus of a beautiful fountain which unfortunately was undergoing repairs",
          "Every city all over the world has their park to call their own. Barcelona has this one and it does not disappoint. Lovely place to walk and see the people, fountains, etc. Very worthwhile.",

          "It's the perfect place for a morning (or afternoon) stroll after a few packed days in Barcelona. We walked to the park from the Arco de Triunfo - great opportunity for little ones to run about and adults to stretch their legs",
          "I expect this is a beautiful park in the summer. It was rather wet the day we visited but the fountain is worth a look. Being cleaned at the moment but still pretty. We had an excellent brunch at a place nearby called Picnic. the Arc d'Triomphe is nearby and has a pretty",
          "When we were in Barcelona last week I was on a mission to not miss this place, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The gold statue of the horses was a lovely sight and also managed to find the woolly mammoth hidden in the trees too,which the daughter thought was amazing. We were also",
          "It is big and full of surprises. I love the variety of people in here. All the statues around, kids areas, dancing for pansexual purpose as Spain is very accepting country, nice touch. Lake in the middle where you can rent a boat and go around with your love one or family, just",
          "Beautiful parc for relaxation! We even played pingpong, which is pretty popular. 5 tables were used all day long! It is a nice parc for a good walk. In the pool you can even hire a boat for fun! Nice to spend your day, you can have a nice walk!",

          "This time, we visited the park during the winter. The park, while shedding most of its glamour and beauty, still looked lovely, if only a bit deserted and neglected. It's worth a visit, though, no matter which season you visit Barcelona.",
          "Rented a bike and happened upon this park by accident. Lots of sculptures and monuments, I can see it being beautiful on a summer day. Not something that\u2019s a must visit or anything .",

          "We spent a little time wondering around the park. The fountain was very nice and the park made for a leisurely stroll, but is probably best seen in other seasons. It was fun to see the colorful cloths laid out for sale along the walkway.",
          "After going to several tourist attractions in the city, we went to this park in the afternoon. It was a great place for a leisurely stroll and to just rest and unwind from our busy morning.",
          "WE visited in January and the place was still very busy with families enjoying picnics and the amenities. We did get caught by some people begging and there are a lot of homless people lying around. However the park has some amazing buildings and architecture. Such a shame some",
          "This park is frozen in time. It has the museum of geology and a greenhouse that are closed and in decay--but gorgeous architecture. When you walk along the paths, you see many immigrants selling wares but it feels safe. In the back corner is the most amazing fountain. It is home",

          "Out and about just strolling around when we found this nice park so decided to walk through it for some piece and quiet. Lovely statues at the entry but just inside to the right there seemed to be a couple off old derelict buildings that spoilt the look a bit. A few family\u2019s",

          "The park is free. The central part of the park is the building that is shown eveywhere. The gold chariot gleems. The building was under repair or in need of repair, but still worth seeing. There are nice gardens, shade trees and a pond in the park with pedal boats. I found",

        "wiki": "The Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art (Catalan: Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, IPA: [mu\u02c8z\u025bw \u02c8\u00f0a\u027et kunt\u0259mpu\u02c8\u027eani \u00f0\u0259 \u03b2\u0259\u027es\u0259\u02c8lon\u0259], MACBA) is a contemporary art museum situated in the Pla\u00e7a dels \u00c0ngels, in El Raval, Ciutat Vella, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The museum opened to the public on November 28, 1995. Previous directors were Daniel Giralt-Miracle (1988\u20131994), Miquel Molins Nubiola (1995\u20131998), Manuel J. Borja-Villel (1998\u20132007), and Bartomeu Mar\u00ed (2008-2015), while the current director, since 2015 is Ferran Barenblit.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1959, art critic Alexandre Cirici Pellicer formed a group of contemporary artists showing work in a series of 23 exhibitions with the hopes of beginning a collection for a new contemporary art museum in Barcelona. It was not until 1986 that the Barcelona City Council recommended the American architect Richard Meier & Partners (1987\u20131995) to design the museum. Art critics Francesc Miralles and Rosa Queralt were hired to write the museum\u2019s mission statement. In 1987, the MACBA Foundation was created. In the following year the MACBA Foundation, in conjunction with the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Barcelona City Council, founded the MACBA Consortium in order further the process of the museum. The Consortium commissioned Meier later that year to build the museum. This was a controversial issue considering that the museum had no collection at the time of construction. The museum opened to the public in 1995, well after the 1992 Summer Olympics for which it was planned.In 2014, the museum acquired an additional venue for its programming, comprising a converted 15th-century chapel and two large halls, a total of about 21,500 square feet, as well as the central Pla\u00e7a dels Angels square. While MACBA has long used the chapel for performances and site-specific installations, this time the city lent the entire historic cluster to the institution for an unspecified term.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nMeier embraced the difficult task of creating a building that would ultimately display a variety of contemporary artworks that were unknown to him at the time of design. The choice to build the museum in the Pla\u00e7a dels \u00c1ngels is consistent with Meier\u2019s vision to situate the building amongst some of Barcelona\u2019s oldest streets and buildings, in addition to revamping the public space of the Raval.After the completion of the $35 million construction, local media referred to the museum as \u201cthe pearl\u201d amongst the old architecture and narrow streets just a few blocks from Gothic center of Barcelona. The building\u2019s architectural style has strong references to Modernism. The large (120 by 35 meters) white building has much of its southern elevation glazed, providing the visitor with views across the plaza, and allowing for an abundance of natural light to illuminate the interior galleries. The museum has three main galleries, which can be subdivided, as well as five smaller galleries, one of which is in a tower.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe permanent collection of around 5,000 works (up from 1,100 works at the time of the museum's opening in 1995) dates from the mid-20th century onward. There are three periods of modern art represented: the first one covers the forties to the sixties; the second spans the sixties and seventies; the third period is contemporary. The collections focus on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art, although some International artists are also represented.In 2007, the Center for Studies and Documentation MACBA was created, which developed a facet of complementary collecting with the traditional collection.\nIn 2011, Philippe M\u00e9aille loans 800 works of the radical conceptualists artists group Art & Language at MACBA. Fearing political instability after the Catalonia referendum in October 2017, he will withdraw his loan and repatriate his collection to Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art.\n\n\n== Education, publications, events ==\nIn December 2007, the museum opened its Study Center, and the Library Reading Room and Special Collections Room grant the public free access to the museum\u2019s books, publications collection, and archives.\nThe museum publishes mainly exhibition catalogues from the museum, although has published some monographic books and critical essays. It also has three digital publications: \"Quaderns port\u00e0tils,\" \"Quaderns d'\u00c0udio,\" and \"S\u00e8rie Capella MACBA.\"\nThe museum offers lectures, seminars, guided tours, video screenings and more to broaden the educational opportunities available to the public.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Museum address is Pla\u00e7a dels Angels, 1, Barcelona. The closest metro stations are Catalunya and Universitat.\nOpposite the main museum, in the medieval Convent dels \u00c0ngels for which the square is named, a chapel has been converted into a separate exposition area known as the Capella del MACBA, with regular video art performances. Entrance to this part of the museum is free.\nAnother contemporary art museum, Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona (CCCB), is adjacent to MACBA, and accessible from both the street and the inner patio.\nThe area in front of the museum is known among skateboarders to be one of the most iconic \"spots\" for the sport in the world. A 3D model of the location is featured in the smartphone game \"Skater\", and was a featured location in Transworld Skateboarding magazine for Go Skateboarding Day in 2016.\n\n\n== Management ==\nMACBA is managed by a consortium founded in 1988 whose members include the regional government of Catalonia, Barcelona City Council, and the Spanish Ministry of Culture. In March 2015, Bartomeu Mar\u00ed i Ribas resigned as director of the museum in light of a censorship row over a controversial installation by the Austrian artist Ines Doujak. In July 2015, Ferran Barenblit, was named the new director.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Barcelona\nMuseo de Escultura al Aire Libre de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares\nRinzen, by Antoni T\u00e0pies, conserved at the Museum\nR\u00e0dio Web MACBA\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMeier, Richard.

          "For those who love (partly) modern and (mostly) postmodern art there are certainly some interesting segments and artworks (notably J.M. Basquiat's paintings, famous conceptualist pieces, exceptional work by Jo Spence etc), however in general doesn't offer anything so unique,",

          "Very small and uninteresting, half of the museum was closed. Hardly any artwork, but lots of old newspapers. Staff was unfriendly and not interested in offering any info. The best part are the skateboarders outside, at least some contemporary art can be seen through the windows.",
          "One of the worst museums I have visited. Main floor was closed and other two were pretty much uninteresting and pretencious. Only good thing is design of building and skaters outside. Save yourself 11\u20ac and buy a drink and chat with skaters.",

          "This place was expensive (\u20ac11 each), and the art on show really wasn't good. My wife is an artist and art teacher who loves galleries and she was deeply unimpressed. I found two pieces in the whole gallery that I liked. The main exhibition in the top floor was a lot about sound",

          "Visited MACBA on my first day in BCN. There are a number of nice cafes nearby for a drink and bite to eat if needed. The building is lovely inside and out - we were there on a spectacularly sunny day, so the main hall was flooded with light. The exhibits were very interesting",

          "A medium-sized collection of contemporary art, well worth a visit. The building is attractive and the permanent is collection is well-laid out in a series of rooms on the second floor. I am not sure I accept the conceit behind the special exhibition in the first floor (artists'",

          "Great building, lots of modern art, less crowds then most other Barcelona museums. And it's only 10 euros. What's the issue? I guess it's a museum for Catalans and Spanish and many of those are on vacation out of Barcelona in August. Not many tourists because I'd say that",

          "The building looks beautiful from the outside and inside. However the actual exhibitions were not as exciting as I had hoped. Cost us 10 euro each which isn't bad. Most of the text alongside art was in Catalan, not even Spanish which my mother speaks.",

          "We have been to MONA in Tasmania, Australia and found it much more interesting than what is on offer here at the moment. It wreaks of self centred importance (my view) and whilst some concepts were of interest, the actual displays were weak overall. Great venue with too much",
          "Really nice extensive exhibits laid out over 3 floors showing a range of artists- you could spend hours here. Free entry which is also a nice plus.",
          "We went there as my daughter is a fan of art. We were all a little bit disappointed as, even though the building is well done and representative, the art itself was underwhelming. Moreover, its location left us a little bit uneasy. Lots of skaters around, and there was some",
          "Ground floor had audio explanations from app in English which helped close the gap between the works and possible interpretations. Next two floors were less accessible.",
          "I came here with my boyfriend, I like contemporary art and so was really looking forward to it but I was disappointed, for the 10 euros I paid to get in I don\u2019t think I got much out of it, the info on the pieces wasn\u2019t great and there was one exhibition that had no English",
          "Totally underwhelming. A huge white space void of any warmth or credibililty . They haven't even got off their rear ends and scrubbed off the graffiti off a magnificant black obelisk sculpture in the entryway which now seems to be a skateboard park. In fact two American tourists",
          "I\u2019m not a big fan of contemporary art so I can\u2019t judge for the art part but it was a very nice museum and very clean.",
          "Contemporary art is not among our favorite, but we are open to learning and wanted to visit since we were nearby. For contemporary art lovers, MACBA may be worth a visit although we were somewhat disappointed on the afternoon we were there. It seemed that half of the museum",
          "We went skating at the mecca of european skateboarding! its an amazing feeling, a lot of friendly people and pros and a lot of people selling cheap cold beers...what else can you ask????",
          "We happened to visit on a Saturday evening during what was a museum night celebration being held throughout the city so there was no entrance charge. That turned out to be a good thing since there was little of traditional modern art in the museum. We enjoyed the structure as a",
          "Not much was open on Mondays, but MACBA was. It's located in the middle of the university, and many skateboarders are in the courtyard. Wide open spaces with explanations of the art did not charm us. In fact, how do we know these very large pieces are actually art? This",
          "Hardly any artwork, half the museum is closed. Buy a couple of drinks instead and watch the skate boarder's outside, much more entertaining.",
          "My partner is an artist, we have visited museums all over Europe, this was an absolute Joke, empty room art work was a disgrace, half of the building was closed, definitely do not bother",
          "The MACBA building is spectacular from the outside, and gorgeous inside. Just beware the skate borders as you approach! There does not appear to be any permanent collection, rather a number of one off exhibitions. A great place to lose yourself and contemplate the art.",
          "While waiting for our tour to start at the Picasso Museum we wondered by this museum. It\u2019s not even a minute or two walk from the Picasso Museum. We toured the whole thing on our own within half an hour. It\u2019s not very crowded and a lot of the artwork is lifelike.",
          "This is a must when visiting BCN, because so close to the city center, because of the architecture, because it is full of choices for later lunch or soft drink, ...and because of modern art, for sure.",
          "This is a very spacious, airy gallery. There is a large array of art spread across three floors (that I saw. Not sure if there was a basement) and it is displayed in a way that gives the viewer good perspective, space and distance. That being said, I didn't see much in the way",
          "I got free admission with my Barcelona Card. Photography is allowed in the museum. This museum featured contemporary artwork. I have to admit that the artwork in this museum did not appeal to me. There are lockers for storage and a gift shop. Watch where you are walking in",
          "if contemporary Art is your thing this is a pretty good experience there is a lot to see a lot to get from all of the displays or paintings.",
          "My friend and I (keen artists) visited MACBA after reading great things about it this March. The architecture of the building is minimal and beautiful - but thats probably the best thing about it. The exhibitions don't hold much explanation and there is no clear guide how to",
          "We visited the museum in a group and had a very good tour by a guide who made us understand and to some extend even start to appreciate some of the pieces of art that would otherwise not be ... OK, \"de colorises et ...\".",
          "Everytime I am in Barcelona, I visit MACBA, and every time I discover someting new! The arcitrcture is also fantastic.",
          "Richard Meier consistently designs masterpieces, and this is an elegant, bright building. My son, who is an avid skateboarder, knew of this place for the plaza in front that is inhabited by skater dudes. The museum is worth a visit, though, but get the ARTICKET BCN and visit",
          "Its surroundings, right in the very core of Barcelona city, make it a not-to miss spot while strolling the pedestrians streets of the Raval quarter. Watch out for pickpockets & other sorts of people,though.",
          "Even being art student I\u2019m surprised that such a nice building has collection like this. Maybe we were at wrong time of the year for wrong exhibition but that was extremely boring and just nothing to see there. Have you seen any museum of contemporary art out there? Even in my",
          "MACBA is in the centre of Barcelona in the Gothic district. The building is nice and modern with high celings. They have interesting exhibitions including videos, sculptures, paintings and even some light sculptures. There is a good variety of different styles and types of art.",
          "Visited for class with about 30 people in the morning. I absolutely loved the building, it was gorgeous in the sunlight. I love the very open concepts and the galleries are very nice. Only visited a few of the exhibitions but I really enjoyed it. A nice way to spend an hour or",
          "To be honest, I liked MACBA more from outside, it's a very nice building and around it is very great atmosphere, as the skateboards riding there everywhere. The museum inside is nice too, some exibition vere a little bit boring, but some of them were one of the best things I",
          "When I'm in Barcelona I always visit the MACBA. With contemporary art you never know what to expect. This time, I visited early January 2018, it was disappointing. There was an exhibition with work from Rosemarie Castoro which had some interesting details Another large",
          "Really really boring and not worth 10\u20ac. Nothing thought provoking, nothing that would spark any interest. We just went thru it really quickly 'cause nothing really got our attention. The building itself is nice but we shoul've just stayed outside and watch the skaters. That",
          "The MACBA building was quite good but the exhibition when we visited in January was quite boring. We went through each room quite quickly and did not have to wait and ponder about most exhibits. I am not an arty type so maybe its just me. I will not visit again unless its free.",
          "The architecture is light and airy from the entrance however the exhibition space over the three floors is repetitive and consequently the navigation for each floor is pschologically boring. The three concurrent exhibitions could also have been more contrasting. Nothing bad, but",
          "All modern art can be scary, it can shock, offend, or simply bore. MACBA probably change their exhibitions frequently and in which case you might find something interesting. For me the art on show in December 2017 was a bitter disappointment. Pretentious, unskilled, lacking",
          "Hit and especially miss. Most is a waste of your time. Some is nice to see. The scale balances to the negative unfortunately.",
          "Included as part of the ARTICKETBCN, MACBA features a thoroughly underwhelming collection further marred by the fact that during our visit the workers were on strike for unfair labor practices. Although slightly more impressive than the CCCB which was also \u2018supposedly\u2019 included",
          "Friendly striking staff on a picket line explained that entrance was free because of their industrial action, so we paid into the strike fund instead (completely voluntarily, no pressure). We were gripped by the excellent exhibition on forensic architecture.",
          "The place is nice, the museum is bright and big, there was free entrance - which I'm glad there was, wouldn't have wanted to pay for this. There was very little variety, and felt like very little art. The first floor was a mix of different artists - nothing very exciting, the",
          "We decided to brave the catalan rally on Sunday and arrived at this place. We knew there was a strike so we were met at the front door by strikers who explained the strike to us. Entrance was free because of the strike and the exhibits on level 2 on \"Forensic Architecture \" kept",
          "This is not a museum of art. It is a collection of propaganda displays and materials. Very disappointed in it. Do not recommend.",
          "Highly recommended, it was free entrance as well not sure if it's because of the city festival at the time. The shop is worth a visit too.",
          "Although I like conceptual art the exhibition we saw really didn't work for me. However the building itself is an excellent example of modern architecture and is a pleasure to walk around.",
          "Check out their temporary expos here and you might find something you want to see. I did and it was a good visit. The building is not one of Barcelona's best, but it's in the middle of an old historic neighborhood. A magnet for art students.",
          "The museum staff were having a strike when we visited so we didn't hae to pay a entrance fee. After visiting the whole museum we were pleased that we didn't pay an entrance fee. We were expecting some modern with some engineering, not what saw. It was all very random, some",
          "Decided to visit this after Museu Picasso and was extremely disappointed, do not waste your time or money. No art here only social expression. Have been to Modern art museums in San Francisco, New York, San Jose and other places...while I don't always appreciate the style, there",
          "Thanks for pointing this out on your website. Closed due to industrial action, but yippee the shop was open.",
          "Went there to see some pictures and a look at old photos from Egypt and some first hand stories of the troubles in that area.",
          "After enjoying our visits to MNAC and Museu Picasso we were looking forward to the MACBA as our final museum stop of our trip. However it was very disappointing! As mentioned in previous reviews the actual exhibitions and displays are pretentious and hardly art. I did not engage",
          "Ok, there's some clever and elaborate work here, but even when we took time to contemplate and understand some of the work we found it unrewarding. There were a few pieces from the permanent collection that were absorbing. We took in all the galleries on the date of our visit.",
          "Visited today the MACBA in Barcelona. I was expecting more. I am clearly not a connoisseur, but I wasn't expecting exhibits that concentrated on the oppression of some people in different parts of the world. I enjoyed the exhibit on photography in the Arab world, but my visit",
          "MacBa is a striking building. Fantastic architecture and a radical concept. If you walk along Career Elisabets from Las Ramblas you will be stunned by this very modern building in the midst of a very old part of town. When it was built this was off course quite controversial.",
          "If the above are not on your list, then this may or may not be the place for you. A modern art museum with a human rights (Think Canadian Human Rights Museum) slant that holds its place with the galleries of the world's major cities. It isn't huge, but the white clean lines and",
          "The contemporary art is a challenging experience for those who are not initiated in the basic concepts, therefore, MACBA is a adequate museum to learn more about art. If you have only a few hours as I had and will not be able to visit the whole museum, start at the main MACBA",
          "Wonderful spaces displaying fabulous art. Could wander for hours and get lost in the sheer wonder of the place. The cafe is also splendid. Wonderful location near the park.",
          "I'm not reality into contemporary, so maybe I'm not the best judge. I didn't find a single exhibit remotely interesting and the museum did nothing to dispel the notion that I find contemporary to be little more than pretentious rubbish purchased by people with too much money. In",
          "I think this place is going to be somewhat hit or miss for visitors. For me it was a hit, yet I can't necessarily explain why. The areas outside of the exhibit areas are bright and provide perfect reset opportunities. While the art ran the gamut from what the heck, a few eye",
          "You maybe won't like all the temporary exhibitions but the permanent one offers some very good pieces of art. And the building itself is amazing.",
          "Another museum which seems not to attract the crowds (but should!). Lots of interesting exhibits (and some weird ones too) and I particularly enjoyed the photography section. Shame the top floor isn't finished yet but an enjoyable museum experience.",
          "We have visited modern art galleries in most cities we have visited, and the building here is fresh, bright and promising. However, that is about it... We arrived when it opened at 11 and the staff were very helpful. We decided to start at the top, which is the second floor at",
          "I was not sure I wanted to go to one more museum. A couple is generally enough for me but I am certainly glad that I made the decision to go to MACBA. The exhibits were amazing and informative. I will not forget the photographs from \"100 Years\" by Hans-Peter Feldmann any time",
          "Although we didn't go into the museum, we found the mural by Keith Haring just outside and spent a long time looking at each aspect of it. Although it's hidden behind the backstreets of Barcelona you definitely have to make your way through it to visit the recreation of his",
          "One of the very best modern art exhibitions we've seen in a very long time - and that's after visiting just one floor of this huge and striking building, and loving what was nonetheless a thought-provoking and even troubling exhibition which questioned our ways of seeing and",
          "Fun and not too expensive museum with contemporary art exhibitions, each new one was better than the previous and a really great way to spend a few hours. The area around is also great for walking around.",
          "The best part of the gallery was the building itself. A beautiful big white space stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city. The pieces are sparse and the space of the galleries is not used well in my opinion, so pieces are crammed into little rooms off the main",
          "If you speak Spanish or Catalans no problem otherwise much of what is on show will be wasted on you I fear - it was on us.",
          "Wonderful architecture,but as all contemporary art museums it all depends on the current exhibit. Gelatina dura was intensely thought provoking, Madeinusa a bit boring.",
          "The building itself was the best part of the visit as the architecture is quite interesting. The exibits itself were very mixed - there were 2 or 3 interesting pieces, but the rest was rather odd and not very interesting.",
          "while I really like the architecture of the building,I was kind of disappointed with the actual exhibitions. Nice,well done, but somehow not really the wow thing. But as we were lucky and had a day of free entrance, I did not regret coming here :-)",
          "Easily my favourite place to go and chill. Outside, you'll see tons of skaters showing off their tricks. Inside, the building is minimalist, with extremely thought-provoking art. It is an amazing place to take photos. Behind the museum you have Keith Haring's famous mural for",
          "Zipped in with our Articket. The collection, and the temporary exhibits, show how art reflects society, often questioning accepted points of view (which is why most dictators censor art). We enjoyed experiencing the wind tunnel in the main collection. Hard Gelatin is a hard",
          "Very informative museum. Expositions are locaed in chronological order and it is easy to follow the idea and see it developing. Spanish definitely know their contemporary art :) emuseum is suitable for those who don't know what modern art is at all, as well as for those who are",
          "We were expecting to see a few famous pieces of artwork but instead saw some really whacky exhibitions , our children just laughed at most of the stuff , the toilets were nice but \u20ac32 for the four of us was a bit steep .",
          "Very eclectic selection of interesting artists with very nice presentation and flow from exhibit to exhibit. Leave yourself several hours or make two trips. On a sunny day you can go outside and watch the skateboarders for a break.",
          "I really enjoyed the museum. The political and social references in the art tell you a lot about regional and national politics from the 1930s onward to today. Your ticket is good for one month so you can come back. It's very powerful to take in one viewing.",
          "A wonderful experience for those who like modern art. The mos exciting exhibit was the showing of 100 years of photos: i.e. 101 people were photographed at ages from 10 months, 1 year, 2 years,... til 100 years old. different people, different ages. a whole life cycle- GREAT",
          "Being very critical of contemporary art, I surprisingly spent a great time here. The rationales of all exhibits were well expressed.",
          "Lively in the city centre the museum makes an impression if you approach it walking from Las Ramblas",
          "The building and space is like an exhibit in itself. Richard Meier buildings are usually extraordinary and this is no exception. I can't recommend enough (even if 10e is quite expensive).The current Miralda exhibit being of particular interest.",
          "I saw a very good exhibition from the museum collection of art-works from around the world. There were very interesting performance documentations. The building is nice from inside as well as outside.",
          "Worth a visit only for building. Great arcitecture. The expositions were interesting. Recommendeble and nice area.",
          "Loved the exhibitions they had! And the way they where curated in the space, which invites you to go through.",
          "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA The best exhibit was a grey, black and white installation on the ground floor. Unfortunately this was just a seating area. Comfy chair though.",
          "Interesting exhibits. We especially like one which showed 100 pictures of different people; one black & white photo for every year of life up to 100 years.",
          "I like contemporary art and it is not on the top 10 things to do in Barcelona. We had articket so for sure worth the visit. I will suggest this place only for people who like to visit contemporary art at any city they go. The area is beautiful - Born and check which exhibition",
          "This museum has over 5000 works and of course only a limited number is exhibited at a given time. This special exhibition (until summer 2017) primarily has videos etc. Don't expect many paintings. The part of the exhibition focusing on conflict, borders and migration had several",
          "... but the exhibition is ot worth paying.. if you call this art I am maybe to stupid to understand it. The building is exceptional and very very nice but the exhibition made me going furious...",
          "The emphasis was more on installations and video art. It lacked paintings. The display areas and visitors galleries were modern. The museum shop had very innovative products. The cafe's and open spaces outdoors encourage young people to visit, absorb and enjoy the ambiance. I",
          "It was only showing a single collection but was interesting and informative! Also very cheap! Building is magnificent and the quality on the collection was excellent",
          "Arrived here at 2pm and only had 1hour to visit since the place is closed at 3pm on sundays. Ticket is \u20ac10 per pax but we were told we can return on another day with the same ticket. The museum has 3 stories and each floor showcased different work of art. During our visit, they",
          "I expected a lot of contemporary art but did not see anything I liked. there were some video exhibits that were not to my liking. in and out in 10 min",
          "This shows a mix of their own collections and changing exhibits. Both are a mix of installations and video art, etc. There is a lot of void space in the museum that gives the impression that there is more there than there is, whereas the actual amount of space given to",
          "The first thing you'll notice is the many skateboarders doing their thing out in front. It's impressive to watch, and feels like performance art - unexpected and welcome in a public space. The building itself is beautiful and makes great use of light. There is a large common",
          "I love contemporary art. Severly dislike this museum. Don't bother or waste your precious holiday time",
          "Cheap entrance if you want to go back several times a month or to use their Wifi repeatedly but the art was not my style. Lots of video pieces and very in-your-face Punk exhibit. Information available in many languages. Nice to watch the skateboarders outside.",
          "Not on the top 10 list, but worth the visit. Great building, nice to watch the skaters outside. Inside : PUNK show is very intense, the living art also great.",
          "Entry to the gallery was reasonably priced, \u20ac10 for adults and \u20ac8 student concessions, and unlike some places that does get you into both temporary exhibits as well as the permanent collection. This is probably only a good visit for people who are already fans of contemporary",
          "Housed in an attractive all-white modern building, we were unimpressed by the collections. The major temporary exhibit, Punk, was an incoherent jumble of stuff. It would have been a lot better if there were any punk music to accompany the exhibits and make them fun, but no.",
          "We were not initially planning on visiting this museum, but we stumbled upon it and we were happy we did. The punk exhibit was very thought-provoking, and so was Andrea Fraser's \"L\u20191%, c'est moi.\" I read some bad reviews of the museum here and I would have to disagree with",
          "I love a museum that draws me in from the outside; as soon as I saw the building I knew I wanted to see more. If you want traditional art, this is not the place for you. But if you want to be challenged with cutting edge images and be faced real-life images--some quite",
          "What an impressive modern building! The square in front of it is a skateboard paradise. I started on the top level with the punk exhibition, wondering how many of those around me lived through it. The music icons, such as Sex Pistols, Johnny Rotten, the Clash rocked the music",
          "The building alone is worth a visit. The punk exhibition was inlightning and Barbara Fraser solo show was very intelligent and insightful, it makes us see the world of culture in a different perspective. We always feel more cleaver after walking out your museum. Thanks!",
          "Visited here on Sunday. It cost \u20ac10 per person. The building itself is a masterpiece of architecture. Visited the exhibition on Punk, which was very interesting and another one on experiences - both very thought provoking.",
          "With so many great museums here this one was a waste of time. Dumpy, some of the items may have been completed last night,",
          "Rainy day in Barcelona, so hit up an indoor attraction. Reasonably priced compared to tother museums around Europe. Really industrial vibe sensed after you walk in the door. Loud, but thins out as you head through. All modern art, up through the most recent year. Non-art fans:",
          "The building is a beautiful contemporary architecture suitable for showcasing contemporary art. However, the exhibition is not attractive. It has deviated from artistic expression and gone to savage emotions. There are so many fantastic museums of modern art to visit in",
          "I had bought the art pass to six museums for 30 euros. Since I ended up going to 4 of them was a good buy. MACBA is a gorgeous white contemporary building with exhibits on three floors. Have a huge retrospective of the American artist Andrea Fraser who is a performance video",
          "Museum is awful. There was nothing eye catching! \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude2d So much better places to go, for example Gaudi museum",
          "Building nice from the outside,but exhibits are the worst I have ever seen in a museum.There was a very disturbing noise that went off every hour for a about 60-90 seconds. Staff pleasant but will not answer basic question. Do not buy 6 museum pass for 30 euros.",
          "The arts flourish in Spain so this museum should've had more if not better exhibits. Some were fine, while others were too regular. Space is amazing though as is the outside.",
          "I would recommend any art enthusiasts to swing by the museum as they have a good and relevant selection of contemporary work. From paintings (my interest), sculpture to video installations. The museum's array of work aims to discuss the art scene both of Spain and the different",
          "The current punk exhibit on the third floor is worth a visit as it includes agood overview of punk artists and their art...famous cases mentioned are the sex pistols and unknown artists were the t\u00f6dliche doris",
          "There were exhibitions of Punk and Andrea Fraser here when we visited. Not really our cup of tea, but we loved the building and some of the exhibits were thought-provoking. I especially liked the exhibit of a teachers salary slips over 40 years which showed by how little his",
          "The Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona\u202c is an average museum. The entry price is cheap compered to other cities in europe. No audioguide.",
          "We saved this museum for a rainy day but there was no need for that! The exhibits are interesting, especially the Andrea Fraser exhibit. We could have spent hours just exploring that. There are many good cafes nearby for a coffee or lunch.",
          "For a city like Barcelona one would think their contemporary art museum would be wonderful, but this one is more than lacking. I love foreign contemporary art museums, they tend to highlight different ideas and thoughts than others in the states, but this one was poorly curated",
          "OK, if you like a nice contemporary art building and odd collections of stuff come here. Some things were more interesting in retrospect, too. For example read about Angela Fraser before hand, so when you wander thru all the strange videos you can appreciate (or not...) her",
          "Firstly you need to wade through the skaters who have made the entire front of the museum their skate park/pot smoking haven and enter the gallery which does not fee air conditioned at all. Hand over your 10 Euro each and wander the two levels of 'art'. I love modern art and",
          "Contemporary art is always subjective but to a relative philistine like myself this was just poor - the building itself was interesting but the contents had me reaching for the bull ring which is a place I'd never visit. Try the Valencia contemporary museum - much more",
          "It's a bit hard to argue with some of the other reviewers. I found the building more interesting than the exhibits. If installation 'high concept' art is your thing, then you might get more out of it. It's not to say all exhibits left me cold, but more than 90% of it was the",
          "If you're into contemporary art, MACBA is a great place to experience this, with an emphasis on Catalonian and Mediterranean artists somehow missing from other big art museums. The building itself is interesting from an architectural point of view, and a nice place to enjoy the",
          "If you are into contemporary art this is a \"do not miss\" place in Barcelona. Not much to say really. I depends a lot on the exhibitions being showed. P.S - Just be careful when crossing the court to entrance. There lives a \"plague\" of skaters and i was almost run over twice by",
          "Interesting building and some very interesting, fun and engaging art. A sensory experience. Would be a good place to come with children.",
          "I never actually ended up going into the museum, but stumbled upon something sooooo much better. Right outside of the museum is a plaza that's basically a huge skate park, it was so awesome to see. People would sit and watch the skateboarders, drink a beer and chat with friends.",
          ".... installations, videos, photographs and hardly any paintings \u2013 then this would appeal. If not, don't bother, as it would just seem mostly weird and pseudy. We visited only because it was included in the Art Ticket BCN pass. The interior is spacious, with black+white d\u00e9cor,",
          "The collections are well-structured, the museum itself is a perfect space for a contemporary art collections. Pity that the specific mobile app was unavailable for Windows phones",
          "Loved this place. Loads of work to see. There was at least four exhibitions on when we visited. The bookshop was good too. If you're into contemporary art, go here.",
          "I was quite disappointed by this museum. It claims 3 floors, but is really only 1 plus 2 half floors. I found most of the exhibits boring and uninteresting - but then I'm not a great fan of contemporary art. If nothing else, it would be somewhere to keep dry when it's raining.",
          "Perhaps modern art just doesn't do it for me or maybe I like what I know? Unfortunately I found it hard to engage with the exhibitions in way that wasn't a problem at Tate Modern in London. It all seemed a bit of a jumble and too hard to make sense of....the skateboarders",
          "Most disappointing. We were looking forward to something different. It certainly was. Usually there is something interesting in any art gallery, but we must have missed it here. I feel a philistine being totally negative, but I could not recommend anything that I saw. A waste",
          "We'd visited particularly for the photographic exhibition depicting the changes in life in Barcelona. This was very good. Some of the other installations left me a bit cold but that's art, interpretations are so individual. It was great to see the staff holding sessions with",
          "The building is the star of the visit... The expositions at that moment a little bit 'average'... But anyway next time I will come back!!!",
          "So I opted to visit this museum because the Picasso museum is closed on Monday's. I made my way by foot absorbing the sites and taking some pictures, as I kept getting closer to the museum I noticed that the area kept getting a bit dirtier. I finally arrived at my destination",
          "Stopped by on a Monday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. The building is stunning and so well designed. The exhibitions were interesting, some of it maybe a bit out there for my taste but we enjoyed the visit.",
          "Least favourite of the art galleries.Some of the temporary exhibitions were good.I enjoyed the photographic exhibition.I liked the ground floor best.",
          "The building itself is interesting and beautiful. But MACBA was a complete disappointment. The exhibits were hard to appreciate. It was badly curated in my opinion. Paying 11 euros per person left us feeling ripped off. There was really not much to see. So in case you have",
          "The many skateboarders outside the museum, and I use the term museum generously, have the right idea. The interior is mostly a giant wheelchair ramp with a few niches where what some imbecile considers art is displayed. It's mostly acres of white walls that would be improved by",
          "This was my student son's idea to visit..... It did not start well, to access the museum you need to dodge the multitude of skateboarders that frequent both the access slope or stairs leading to the building. Dangerous is not the word. As we approached one unfortunately became",
          "Impressive, very modern art-like building. The exhibitions in July when we went were so-so, though. Just one of them was interesting and provocative (\u201cThe Beast and the Sovereign\u201d), the others were just utterly boring. I\u2019m not an art connoisseur by any means, but modern art",
          "Having been to 100's of museums over the last 40 years , I can safely say the quality of the work currently on display at the MACBA is a sad reflection of its director or curator. Miserachs photos have been blown up larger than life to mimic a theatre set , with sound and video",
          "I would sugggest to come here only if you have a little knowledge of contemporary art. Otherwise, it would not be super attractive.",
          "An inconsistent collection of artwork, not a particularly large one and not many famous artists, so definitely not comparable to the likes of the pompidou centre, however there are definitely some hidden gems to find. Each room has a different theme and some of them are better",
          "The building looks spectecular from inside and outside. Build by architect Richard Meier who made more great museums. The collection however was less intresting.. Not so modern as i would expect and they focus an local artists. I realy don't understand why lots of the",
          "Interesting modern art museum, but mind bending for the average man in the street. You really need to be into this scene to appreciate this stuff. That said, I enjoyed the visit and the work left an impression on me.",
          "Totally disappointing. Waste of money and time. Art was limited and poor quality. Building was more interesting. Save your money and give it a miss",
          "The MACBA building is absolutely stunning. Sadly, the same could not be said about the collection of art we saw during our visit in November 2015. There was a photography exhibition on the ground floor that was interesting and quite well thought-out, but the rest of the work on",
          "There is a mix of audio and visual arts, combining painting, sketches, video, recordings and other items which almost defy description. Not always beautiful or decorative but definitely interesting and displayed in an impressive, stark concrete building. I enjoyed the visit",
          "This building was amazing but the artist's exhibits were not to our liking. They change so who knows what will be shown in a month or too...Staff friendly and at 10 euros per person the entrance fee was acceptable.",
          "There was a lot of open space and the presentation was exceptional. But the art on display was perhaps not for me. I have been to many contemporary art collections across the globe. Sorry this was not at the same level.",
          "The thing with viewing Contemporary Art is that you're only as good as the current installation. This seemed particularly true for our visit, where there seemed an extensive study on building supplies. Interesting in the first viewing, but by the fourth room I wanted to just",
          "We spent a whole afternoon in this incredible museum. They had so many interesting, perfectly curated, diverse exhibitions that I couldn't even take them all in. I loved that they also showcased art from other cultures. The whole museum was also very accessible for non-Spanish",
          "The building functions well as both an exhibition space and artwork--as you look down from the higher floors, the seating in black, white and grey forms a constantly-changing composition. And the permanent hole \"art piece\" is fun. The shows change, we enjoyed the ones on when",
          "Just like an unsatisfactory meal. It looks promising but does not deliver.The interior is very grand and white,and more white. Vast spaces of wall....blank! Maybe a third of the building is actually galleries, so why the huge building ? An architects vanity project ? But someone",
          "Although I am not a fan of modern art, we ended up going to visit on a rainy day. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the exhibits and even found some things I liked.",
          "My wife and I went to this museum and were very disappointed because there does not seem to be a permanent collection of contemporary artists. We found temporary exhibits that were very disappointing. I would skip this museum and there are many more museums in Barcelona that",
          "It's an all right museum, but nothing extraordinary. If you only have a few days in Barcelona, it's not worth the visit. Very quick to go trough, and not so children friendly. I don't regret that we went, but I wouldn't recommend it.",
          "Exploring the space as well as finding all the treasures displayed inside was a welcome first stop in Barcelona. Open and interactive spaces and exhibits let the mind wander and relax. Common comfortable sitting areas allow visitors to process or recharge. Easy location to use",
          "Very spacious and airy interior lends itself well to the three floors of displays. The three on offer on our visit were diverse and thought provoking. A word of warning on walking to the museum is that externally it's uncontrolled with many skateboarders and smells of a certain",
          "The MACBA is a good museum for contemporary, yet it also know as one of the world famous street skating spot. My son is a skater and he wanted to go there so much, we went and we all enjoyed a really good show of skating abilities. recommend to go at evening when less people",

          "My wife and I have visited many art museums/galleries around the world and have rarely had such mixed feelings as we had when visiting this institution. First the good: the stark white building is well-designed and spacious with excellent display spaces. Also, even though we",
          "By far the worst Museum I have seen in my life. not worth the time spent in there. I had a Barcelona Card so I didn't pay an entrance fee thus if I had paid I would have asked for a refund. The worst art I have seen. They need to change the curator for sure",
          "For modern art lovers a must to visit. The architecture is already amazing and the exhibitions excellent organized.",
          "I'm not a huge fan of modern art but really enjoyed my visit to MACBA. The building itself is spectacular - White and spacious with plenty of room to breathe and enjoy the exhibits. Some were pretty strange but others struck a chord. A real mix of creative genres too. You'll",
          "This is the most exciting museum I've ever been to! I know that sounds gushing but the pieces on display and the way they have been displayed I found immensely stimulating and exciting. This is a museum that showcases ideas to awake tour imagination. Go visit.",
          "In terms of a museum, its full of 'quirky' art in my opinion. There are lots of different objects to look at. The art pieces are made out of different materials and each of them have their own story. It is worth a visit if you like contemporary art I suppose. The museum is",
          "Museum that is the center of the skate boarding. A lot of people skate, drink and smoke. You can sometimes see a professional skateboarder.",
          "We went to visit the museum with an invitation from the Social Media Manager. The museum has some very cool contemporary art structures, well exposed and from different artists. We were seated inside for a while enjoying the art but also the skateboarders showing their tricks",
          "The museum is a mixture of very contemporary art installations, curated with themes but without much explanation. The highlight I enjoyed most was the very large outdoor mural by Keith Haring (no ticket needed to see this outdoor mural). There were a large number of very",
          "I I spent 3 hours in the museum. The collections were very extensive and very worth the admission. I would have spent longer in the museum if I could. A must see for art and contemporary art lovers worldwide.",
          "MACBA - Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona is one of the modern attraction - if you are lucky, the next exposition is for you ;-)",
          "The building alone is worth the admission fee - white, minimalist, stylish. Some of the art is great too. One of the quirky things I liked about this place is there is a kind of crash/rest zone, with bean bags and large sofas to lay on when the art gets too much to process.",
          "This museum mostly consists of art installations in different theme-based setups. That's not really my thing, but I am glad I passed by it.",
          "I am very interested in contemporary art so I make a point of visiting contemporary art museums wherever I travel. I like to be provoked and confused and I like the unexpected flashes of insight that contemporary artists provide ... so I was looking forward to my Barcelona",
          "This Modern Art museum is nice but not the nicest that we have visited. If you did the Moma in NYC you will not be impressed. We are french and lots of pieces of art are not explained in french. So, please do your own experience.",
          "The building its self is very nice, and with lots of natural lights. The current exhibitions are amazing and really interesting. Really worth a visit.",
          "The worst museum of contemporary art I've ever visited. Went several times last 4 years and absolutely nothing of interest. Don't spend time and money to visit this place!",
          "Fantastic art museum, the design of the building is a piece of art itself, the different floors all have a fantastic selection of thought provoking art. I loved the space dolphins.",
          "I enjoyed visiting the MACBA, I like modern art so it was a nice stop! It is a nice set-up and roomy enough for lots of people. Luckily it wasn't crowded when I went. There are students discounts and it isn't pricey. There is some very cool stuff to see and some alright stuff.",
          "Despite the fact that such type of art is not my style, I had a really good moment there. Lucky me, at the ticket booth, they notified me that a free tour in English was starting within the next minutes. It helped me to understand much better the exhibit. Museum architecture",
          "The MACBA was closed on the Tuesday we planned on going (usually Mondays is the day when museums close in Barcelona). If this happens to you, consider going instead to the Centr of Contemporary Culture of Barcelona (CCCB) that opens on Tuesdays and is just around the corner.",
          "This place will definitely give you an alternative perspective and it is an interesting way to spend an afternoon.we were also surprised that there was no entrance fee. The collection is spread over several floors and rooms . Make sure that you download the apps and look for the",
          "I was, unfortunately, more impressed and interested by the architecture of the building than by the content of the museum. It was, also, quite expensive to enter. I recommend looking at the upcoming exhibitions before choosing to visit it. However, you should definitively pass",
          "I took my two kids (ages 9 and 11) to the MACBA and we just had an amazing time. I wasn't sure that they would like modern art - but they loved the installations, the videos and most of the exhibits. It's an amazing space and challenged my ideas and beliefs about what art is",
          "What a place to see art! The exhibits were well thought out, the building space was beautiful. Have a little siesta on the beanbags while contemplating what you've seen and the beautiful space. The bookstore was pretty great too, although I hope your Catalan is better than mine.",
          "A surprise 'art museum. Here you will meet artistic movements you never thought existed. The building is also odd and offbeat.",
          "We visited on our first day in Barcelona, we simply happened upon it and went in. Cost of admission was 10 euro per adult. The museum is laid out across three levels, with really interesting pieces in the galleries. It would not be the first thing on my list of things to do in",
          "The exhibits currently on at the MACBA are awful, I wouldn't waste the 10 euro entry fee. I like modern art but this was 3 floors of tosh",
          "The exhibition 'the beast and the souvereign' was interesting, but its theme was very philosophical and it is recommended to take the time to understand what the exhibition is about. Understanding the theme makes it much more interesting. Came actually to see a work of Genesis",
          "Wonderful Richard Mier Building in an old city. This was a great place to escape some afternoon showers, enjoy the art and walk the ramps of the buildings.",
          "Breezed thru due to not my taste in art on any of the 3 floors. Extensive curating went on and had lots of artist in show, yet didn't speak to me.",
          "There was much more to see in this museum than I had time for and one of the galleries was even closed. The work was VERY contemporary and i learned a lot and was exposed to many artists that I had never heard of before. Exhibits ranged from a group show to in depth research on",
          "We knew that many of the things we wanted to see in Barcelona were not open on Sunday so we made plans to spend a few hours at MACBA. The beauty of this building alone - inside and out - is worth the price of admission ($10 euros per person). With any contemporary art",
          "Not only is the museum excellent, with some of the most interesting stuccos in Europe (the have juxataposed modern art within the 1000 year old church frescos - learning how they transferred these from the churches and monasteries to save them is fascinating. But the real treat",
          "I can't say enough good things about this museum. It's gorgeous. The collections are thorough yet easy to navigate ( not like the Met in NYC). If you need a rest, there are comfortable sofas and there's free wifi. There are also lots of bathrooms and hardly anyone was there. It",
          "This is by far the worst... The first section I entered was like a porn store and seeing the others I thought maybe this place is created to make people hate modern art. I'm just glad that even this museum couldn't make me hate modern art. Go somewhere else, don't waste your",
          "My husband was particularly interested in seeing this building designed by Richard Myers. The building was very striking and offered an outdoor public space, mainly utilized by skateboarders. Inside the museum was interesting to start at the top and walk down ankled ramps to the",
          "If only we had read TripAdvisor going to this museum, we would have saved both time and money. The most interesting \"exhibit\" was essentially pornography, which was not remotely appropriate for most museum-goers and certainly not the large groups of schoolchildren we saw",
          "Macba's architect was a skateboarder. Obviously. This place is Mecca for woodpushers. It's hallowed ground. Go on a Tuesday or any evening after 7 for the full effect. Gift shop's alright too.",
          "The building is very nice and before knowing the exhibition inside you have the feeling that you will spend a very good time. Unfortunately collections are poor and if you look for sculptures or paintings just go back home. You will save 10 euros per person.",
          "The light-filled, all-white interior of the building is stunning and provides a perfect space for this gallery. New exhibits (usually thematic) are introduced regularly, so it's nice to come back. There is an eclectic mix of leftist, non-traditional, international, textual and",
          "This was a relatively small, but interesting museum. The exhibits were mostly temporary, and highly avant-garde. It is located just steps from the Rambla in a nice, spacious building. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "I chose to take a cultural break one afternoon and walked over to MACBA ( Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona ). Being from NY and having access to The Met and MoMA, among many other museums, wasn't sure what to expect. The experience was exceptional. The museum has attempted",
          "Unless you're accompanied by a philosopher and a hipster art critic, way too much for me and two teens. The building is gorgeous though. The current exhibits are too specialized in my opinion.",
          "Went there and was expecting interesting modern art. But the most interesting for me was the building itself. I would recommend reading about the exhibition before you enter and then enter only if you feel the exhibition is something that will interest you. Positive thing: quite",
          "We have always encountered this institution being closed when we tried to go in the past. We went after a late lunch at 1900 Bodega. Glad that we did. It is just large enough to make a special trip without an overwhelming amount of exhibitions. The theme during our visit was",
          "Big collection of some very strange items. In fact a couple of times we remarked to each other \"that was disturbing\". We found it by accident and because our Barcelona Card gave us free entry we thought we'd give it a try. All I can say is it will not be to everyone's taste. If",
          "As someone who loves Modern Art I would say I was slightly disappointed by the lack of good quality exhibitions here. What I saw was nice, but it seemed overly minimalistic which wasn't impressive. Sitting outside gazing at the skaters and smoking a cigarette in the sun was",

          "MACBA: Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona building by Richard Meier the facade, entrance and ramp are the best of the building, the rest not so great. I love contemporary art, did not like the exhibition they had at the time of my visit",
          "Went to this museum on a rainy day in Barcelona. It is very contemporary; the architecture, the art itself, etc. It is, after all, the contemporary art museum. With that said, I am not generally a fan of contemporary art...there were a lot of exhibits that looked like toddler",
          "Last time we visited Barcelona it was closed so we grabbed the opportunity to visit but we wish we hadn't! The building itself is stunning from a design and architect perspective but that's where the good ends! The actual exhibits and contents, I have to say, we thought were a",
          "Although this city is a beautiful one some elements spoil the overall enjoyment having spent a few days here and getting violated in public by pickpockets has put me off a further visit and also many of the students who have visited with me sadly this will have a ripple",
          "Art is taken very seriously here. It feels like a fridge like environment of Richard Meier's enormous edifice. Quite a contemporary art scene...have seen better.",
          "This is a very good contemporary art museum, of course you should only go if you like this type of art. For me it was perfect, with a great display and expositions.",
          "Take a hint from the avid skateboarders using the plaza outside and invite them inside for skating and the grafitti they may bring with them until the \"Museo\" can afford some art... Do not patronize this venue.",
          "The museum has 3 levels with 2 levels opened to the public. If anything displaying can be considered ART, I will be a great artist (I can't draw or paint). There were TVs showing things which I will considered not suitable for children and disguising to watch (people performing",
          "The building and gallery spaces are wonderful. We saw some skater art in a room we could see from one of the mezzanine hallways whilst also looking out through the glass at kids skateboarding in the square below. Some huge exhibition spaces over a number of floors. Some of the",
          "Look this is contemporary modern art however as you probably already worked out from my title - this art is SCARY!!! oh and confronting! The stuff i'd imagine nightmares consist of. I really found the art on display here disturbing!!!!. If this is your thing - then go for it,",
          "Here is a very charming spot in Barcelona, where a beautiful light white building serves as scenario for the manouvers and acrobacies of the 90ties-never-grown-up skaters of the town. While walking around the museum or having a drink in the neibourghood is higly recomended, I",
          "Perhaps if one of the exhibitions hadn't been closed for installation there would have been more of interest to see but as it was, the building itself was the highlight. Having enjoyed contemporary art museums in other European cities our expectations were not met.",
          "We visited in June and were impressed by the beautiful building. Not all the exhibitions appealed to us but some were really interesting. It depends if this is the sort of Art you like to view rather than the old masters you would see at the Prado or D'Orsey. The reception staff",
          "Nice building. We were surprised the friendly lady from ticket office spoke Dutch. We were happy that we had free entrance with our barcelona cards, so we were out in 10 minutes. The exhibitions did not appeal to us. That might be due to a lack of knowledge about contemporary",
          "I'll start with a positive; the building itself is beautiful. Modern, filled with natural light and easy to access if you're pushing a wheelchair. The contents however are another matter. This has to be the worst art museum I've ever visited. This is not art, its just plain",
          "The building is interesting but the exhibitions were uninspiring and boring. It certainly was not clever or make you think. To me it looked like they were just filling in the space with what ever they had. The skateboard riders outside the front were more interesting and the",
          "Even though the building had an amazing architecture, the expositions were not impressive, very uninspiring. We paid 10 euros each... Not worth it.",

          "I have to admit up front that I don't love contemporary art, but this was the only place open on Monday in Barcelona! We should have given it a miss - it was full of weird things, none of which we understood fully or understood at all. It is an amazing light filled building, but",
          "Light and fantastic architecture, fun crowd of skateboarders outside and nice woks outside. But building still is better then the exposition, I just stood inside in awe of how the light goes all around the halls.",
          "Sorry to record that our visit was hugely disappointing. We were expecting to find some cutting edge creative thought-provoking exhibits, but discovered only dusty amateur contributions. Surely the museum's board can do better than this! We wasted our time here. Don't waste",
          "I must echo the previous reviewers comments (Purpletigger) - I also enjoyed the building more than the exhibits. The modern architecture, the huge atrium and white walls added to our enjoyment. There were a range of exhibitions and some were very interesting but overall, I",
          "To be honest I enjoyed the building more than the exhibitions although they were well worth a visit.",
          "We had planned to spend the afternoon here, but only stayed about an hour. The architecture is worth a look - crisp, modern lines , great plays with light. But the exhibits currently on display were not to our taste, though others appeared to be enjoying them",
          "The museum of contemporary art is off the Rambla in a stunning modern building by Richard Meir built in 1992. I found the exhibits to be of intellectual rather than aesthetic interest and we went because we were in the neighborhood and it was included in the Articket. The few",
          "When you have seen more modern art museums, the MACBA might be a deception. Most rooms are too empty for the presentation. This doesn't increase focus, just echo. The collection consists mainly out of photo's and video's. Personally I would appreciated some extra fine arts.",
          "... modern art it should be OK. The building is colossal, and you can even become a part of the installation if you dive into lazy bags at the entrance - take a few minutes or even a nap :-)",
          "It was pretty small but I really enjoyed seeing the modern, graphic, and digital designs. The outside matched the inside as well. Tons of skateboarders outside which added to the modern vibe.",
          "Interesting building from the outside and nice foyer and columns in main hall - but that was it. A really really uninsprring and borring museum - i don't even know how they can remotelly justify the entrance price. One if the most disappointing experiences i have ever had and",
          "If there had been no entry fee I'd have still been disappointed. I've visited modern art museums in quite a few cities (such as London, Paris, Ghent and Nice), and while some of the content has left me cold, I've found much to mystify and inspire me. Not so here. The place is",
          "Huge building- really interesting space but nothing in it. The fact that it was nearly empty during peak hours makes you wonder how long it can keep going. There are so much better contemporary art galleries that don't have the advantage of this building. The curators need to",

          "The stark white building is interesting, but there is virtually no interesting art of any kind inside. I have been to many contemporary and modern art museums and this one sadly was a major disappointment. Perhaps Barcelona has a few too many art museums, and not the financing",
          "Worth a visit: if you like contemporary art, you won't be disappointed. The building itself is a piece of contemporary art, very dynamic and inspiring. The collection is precious and interesting, a plus was given to the occasion: La Merc\u00e9, the day of the Saint of Barcelona,",
          "Great exhibit you have to go to! @ least 2 hours for a good visit, a lot of pieces from early 20th century to now",
          "What an amazing place! Deserted on a sunny day, this building amazes. Extremely spacious, the collection comprises installations, photography, sculpture and more. Well worth a visit if you like cutting edge art that makes you think... Good value for money too.",

          "I visited the MACBA twice, both times there were excellent exhibitions. There are usually 3 different exhibitions at the same time. And it is contemporary art, which can be quite polarising. The building itself is worth visting as well. Same goes for the plaza were you find nice",
          "The best part about this museum is that seniors get in free. There was not a lot of art to be seen and it is very spread out. The other good thing about this place is that you can take photos without flash.",
          "We were very disapointed by this gallery. There seemed to be hardly anything in it. The content at the time of our visit was probably more relevant to Spanish people than to us as the main exhibition was a bit of angry social history by a local artist. The other exhibition was",
          "Great building, so just go inside, enjoy the architectural lines and hurry back outside, before you pay any entrance fee, because every Euro you pay is wasted money. Give it to one of the beggars outside, it will be better spent. There was not one -not one- piece of the",
          "Enjoyed our visit here. The building is amazing definitely a place to hang out. The leather bean bags are a nice touch. The exhibition was interesting a nice mix of permanent collection and special events. Worth a visit and free on a barcelona card",
          "I enjoyed my time at the gallery and the exhibits, but the biggest surprise during my two-hour visit was the building itself. The way that light enters it and plays on the inner surfaces is simply astounding. I took many great B&W photographs and kept most of them. As with most",
          "The venue is a beautiful modern gallery in the centre of El Reval, Barcelona. Easy walking from Barrio Gotico and La Rambla. Initially surprised by the \u20ac9 entry fee, we decided to head in and see what was on offer, having read that this was one of the places not to miss when in",
          "Architecturally the building was very cool. They had three main exhibits while I was there. All of which were very large and detailed. Also the three exhibits had a nice variation from subject matter and medium to giver viewer some diversity. I thought the Lawrence Weiner",
          "After visiting the MACBA, the only thing I can say is that it is very disappointing. The exhibitions in April were uninteresting. The only thing that is worth seeing is the buidling itself, but 9\u20ac just to see a nice building is what I call expensive... Don't waste your time and",
          "Macba is divided into three different sections, where the third section is temporary. I think your opinion and feelings about Macba depends on this temporary art exhibition. When I visited (april 2013) I was blown away. The art was amazing, where it showed current social issues.",
          "The architecture is stunning, and that in itself is well worth a visit. There were a number of temporary exhibitions on when I visited, and I enjoyed the variety this provided. The staff were really helpful - if you like contemporary art, you must visit.",
          "Brilliant gallery space with interesting exhibitions. Highlight seeing Hans Haacke's Condensation Cube. Institutional Critique at its best. Excellent accessibility.",
          "We spent a pair of hours visiting the MacBA : astounding architecture, really impressive and beautiful. Artists shown were... well, contemporary to say the least, as anyone would expect, so I won't share my feeling about the exhibitions on display that day. But the place is",
          "Lovely contemporary building, this museum features post-war Spanish artists. While I love art, including modern, there is just too much to do and see in Barcelona to spend the time and money here. If you have a week or less, spend the time on the Gaudi material, which is",
          "The Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art is located just off the Ramblas, and is a short walking distance from both Catalunya and Universitat metro stations. Exhibitions change on quite a regular basis, perfect if you are staying longer in Barcelona and are an avid art admirer.",
          "You may not respond well to contemproary art. However, the exhibits in this magnificent, light and airy building are worth seeing. I sometimes (perhaps unfairly) feel 'fobbed off' with a brush stroke here and a dot there. However, there was nothing superficial about any of the",
          "really liked the location and space the exhibits were just ok. i went with designers to get inspiration, and there was too much experimental art and video, and we just didn't get that much out of it one of the coolest parts was hanging out in front--lots of stylish (and good)",
          "MACBA does \" what it says on the tin\" . The range of contemporary works and formats exhibited by several artists can be variable and some artists will not appeal, but the MACBA is a museum we always visit in Barcelona ( about 5 times a year) . Entrance is free for those",
          "Its a faboulous building but is really poor inside and i disappointed a big part of the collection. Worth the visit if you have the articket card.",
          "Imagine a stereotypical modern art gallery that the simpson's would make fun of. It is dull, boring and there was even one piece that was just a black square on the wall. I tried, and I do like modern art, but this was obviously too deep for a simple mind like mind. Go on the",
          "if you are interested in Modern Art, you will like this place. For me, I cannot understand there exhibitions. Just a lot of TV screens with bunch of various Images... and series of pictures that i totally have no idea what it is.",
          "The building itself was the best part of this exhibition. Clean white lines with slopes and curves. There were only four rooms open at the time of visit. I don't speak Cataln and my Spanish is poor so the one room with a head phone interviews with the artists explaining their",
          "Enjoyed the exhibitions on at the time, however for the price tag is expensive for how small it is. The top floor was closed when we went, not sure if this is permanent.",
          "some nice paintings at lower level but what was moderna 100 years ago is today history....a bit expensive as everything of this kind in barcelona",
          "I enjoyed my visit to this museum, but the scope of the collection does not match other modern art museums like the Tate or the Pompidou center. The collections were also very meta - abstract thinking about the nature of art. On the plus side, they were well explained. I",
          "A wonderful place to visit while in Spain, it is a great stop to see everything Catalonia has to offer. You get TRUE SPAINISH CULTURE FREE. Look up various events and you may just find something for you to take in, such as a landmark speech or appearance.",
          "nice building into a really interesting pieces. nice exhibition, is not only the art pieces , but the building itself is calm and full of things to see",
          "Easy building to get around, and great space for the art. Fantastic room half way round with bean bags on floor and movies playing, 70's music/photos etc loved it as did our kids.",
          "The architect of this white and very zen buidling is Richard Meier, and once you enter it, you feel that he managed perfectly to bring serenity to this place, while giving the perfect light and space for the pieces of art to be enlighted. The exhibitions give you a good insight",
          "This seems to be a hit or miss depending upon the special exhibit of the day and one's personal taste. There are occasional conferences of interest as well.",
          "They had some installation art that wasn't my taste. The advertised (frommers) collections had been moved.",
          "The building is the best thing about this place, a beautiful modern white building with a lovely light feel. However the collections inside were disappointing. Some local photography and an architectural exhibition. No paintings or modern art. 8 euros entry. Brilliant",
          "The building design is wasteful and unimginative. The gallery space is limited and still has an emptiness, as if a small 3D piece should be exalted. Imagine showing Picasso when he was young and only showing 4pictures. The photo exhibit was very good.",
          "uneven quality of exhibitions but an overall great experience for arts professionals and aficionados",
          "The collection consists mostly of photography and video art, so if you are looking for other installations and modern sculpture you will be disappointed. If photo and video is exactly the art you like and you have some good knowledge of this type of art, MACBA might be worth a",
          "i was very disappointement with the exhibit. Poor and the ticket costed Euro8!!!",
          "Maybe its something in me. Spent a good couple of hours trying to get into this. Its for those that are in the know!",
          "The MACBA building is quite nice, full of light, and well constructed. The skateboarders in the square certainly seem to enjoy the courtyard and the exterior design as well. Exhibitions at all museums change frequently, so it's hard to rate a museum solely on a temporary",
          "Mostly photo's of 70's and 80's Barcelona went to get out of the rain but would rather have stayed outside and got wet.",
          "Very cool museum with an awesome photography exhibit on Barcelona street life. Worth checking out! Located in El Raval - definitely walk around the neighborhood after you've looked inside. There's some cool street art/graffiti, bakeries, and restaurants in the area.",
          "The MACBA is ok, but it's not the Centre Pompidou in Paris! The square in front of it is a great place for skateborders though.",
          "I've been to a squillion art museums and galleries internationally and this was by far the poorest one I've ever been to as far as experience and quality/number of exhibitions. A lot of money has been spent on a very grand building with very little content. The staff seemed",
          "The museum building is very dramatic with a ramp that runs the length of the building and gives access to all three floors--there are also stairs, I didn't notice an elevator. The work itself was varied and some was very good but there wasn't much of a permanent collection on",
          "The Musuem is in an accessible are ao fthe city, close to the Gothic quarters and Catalonia square, still it's rather quiet. It has a very interesting collection and organizes exhibits and events throughout the year, specially in summer, which include media displays and music.",
          "The MACBA building is located in Raval area which is not so great to start with. Apparently this was an attempt to kind of clean up the area though I am not sure if it works. The bright white building by Richard Meier is great and stands out not only in the area but in the whole",
          "The art is always worth seeing again! A good compilation of Picasso works.",
          "Interesting part of the city and a great building... everything was looking good until the moment when I went to look for the art collection. There is good contemporary art and there is rubbish contemporary art... well, probably 99% (or so) of the exhibits in the MACBA fall",
          "The MACBA museum had many types of art: paintings, sound, structures and much more! My kids said that it was boring but I thought that the art was very inspirational.",
          "One of my best days in Barcelona was walking in the rain to MACBA, in a nice neighborhood on the other side of the Ramblas with good restaurants. The museum was a good experience and my 16 year old had a lot to say about the art! Excellent bookstore next door - fun shops",
          "It was a great balance to visit this museum along with seeing some of Barcelona's older architecture and museums. There were two really interesting and interactive exhibitions on in October 2011 -- Between the Frames and Ribe. Very memorable.",
          "Beautiful beautiful gallery and challenging exhibitions. One of the highlights of our stay. Separate cafe near entrance (not associated) does tasty set lunch menu at 10 euros including wine or beer! Great art bookshop next door too. Cool MACBA key rings.",
          "almost everything displayed is considered art - a piece of stone, a line, garbage on the floor, a film of a naked man boxing by himself. If you like and appreciate that type of expressionist art, this is the place to be. It will stretch your imagination. We didn't enjoy it as",
          "very interesting exhibition on East European art, well documented, and with statistics on the entrance of east european art in institutions and collections.",
          "This is a must see if you are keen on art. Put at least 1 full day aside for this.",
          "I have never been so dismayed and depressed by an art gallery. Whoever put this exhibition of so-called art together should hang their heads in shame.",
          "The building is inspirational, and interesting an elegant space you just keep looking at. However, the art inside was just so way out. Is it art when it looks like someones made a mistake in drawing a cube? Can a row of blocks be considered Art? It's in the eye of the beholder I",
          "A more fabulous architectural space for art than this is hard to imagine ... only the Tate Modern London and MOMA NYC offer a similar experience and ambience - so perhaps the quality of the exhibitions are less spectacular than the former but this beautiful building more than",

          "So, you are visiting Barcelona for a couple days and you don't know if you should visit the museum... How to spend your time wisely? Should you go to the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art? Well, it depends. This is a fairly young museum (1995) and you may not find popular",
          "Stunning building, awful exhibitions. Any halfway decent commercial gallery in NYC has better stuff.",
          "This museum was utterly pretentious. We had a good laugh at the ridiculous self-importance of the art, but that's about it. The descriptions of the art were such B.S. that we actually took photos of that. For example, there was literally a film of a cat drinking a saucer of"

It has 3 levels and all of them tell their own story. Tip: take a good amount of time out of your day to explore the works, because there are so many of them! :)",

          "They were hosting a very interesting exhibition with works from the beginning of the 20th century till today. Intriguing location and surroundings.  The highlight is undoubtedly the skaters outside the museum.",
          "This place is really great, inside and out. It\u2019s got all things amazing art to look at on the inside, and incredible skateboarders to watch outside once you\u2019re done visiting. It\u2019s good coming in earlier in the morning to get more quiet time. Perfect place to visit on a sunny day!! :)",

          "A well organized exhibition. Anyone can understand the themes.  Takis' temporary exhibition on the basement worth visiting.",

          "While the friendly skaters outside is one reason to hang out in that square, the exhibition space is just as good. I was glad to check their exhibit on postcolonialism and it was quite well curated. I think the space itself (esp with the great bookshop attached to it) is the best museum I've seen in this city.",
          "I loved this museum. Take your time to enjoy the exhibitions, we will take two days to see the whole museum. It's very large, there are three floors with each their own exhibition. The building itself is also a piece of art. To me, this is something you must have seen visiting Barcelona.",
          "Love this. Very interesting. Will be back again on my next vacation.",

          "For art lovers, especially of contemporary works, it\u2019s a very worthwhile experience. On our visit we saw a well curated political criticism in an architecturally noteworthy building. The adjacent skateboard park made us appreciate the spirit of civic and cultural awareness that contributes to why Barcelona is so special.",
          "Good museum of Contemporary Art. Located in El Raval, emblematic quarter in Barcelona. The building is awesome (Meier). The visitor is supposed to know the main ideas of artistic and historical facts or could be lost during the visit. \u2026",

The works on display was labelled for multiple languages that made it easy for me to understand each piece. If I came to Barcelona again, I would love to go",

          "Waste of time and money. Half of the museum was closed, the other part very uninteresting and with hardly any artwork. The only good thing are the skateboarders outside but you really don't have to pay 11\u20ac to see their stunts. Staff was rude.",

          "Lovely exhibitions. My friend enjoyed them a lot even tho he's not a fan of contemporary art. The info is short and very basic in a positive way - you get a good overview what happened in the decades that are shown. Also the building is spacious and fits well the art.",
          "best museum in bcn. best gift shop of a museum in Spain. lovely staff. excellent temporary exhibitions.",
          "It was very limited. When I hear modern art museum I expect sth like Tate but it wasn\u2019t like that at all",
          "Hip & cool. You can see many people skating & dancing",
          "Wow, 8,5\u20ac to look at weird stuff and see what a child could have made. I did not like it. If i knew how it would have been, i would not consider going there. At least the big chalkboard was nice.",
          "Modern and contemporary museum in a fun little area. One floor was closed but otherwise worth checking out",
          "A great museum of modern art. I liked how the collection is structured in terms of chronology of history events. The art is often a reflexition of events. So as you enter different halls you can read what events were happening in the world \u2026",
          "Beautiful architecture by Richard Meier. Went to this place on Saturday. Free admission every Saturday 4.00 pm onwards",
          "Very elementary, american culture history museum. In Spain, until 1975 you were sent to mental hospital for life if you were a real free artists",
          "A must-visit in my view. As any museum of contemporary art it depicts effectively the recent steps and achievements of Barcelona, in art and history of art, thus local culture. The specific museum includes a lot of historical and political \u2026",
          "Didn\u2019t make it into the museum, came here for the skate spots though! First visit was the first Sunday of the month, so it was completely packed!!! Came back a week later and it was much less busy and we could sit and enjoy watching all the skate boarders! Totally worth the visit if you\u2019re a fan of this spot.",
          "Not the easiest to get around as not much direction but a good visit all the same",
          "It's really amazing try seeing it your self!",
          "Excellent collections that get you thinking. Very spacious environment with multimedia facilities. Three different collections on when we visited for about 2 hours.",
          "The collection is quite ordinary but the building and its setting in the middle of old Barcelona is something worth to experience",
          "This was a really cool museum with an emphasis on audio visual contributions for the most park. Would recommend.",
          "cool place inside and outside. Great exhibitions, extraordinary building for art gallery or a museum. Its free entrance every Saturday after 3 pm. One of the MUST places to visit when you are in Barcelona. 100% recommended",
          "It looks nice, unfortunately the whole 1st floor was close and we couldn\u2019t visit the main collection. I would have been nice if the guys told us before to enter,or on the website.",
          "The world famous MACBA. Amazing location. The finest skateboarding on the planet.",
          "Not that cool, for a huge place like that i was wondering something more..\nPoor and not really entertainer. Probably going there with some exposition is better",
          "Rude staff too busy on their phones, no signs anywhere! Spent ages wandering around!! Shop is lovely though!",
          "Great exhibition in a building with beautiful architecture which also gives you a great view of the surrounding streets. Drinks in the cafe were also great",
          "Looked cool but didn't go in",
          "Disappointed. Was expecting great things from a well-known museum in this wonderful city. Ordinary at best, often mediocre, certainly hard work. Still believe Barcelona is a wonderful city to visit and enjoy.",
          "Ok - nice venue but limited popular contemporary artists. Receptionists were also too busy chatting to serve! Cool gift shop.",
          "Architecturally speaking, this is a masterpiece form Richard Meier, that would be the first attractive. The museum hosts contemporary art if that's your thing. I give it four stars because the outside of the building has decayed immensely due to poor maintenance and has been vandalized by skaters and other local species.",
          "Very good museum, nice exhibitions. Outside there are a lot of skateboarders to watch. Clean an accessible museum. Worth the time. Does not take to long go through, but it's big enough to enjoy. Part of it was closed when we were there.",
          "Nice. It's a large building but there is not a whole lot to look at. Stays open late so if you need something to do for two hours or less.. this is a good museum",
          "Great exterior\u2014hot spot for all the skaters!",
          "Great museum to visit if you are in the area. Perhaps a few more exhibitions would've been great, as there is only three. Would have liked to have seen more.",

          "Beautiful building but the exterior area is not that welcoming with a lot of skaters and quite some garbage",

          "Great place to visit for contemporary art lovers. They have multiple floors with exhibitions divided by the years in which they were created. You can get a free ticket if you have Barcelona City Card. In general, museum did worth time and money we've spent.",
          "Absolutely amazing museum and area surrounding it that becomes a cool spot to hang out in the evenings",
          "Disappointing, even for the free ticket price. I want a refund of my time. The tate modern in Britain is a lot better. There were some interesting works, but overall it was small and disappointing",
          "The museum is modern and accessible with wheelchair. The staff is very friendly and speaks englisch.",
          "One of my fav places in Barcelona",
          "Great exhibitions and a photographer's dream if you like street photography! Come catch the skate crowds. I came on a free admission afternoon and thoughit was crowded, I enjoyed my time here",
          "Nice museum with diverse exhibitions. The museum app (MACBA app) is a nice tool helping understanding more :)",
          "There were some beautiful pieces to witness. My favorite exhibit would be the two gongs matter and spirit that are interactive and make low resonating sound. You can walk around and witness everything in about an hour or take your time and \u2026",
          "Some stuff sometimes repetitive, but also sometimes important(international) events show up! Friendly workers and manager.",
          "I'm going to be completely honest it is very heavy. Most of the rooms are filled with art that is leaning more towards politic other rooms are just straight up creepy.\n\n! Note ! There was a room that is pitch black where you are supposed to \u2026",
          "In 1959, art critic Alexandre Cirici Pellicer formed a group of contemporary artists showing work in a series of 23 exhibitions with the hopes of beginning a collection for a new contemporary art museum in Barcelona. It was not until 1986 \u2026",
          "Only for biggest fans od Modern culture",
          "Got to see amazing art by great artists.",
          "Always love coming here! There is a review of the 20th century on the first floor with cultural specialties of each decade separately, displaying posters, art pieces, video and sound installations of relevant artists across Europe.\nThe \u2026",
          "Fantastic skating saw someone trying a nollie tre down the big 3 block, hope he got the make.",
          "Whilst not the No.1 fan of contemporary art, I  appreciate the anarchist/individual tone.  MACBA is in a funky space, a magnet for skateboarders, and is free Saturday 4-8pm. Worth the trip.",
          "Good art. Nice feel with the people skating in front. But mostly good art.",
          "Vert good exhibitions.",
          "The 'art' of the skateboard outside is as entertaining as the art Inside.",
          "Nice place to spend a Saturday afternoon. Free all Saturdays from 16h00 to 20h00.",
          "If you're into the absurd genre of contemporary modern art, this museum is well worth a visit. As a casual museum goer, I enjoyed the crazy effort put into the art, such as one art piece in a completely dark room that could only be viewed after waiting 15 minutes for my eyes to adjust.",
          "I had just expected more because it was talked up to me for so long but with such much hype, sometimes comes disappointment because expectations are set too high. Plus a lot of the art just felt like someone trying to make new art out of \u2026",
          "Good stuff, great stuff and definitely lots of weird stuff. Go have a look, 10 euro entrance, can do the lot in 1,5 to 2 hours easily. Exit through the gift shop. Don't expect big names.",
          "They need to check their hours on Google.  Bought the ArtTicket, only to walk up and find them CLOSED.",
          "Best place in bcn for culture",
          "Simply amazing. Beautiful collection. A must for anyone in Barcelona.",
          "Free on saturday afternoons from 4pm. That was a good thing, but not a very interesting collection.",
          "Always worth a visit, lots to see, clean bright roomy galleries.",
          "Impressive space with lots of light, good to spend a little time here exploring the exhibitions and building. There are usually some brilliant exhibitions on here and its a nice space either way!",
          "The contemporsry exhibition and collection is amazing, the museum shop is also another great point!",
          "This place has a great energy, for the lovers of skateboarding, this is really your style",
          "Probably one of the most happy and alive place I ever seen in a city.",
          "The architecture and interior design is quite phenomenal, an experience itself. However, the exhibited art and collection is rather poor / mediocre. No well-known artist (which is not a problem for myself) but also the mostly local artists \u2026",
          "A little bit hot inside. Maybe for the direct sunlight in the common zones. The building in my opinion has a good circulation.",
          "Pretty nice museam with weird stuff and an historical corridor at the third floor that will bring your memory from the comunist age till the WWI.",
          "I didn't go inside. But the plaza area itself is a magnet. Music festivals. Skaters. The nearby cafes offer great eats and drinks for great prices. The bookstore has a lot of reading material pertaining to modern art, feminism and children. I enjoyed hanging out at Kiko's while my son skated with friends.",
          "Fantastic museum in a great location and awesome artwork and pieces",
          "Great place to learn about the history of Barcelona.",
          "The museam is fine, the perfect place for skateboarding. But be carefull, tgerecare a lot of thiefs",
          "Stunning piece of architecture and great place to take a moment to relax and watch skaters do their thing:)",
          "There is so much to see, it's just not my cup of tea. But respect the talented artists exhibitions.",
          "Great place with a nice balcony to watch the skateboarders below\ud83e\udd18",
          "I didn\u2019t find the art here engaging. It\u2019s the kind of opaque contemporary art that requires you to read long explanations. The front desk staff member (bald guy with glasses) wouldn\u2019t answer my questions about the museum, only saying \u201cyou \u2026",
          "Best spot to ride",
          "Been here on the nights museum,  very nice event, a lot of people and very interesting.  Really recommend.",
          "Not for everyone, but if you like modern art, you can spend 2-3 hours here",
          "Fascinating museum. Don't miss the famous graffiti artists work on outside walls.",
          "Great building, but at the time I was first floor was closed, and on ground and second floor was really boring presentations. Not worth money I payed.",
          "Waste of money, rude staff, half of museum was closed. Save 11\u20ac, buy a drink and char with skaters outside.",
          "best thing we visited in Barcelona .\nso well curated that it was a study in itself .\ninspirational and evocative \nno queue to speak off so possibly avoid some of the sites with more hype and just enjoy",
          "Junky people all over.",
          "Great, even for small kids",
          "I recommend to modern art lovers the most. The exhibition is interesting, not covered with exhibits. Amazing space around the building.",
          "I enjoyed it, rest of the family hated it, but that's contemporary art for you. They all were talking about a particular piece they liked though. Win.",
          "Takis exhibition is totally worth visiting",
          "I were expecting to be better",
          "Didnt feel the art, the art felt me.",
          "I loved this collection!",
          "It's great place for skateboarders. Little bit noisy area because of that. However, museum, designed by Richard Meier, give full of experience of light, space and contemporary art exhibition.",
          "Very easy to get o via public transport. There was lots to look at and to do. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Barcelona",
          "Decent collection of art, got in for free as it was after (I think) 4pm, would have not been impressed if I had paid but hoody for free.",
          "There was long que outside. We decided not to wait. I am sure place is great.",
          "Quite expensive beer bit really good location",
          "Heaven for art lovers.",
          "I visited Jaume's exhibition. It was really interesting and moving. \nGenerally it is a modern space with a garden area as well, I would visit it again.",
          "Lovely place to visit",
          "the best museum experience ever. we were lucky enough to see 20 dancers from 20 countries performing visual art from 20th century in the hallways of the museum this weekend. I hope that one day it will become a part of regular exhibition",
          "Such an interesting and beautiful museum.",
          "Beautiful building. Good location. Exhibits are average not exciting. The reason I gave 4 not 3 stars due to its surroundings with lively skateboarding folks.",
          "A very moving collection of exhibitions. I wish the layout was more thought out. It seems a lot of space is wasted on the foyer/lobby",
          "Great experience. My wife, who is an art teacher, loved it. We spent 2 hours there",
          "Really loved it, amazing architecture and some amazing exhibitions.",
          "Do not miss the Keith Haring mural outside.",
          "Absolutely loved it, make sure you have plenty of time to spend",
          "One of the best museum I know (and I've visited 200+ museums worldwide)",
          "MACBA is one of the must visit places when visiting Barcelona.",
          "I really battled to get into any of the artists minds to see art in some of these exhibitions. Really large expanses of open space with rather random abstract items every now and again. If you have a barcelona card its free so its a great place to chill out and it has a really great gift shop.",
          "A rich of collection! Love it!",
          "I turned up on a Saturday afternoon and found it was free entrance. The museum is a great space. It depends on your taste as to whether you enjoy the very well documented and curated exhibitions.",
          "Contemporary, NOT \"modern\" art. Be warned. Political commentaries and really \"out there\" stuff such as as a dark room. Some bits WERE ?interesting   e.g., large constructions made of tiny toy soldiers...",
          "A contemporary architecture with complete glass facade that gives the building a very stylish look. There is public bikes stop in front of it. The square is full of live at night. Grops of teenagers an youth play , skate, and have loud fun with drinks.",
          "The building is really beautiful but unfortunately I didn\u2019t like the museum, not well organized. I expected something more.",
          "Interesting contemporary art. The museum itself is very nice and well organized. The art presented is top.",
          "Nice place, must pop in once in Barcelona, not overloaded, nicely displayed, carefully selected .",
          "Great place to hang out with skaters and other local gangsters!",
          "Well worth a visit!",
          "I didn't understand anything but it was cool",
          "Very beatiful museum. Interactive exhibition is great. People are awesome",
          "Absolutely amazing exhibits. Highly recommend going here when you are in Barcelona! Also, kids under 13 are free!",
          "Very contemporary...some interesting exhibitions, but a very vast space for too little exhibitions. Just my opinion. Not my favorite contemporary art museum...",
          "Don't miss it! Always a good place to taste, smell and  touch contemporary art.",
          "inspiring architecture, the exhibitions focus on the kind of art that is heavy on concepts but does not offer much for the senses. If you like to spend time reading long descriptions while pondering postcolonialist implications of a painting on a wall that shows a wall, you'll feel right at home. Great air conditioning.",
          "Good but smaller than I thought it would be. Jaume Plensa exhibit was excellent",
          "The resident collection lacks in depth and quantity. The only positive note is I got in for free, because every Saturday afternoon the museum is access free. The temporary exhibition by Jaume Plensa was interesting.",
          "Nice, but mostly doll works.",
          "Greaaaaaat modern, contemporary art",
          "Building has great architecture. The current exhibitions are very inspiring. Also appreciate there seem to be special activities for young children. Art for everyone. The only drawback may be the entry is not cheap so it may not be really \u2026",
          "Lovely and not too big. Loved the 1968 exhibition.",
          "The exhibition of the sculptures of Jaime Plensa are riveting, dramatic. Well worth a visit.",
          "Fantastic place for modern and contemporary art",
          "If you like contemporary art, this place is worth a visit. The building itself is a beautiful modern structure and they change their exhibits a lot which is nice.",
          "Art is a bit hit and miss and depends if you like that sort of thing. I found some of it stunning. Equally, some of the rooms I walked through pretty quickly. Five stars because the building itself is stunning.",
          "Cos my daddy loves art and i love my daddy",
          "Great museum, well worth the price. The building itself is also amazing.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. I loved seeing the Jaume Plensa exhibit. Plensa is from Barcelona. Interesting and varied collection and some artworks are connected to Barcelona.The Museum has rooms that go with a modern art timeline. Helping you understand the history of modern art in Spain and in the art world",
          "This is a stunning museum, that is without question but that is where my positivity ends. Idon't think I am a modern art lover but I have grown up in an artistic family and know skill and talent when I see it. Some of the art either I just \u2026",
          "A place to relax in the sun, whilst watching skaters practice their skills. We came here twice and is close to Las Ramblas and some mosques. \n\nWe did not go inside the museum this time round, maybe next time.",
          "Amazing expozitions. If you are in for art, must see sight! Amazing building, awesome architecture!",
          "Nice place to be ! European skateboard capital \ud83e\udd19",
          "Amazing building and exhibition (i went to a Jaume plensa one).  Worth visiting the building itself",
          "If you visit Barcelona and you like art, don\u2019t miss the MACBA.  Today I had the pleasure to see a variety of exhibitions among them a summary of the past years and it was very interesting.  But what impressed me the most was the sculptures exhibition by Jaume Plensa.  Follow his art - it\u2019s amazing. Here are some examples",
          "I'm an art geek, so all my gallery reviews are going to be glowing, or amusing. This place has something for everyone, including tech, science, governance and crime geeks. The Forensic Architecture exhibition was enthralling. Loved every minute of my time in the space. Bright, cool, clean. Such a great show. ",
          "Very good art, not easy to understand though.",
          "I enjoyed the visit very much. A short conversation with very helpful staff who gave me some idea about the museum. Then three exhibitions. Two hours passed in the blink of an eye. Highly recommended place!",
          "wonderful museum .",
          "I visited the Stanley Kubrick exhibition here and was blown away by the space, how they arranged the information and shared the different forms of media. I have not seen nothing else here yet, but I highly suggest the experience based of my one visit",
          "I expected more from such a place!!! Third floor closed with no sign before entering",
          "Highly recommend it. You should check the free museum days.",
          "There are very few exhibits here. Entering the pavilion is forced to put a green sticker on the body. It is honest to say that it is a silly rule.",
          "God museum , the line was a bit long to enter and it was crowded inside , I like the permanent exhibition but I've seen better",
          "This is a really nice museum... love architecture and awesome expositions",
          "2 artist exhibits, each w own floor. No permanent exhibits, at least I don't think. 2 exhibitions...Interesting, not 'wow,' but that is more up to individual taste. One was woman, lesser well known from Beat NYC. Enjoyed most projection of \u2026",
          "Fantastic skate scene. Skaters everywhere.",
          "The museum is in the middle of Barcelona and sorrounded by some cafes. The price for students is okay, and there is art in three floors. It's very bright and peaceful, but the contemporary art was not mine. Besides that, the place in front is a skaters legendary heaven.",
          "There are very few actual pieces of art, it is more a political display than an art display. Very disappointed looks like kids made the exhibits for a school project.",
          "Great! As a black American I felt connected to the exhibit.",
          "Fantastic! Loved it! Really great building. Exhibits were striking. Highly recommend.",
          "A must go when visiting Barcelona. Nothing else to add. Also, It is worth the price. You won't be disappointed.",
          "Great museum size to explore in 1-2 hours without being overwhelming. Exhibits spread over 3 floors (2 open during my visit) in large airy spaces and modern, minalmist building featuring international artists and movements. \u20ac10 entrance \u2026",
          "Not the best modern art museum, but there were some interesting pieces. Best to check what exhibition is on before going.",
          "Free entry on Sundays after 3pm",
          "You call this art?!?!?!? One of the worst museums I\u2019ve ever been to.  Very boring uninteresting exhibitions.  I would not call this art.  Total waste of time and money.",
          "Interesting exhibits, definitely with a political spin. The curation of the pieces is a bit odd. It is kind of difficult for English speakers to understand the different exhibits and why they are categorized in a certain way. I did like the \u2026",
          "I interesting exhibitions sometimes",
          "Street Skate spot, good place to hang out for skate boarders",
          "Great art exhibition of Jaume Plensa - apr 2019",
          "Love skaters everywhere",
          "Very  cool - the building has a nice layout and it\u2019s easy to not get lost. All the exhibits were interesting. \u2764\ufe0f",
          "This place is a waste of time. I cannot believe i paid 8 euros as a student here. There is literally nothing interesting to see. I am walking in a big white space of nothing. The only good thing is there is ac.",
          "Boaring and mostly non understandable\nGo somwhere else",
          "Skaters love this place",
          "Beautiful place. Ain't entered",
          "Hipster Heaven. Unique Exhibits within a beautiful modern building.",
          "Enjoyable way to spend some time. The building is spacious and the rooms offer a place to contemplate new ideas. As a non Spanish reader, it was difficult to access much of the literature on display, though we did enjoy what we saw.",
          "This place is an awesome meeting point, lots of sk8ers and other tribes getting together to share a beer and joint",
          "Is the best place to have a beer with friends.  A place where skaters group up to practice.",
          "Best skate / chill spot in barca until mossos police arrives 0:00",
          "Definitely a location for those who *really* enjoy contemporary art. Floor 0's display of the MACBA's own collection is a must see and features many great contemporary artists. The upper floors are fantastic exhibits, but the average museum-goer might find it a bit irregular.",
          "Great modern and contemporary art Museum. Totally recommended!",
          "I enjoyed the recent exhibition a lot:) You can get a discount if you have a teacher's license.",
          "Very interesting (: \nWell built.",
          "Great contemporary art museum.  Perfect to get out of the sun",
          "Wonderful architecture!",
          "Very beautiful building itself. As to me, visting is more preferable, than Gaudi's.",
          "Perfect place for hanging out with friends and family.",
          "I was expecting this museum to be immersive, impressive and out of this world but we found it just meh. The building is nice and modern but the art is unfortunately bland and boring. The collection as a whole also had no unifying theme; it \u2026",
          "Easy access, nice building. Pretty crowded on fridays",
          "Really dangerous area. Be carefull!",
          "The place in itself is interesting enough to buy a ticket. The exhibition were all very interesting with a mix of very known artists and discoveries. Though it was mainly artists from the 70's, so if you're looking for something fresh try the CCB instead.",
          "Nice modern art museum. Impressive Spanish modern art collection.",
          "Cool museum however I\u2019m concerned about the pay of the workers. When I visited in September/October there was a strike going on because the museum staff were underpaid. I mean it\u2019s not like the museum has many other labor costs - happy \u2026",
          "Nice skate spot",
          "Skip during our visit the only art on display was videos",
          "The biggest skate spot in BCN",
          "An extensive collection of thought provoking exhibits for a very reasonable price.",
          "Contemporary art is a joke.  Don't paint a 6'x6' canvas all in beige and say that it represents more than images itself.  The detailed descriptions of the most abstract installations were far too embellished; It's a gutter on a wall, not a representation of finite resources . Too expensive.",
          "It's a beautiful building but most of the expositions and art are not my cup of tea.",
          "As for me, a lot too weird thing))",
          "I felt like it was a waste of money and time. For an ordinary tourist like me it seemed like a bunch of meaningless and random stuff thrown in a pretty building. We didn't even have the pantience to see all of it. Maybe it would mean a lot more for someone who generally appreciates this kind of art, but not for me.",
          "Great collections. The building itself is a piece of art too. Saturday afternoons is free.",
          "The building itself is big and very different from the other ones in the area. The inside... Well, quite disappointing.. Some expositions are OK, but the museum itself feels empty...",
          "This white building of character for having in its main square the most important meeting place of skaters in the city and the most talented skaters. Inside art works and exhibitions",
          "Free and beautiful",
          "A place to visit and enjoy the biutifull art works.",
          "Had an excellent opportunity to enjoy Jaume Plensa exhibition!",
          "Free wifi, great spot to skate. I have never seen the art inside though.",
          "Just superb. Love the area of Barcelona it is situated too making the whole visit really enjoyable",
          "Oh boy! Difficult to rate. First, let me start by saying that I didn't enjoy this place, but admittedly I'm not a huge fan of modern art. \n\nIf you love contemporary art, you'll probably love this place. If you're not into it, then obviously \u2026",
          "Awesome space",
          "It was ok -.quite expensive for.what was in it",
          "Nice museum, but not the most impressive I saw for contemporary art.",
          "Wondeful. Huge museum with lots of exhibitions.",
          "Was not very excited about exhibits. If you\u2018ve seen already a lot in Barcelona, maybe you can go there as well but if you have limited time, do something different",
          "Very nice building with a permanent exhibition that is worth it. The different other exhibitions were not really interesting in my opinion, but still not so boring neither so it may be a matter of tastes.",
          "Great place of interest...",
          "Visit a \"Dark Room\" when you go. Very unexpected. Jaume Plensa exhibit/installation was fun.",
          "Great place to visit on a rainy day. Came here by accident but were pleasantly surprised because of the unique performances and exhibitions.",
          "One floor was closed, others were pretty empty and confusing to navigate. Not worth the 20euro entry that day at least.",
          "I always enjoy watching the skaters in the museum's placa.",
          "Great museum and if you go on Tuesday when they are closed you can see some of the best skateboarders in Barcelona and the world!",
          "I really enjoyed my experience. I was surprised by the social justice focus of the museum. Thought provoking in many ways. Especially since the workers are on strike. Definitely a must see in my book.",
          "Wode collection of contemporary art. Spent here few hour's",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed spending a few hours in the MACBA. I went Saturday when it is free. It was fairly empty so the rooms were not filled to the point where you cannot enjoy the art and installations. Favourite piece of out the timeline of MACBA was definitely Joan Rabascall's Atomic Kiss.",
          "Nice museum, great exhibits. Price was cheap, and tickets last for a month. Also, there's a really good area to catch local skaters outside. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "A diverse eclectic collection. Only true scholars will do more than a quick visit. The experience is in the name.",
          "EUROPE famous place for skate",
          "Why am I here? Because I stupidly bought the Barcelona card, which gives me free entrance. I can't understand a bit of things here. I can't even distinguish where a chair is for exhibition or I can put my ass on it. The only thing I like \u2026",
          "Great exhibit for those who like modern art. Some areas lack an explanation in English but overall a good place to visit. Not top of the list of BCN tho'.",
          "Don't miss this museum particularly if they have a temporary exhibition. I was there for Plensa",
          "Permanent exposition is really tasteless",
          "I really enjoyed the space here. All the action happening around the building contributes to this place getting 5 stars. The place is one of Barcelonas biggest public skate spots. The museum is a very interesting building as well. Definitely worth a look ",
          "Great museum. Great environment around the building with lovely places and squares around and inside it. Interesting backyard from where you can see the BCN skyline and sea.",
          "My wife made me go. It was just okay.",
          "Nice art thing",
          "The museum will give you an interesting overview of contemporary art. You will see some piece of Tapies, Basquiat, and Mir\u00f2. They have a good library with relevant art book. \nI give a 4/5 because people in the reception are rude and not friendly. They make you feel you are a retarded tourist and you annoy them.",
          "Really cool exhibits and interesting art",
          "This contemporary art museum was wonderful! When I visited this museum my favorite was the forensic Architecture exhibit!\n\nI know that the exhibits change up, but when you go a lot 2 to 3 hours to get through all the floors! I read almost \u2026",
          "Nice modern art museum. The building is great with ramps that you can walk up. There exhibit are very modern.",
          "There is no map at entrance on explanation about expositions, floors...a bit confusing. Nice building and there is a square in front of where the skaters practice and with bars",
          "I was lucky enough to view the Rosemarie Castaro retrospective in February. It\u2019s really a stunning museum and the exhibit was very well arranged and you guided through the aesthetic and cultural ideas with such grace. The text that \u2026",
          "If NY is well know for the MoMA. Barcelona has the Moca. Stanley Kubrick for now",
          "The museum was very good, showing a historical representstion of modern Spansih history from 1920s onwards.\nHowever, the timeline was not in English and although there were some maps to read about it, they were not available.\n\nAs a result \u2026",
          "The worst contemporary art museum I\u2019ve ever seen. Boring and obvious. The building and the book shop are the only things that are worth the visit. The skateboarders outside were also fun to watch.",
          "Unfortunately I didn\u2019t come inside the museum because I arrived there late.. but I saw the square in front the building and it is beautiful. Not for architecture or plants but because the people: girls and boys skating, rapping etc. Go there with a serveza and stay with them on plain air",
          "Not all descriptions are in English and the translated book wasn't available. Cool things too look at however.",
          "If your interested in science",
          "Love this museum, excellent expos, great activities - performances, concerts, conferences, films.... And i also love the congregation of skateboarders, hiphoppers and other active and non-active hangers-outers that occurs every day in front of this museum. Great atmosphere.",
          "There is so much here to explore. Great place for adults kids not so much.",
          "Beautiful Museum with interesting temporary expostion.\nReally beautiful the building too.\nAmazing the Square in front of the Museum at the apero time: full of skaters, creating beautiful \"open air\" art.",
          "Not an art fan. Didnt go inside. Its nice to look at. And if you skate or smoke, its the place to go. You dont even need your own weed to get high, just passively inhale the air from the students smoke. Dont let that put you off going though. They are all friendly.",
          "A very nice and spacious museum with a great showcase of contemporary art. Among the permanent collection, there's a few works by the famous and bigs like Wharhol and Jean Michel Basquiat and also very interesting collection like art during the Spanish Civil War and feminist movement.",
          "Great architecture outside & inside. What is exposed is well presented. Will you like anyway the art? Not that sure",
          "Museum was spacious clean and well organised. But art it self was terrible! Imo",
          "Not enough written about the work in English to have any idea what the work is meant to represent. Especially true for floor 1 and 2. Cool building though",
          "Very underwhelmed based on the hype. If I could go back in time I would have prioritized the Picasso museum.",
          "I really loved the overall atmosphere outside, where the place is always buzzing with life, as well as on the inside, because the building itself has such a beautiful architechture.\nThe exhibitions are set up very professionally, but are \u2026",
          "A fascinating museum, but somewhat high priced",
          "If you like contemporary art,which I have decided I don't- emporers new clothes ! The building is great.  The surrounding district exciting.",
          "Beautiful museum. great art. good architecture and atmosphere",
          "other wonderful museum in Barcelona",
          "Wonderful architecture building.",

          "Good museum! Nice executions but too much skaters around haha",
          "The best place to skaters of the word! Epic!!",
          "One of the nicest modern art museums I've ever been to. Nice quiet atmosphere, really interesting and fun exhibitions. Would have loved to have stayed longer but we ran out of stuff to look at.",
          "Worth a visit even if you're not into contemporary art.",
          "Modern building. Good collections.",
          "A must visit for everyone who like film, comic and the occult!  Very very nice what they got going on there!",
          "Must see while in Barcelona!",
          "We went to visit the museum with an invitation from the Social Media Manager.\nThe museum has some very cool contemporary art structures, well exposed and from different artists. We were seated inside for a while enjoying the art but also \u2026",
          "Would have hoped to see greater variety of art exhibits. Several exhibits were political in nature. The building is interesting enough. There was a strike going on at the time of visit.",
          "Fabulous contemporary art gallery. Needed more time to fully explore.",
          "Super sk8 ing",
          "Three floors, one of them was closed, which means I saw only two thirds of the museums. If they would have notified me, I wouldn't go in. Some art works were good, but most weren't jaw droppers...",
          "Very cool and smart exhibition",
          "Cute place. I won a bag with there logo",
          "Interesting museum. Must be seen",
          "Nice, modern building compared to most of what you experience in Barcelona. I don't think there is a permanent exhibition so the experience will really depend on the exhibits when you visit. I wasn't taken much with what I saw.",
          "Amazing modern building in the old part of the city, definitely it does worth a visit. In the square and the yard in the back there are bars where to have a drink or some tapas",
          "Interesting exhibitions and urban atmosphere outside with skatters!",
          "Super awesome spot to skate and hang out!",
          "Good, very stark.",
          "One of the top contemporary museums in the World.",
          "Nice place for chilling with your friends. You also get the company of professional skaters around you.",
          "For people who are into modern art or modern artists and trends - for classical, stick to Prado museum \ud83d\ude06",
          "Was in and out in 5 minutes. Nothing interesting for me to see :/",
          "Very cool museum",
          "Can understand nothing...No guidence at all",
          "Amazing place, great audio for events. 150 people fit nicely. Lights and setup is just great.",
          "That's my spot. The skating Arena of Barcelona !",
          "Interesting End of the World exhibit, but I would say a little overstreched. There are some good points they make and make you think of your own life and the impact you have on the world and what your relationship to food and clothes and \u2026",
          "Went, realized modern art isn't my favorite type of art. But nonetheless was very fun very relaxing. Great thing to do if you just want to kill time. ",
          "Great museums with a good collection and exhibitions. The building alone is worth to see and is very beautiful. Make sure to visit the bookshop!",
          "Beautiful and quaint environment.\nThe square is the landmark for artists, skaters, graffiti artists and companies who want to spend time enjoying themselves together.\nPerfect to spend a different afternoon than usual.",
          "Overrated! I don't think it is worth the trouble and the time.",
          "Ok",
          "Easily my favourite place to go and chill. Outside, you'll see tons of skaters showing off their tricks. Inside, the building is minimalist, with extremely thought-provoking art. It is an amazing place to take photos. Behind the museum you \u2026",
          "A true masterpiece of modern architecture, that keeps you connected with the outside through transparent glass facade. Besides that the museum created a public space in which you can see the youth enjoy their time in day sunlight. ",
          "Amazing very interesting would visit",
          "Great coffee and pastries!",
          "Really big and interesting contemporary art museum",
          "Very interesting forensic architecture exhibition when I visited, but I found the majority of the exhibits a bit lackluster. Considering they operate a rotation this may have just been bad luck. Wonderful and airy building which affords great views of the square below where skaters congregate.",
          "Good bye relatively small",
          "Worth checking out, though about half of it is whatever current exhibition is so worth looking at what is on before visit. Great shop on site. Popular spot for skaters outside.",
          "Be prepared to wait in line. And wait. Buying a ticket online doesn't let you skip the line. The line. The line.",
          "Best museum in Barcelona",
          "Not good.  I hope they spend my 10\u20ac on buying some decent art.",
          "I really enjoyed my time there. A lot of interesting objects. Three stories of art.",
          "Beautiful building, great space, gorgeous light and loads of explanations about the art on the walls. \n\nHowever, the collection really didn't do it for us - it felt too academic, too cold, too much like the narrative of the art world \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit",
          "Found all eyes in the app , but they refused to give me the prize. I spent about an hour to do that. Really disappointed",
          "Beautiful museum! Very nice expositions.",
          "Interesting, for everybody. \nVery nice building",
          "Interes5ing challenging pieces.  Definately outside the box.  Some seemed dated because these trends are used commercially all over the USA but it was great to see by whom &  where the trends started in the 50's, 60's ....etc.",
          "For an art illiterate like me, this museum was pretty interesting! Full of abstract displays. Love it!",
          "All artworks are presented in Catal\u00e1n, Spanish and English",

          "....boring...If you\u2019ve already visited some museums for example in Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Lisbon, etc. this is boring.\nTake into consideration that I don\u2019t go crazy for the contemporary art",
          "Provocative, socially conscious contemporary art in a beautiful space. Discounts are available for educators. Don't forget to check out the restored Keith Haring mural just outside the museum.",

          "Loved the museum and Plensa exhibition",
          "The Forensic Architecture exhibit just blew my mind. Alternately enlightening and depressing, it was not at all what I expected. A cool museum overall, but lacking some depth. A good deal for 10\u20ac.",
          "Empty place . Nothing to see... just pay 11 \u20ac as a gift for this museum.. I had a big disappointment here. I don\u2019t recommend to anyone",
          "Nice, cool, millenials",

          "Spanish,french anda english guides inside, should see !",
          "Nice to check it",
          "Love that the exposition highlights Catalonian artists and the actual problems of the area. The building is impressive, the ticket is valid for a month. If you have a press pass, you have to write in advance to get a free access",

          "Interesting place to visit. Free online saturdays",

          "Maybe it\u2019s just me but I do not like the art very much. The place is accommodating, but to be honest, I\u2019d rather be sitting outside watching the skaters and dancers, which is exactly what I did.",

          "Top",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 (Catalan: Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Centre d'Estudis d'Art Contemporani) ([fund\u0259si\u02c8o \u0292u\u02c8am mi\u02c8\u027eo], \"Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation, Centre of Studies of Contemporary Art\") is a museum of modern art honoring Joan Mir\u00f3 located on the hill called Montju\u00efc in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for the foundation was made in 1968 by Joan Mir\u00f3. Mir\u00f3 formed the foundation with his friend Joan Prats. Mir\u00f3 wanted to create a new building that would encourage particularly younger artists to experiment with contemporary art. The building was designed by Josep Llu\u00eds Sert to ensure that this work could also be made available to the public and exhibited. He designed the building with courtyards and terraces and to create a natural path for visitors to move through the building.\nBuilding began on the mountain of Montju\u00efc and the foundation opened on 10 June 1975. Not only was the architect a close friend of Mir\u00f3 but so was the first president Joaquim Gomis and Mir\u00f3 was amongst the first board. It was claimed that the new foundation represented a new way of viewing the concept of a museum and how the people of Barcelona could relate to their cultural heritage.\n\nExpansion in 1986 to the building added an auditorium and a library which holds some of the 10,000 items in the Foundation and Mir\u00f3's collection.\n\n\n== Works by Joan Mir\u00f3 ==\nMany of the works in the building were donated by the artist himself. Highlights include:\n\nThe wing of the lark ..., 1967\nHermitage of San Juan Huerta, 1917\nStreet Pedralbes, 1917\nPortrait of a boy, 1919\nPainting (the white gloves), 1925\nFlame in space and Naked woman, 1932\nCharacter, 1934\nMan and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement, 1935\nNaked woman climbing a staircase, 1937\nNo, 1937\nThe Morning Star, 1940\nBarcelona Series, 1944\nThe Diamond smiles at twilight, 1947\u20131948\nThe Caress of a Bird, 1967\nThe gold of the azure, 1967\nPainting on white to a solitary cell I, II, III, 1968\nFigure in front of the sun, 1968\nCatalan peasant by moonlight, 1968\nMir\u00f3's Chicago, 1968\nCharacter, 1970, May 1968, 1968\u20131973\nTapestry of the Fundaci\u00f3, 1979\n\n\n== Collection ==\nIn line with Mir\u00f3's original idea the Foundation has a space named \"Espai 13\" which is dedicated to promoting the work of young experimental artists. Although there is also work by Peter Greenaway, Chillida, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Rothko, T\u00e0pies and Saura.\nThe collection includes Alexander Calder's 4 Wings and Mercury Fountain. The Mercury Fountain uses the liquid metal mercury to create a fountain. As mercury is poisonous, the fountain is kept behind glass to protect the visitors.The museum uses QRpedia to allow visitors to read Wikipedia articles about objects in the collection, translated into their preferred language.\n\n\n== Espai 13 ==\nThe Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 has had a space for exhibiting contemporary art, with regular and continuous programming. Espai 10, active since 1978, and Espai 13, which took over after 1989 to continue through to the present day, together offer an area of analysis that is unique within Spain and also Europe as a whole. This exhibition space has been working as a laboratory of\ncutting-edge art, a space for programming experimental exhibitions of contemporary art, and has functioned over more than three decades in a major institution as an art centre within an institution. Besides providing a venue for local artists, it has also been a place of constant international interchange. Moreover, the broad span of over thirty years has made it possible not only to analyse the history of movements, patterns and trends in art but also to detect intersections between different generations and languages. In brief, Espai 10 and Espai 13 provide a privileged place from which to study, moreover, the ways in which theories and socio-political contexts have kept influencing artistic production over the decades when the different kinds of infrastructure that opened up the field of contemporary Spanish and Catalan art were taking shape. Hence, the history of Espai 10 and Espai 13 may be viewed as that of a well-informed witness, or an archive that can be compared and contrasted with many others from the same period.\n\n\n== Venue hire and private visits ==\nDifferent spaces can be rented for the celebration of events and activities. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 provides the perfect setting for all sorts of private and corporate events. The building and its gardens with views overlooking Barcelona offer exceptional spaces for holding meetings and company events. In addition, the Fundaci\u00f3 offers exclusive private tours of the different rooms in the museum featuring the largest collection of Mir\u00f3\u2019s work in the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Barcelona\nJoan Mir\u00f3: The Ladder of Escape\nFundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3 in Mallorca\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum website\nVenue hire and private visits\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The minute you walk up and see the Miro sculptures on the grassy area, it's a sight to see. Very contemporary in design, houses one of the best collections of Miro. An assortment of very large canvases and small ones too. Best to go through with a tour guide or the head set is",
          "Such a small exhibition left me dissapointed! Yard and outside objects was locked. Pathetic Espai 13. Inquire if its all open by call before having an idea to go there. For the ticket price of 13 Eur it is not worth visiting.",
          "I am a long-time huge fan of Joan Miro and I loved the Fundacio. I have been before and would go again. It was my husband\u2019s first trip to Barcelona (not a big fan of the artist) and he was glad that he went. The skip the line tickets made entry quite quick and easy. Note: these",
          "Lovely walk up through the park, not suitable if you have walking problems. We did this gallery after the National art museum. Check to see if fountains are operational- sadly not on our visit.",
          "Very nice museum! To do for those that like Mir\u00f3\u2019s work. You can Easley spend half a day there, the museum is surrounded by green areas so nice for a picnic. The museum has a \u201cresting area\u201d for kids in the middle of the visit!",
          "We had a very interesting and satisfying visit to this fabulous building, looking down on the city, surrounded by parkland. The art was representative and beautifully displayed, some outside. Lunch is reasonably priced and perhaps your plate might also be presented as a Miro",
          "There is so much of Joan Miro's work here from early paintings, dramatic large canvases and intriguing sculpture displayed clearly over multiple levels and outside areas.",
          "Excellent museum for Miro lovers. Paintings, sculptures and other works of arts. Outdoor and indoor as well. Great place to visit.",
          "After getting all the way up to see this museum, paying the ridiculous 20 bucks, more for the audio, we were treated to a screaming staff member. Lady with the red hair,giving the audio, you ruined my day. You made my daughter cry. I saw you being cruel to the French students",
          "But you really need to enjoy this type of art. I really wanted to visit and my husband tagged along. Ticket prices for seniors are more than reasonable. The permanent collection is incredible as is the architecture of the building itself. Very well signed throughout. The",
          "We enjoyed seeing the evolution of work at this museum and the influence on other artists. While not the greatest art museum we've visited, this was perfectly nice. We enjoyed the rooftop and terraces, and found the mercury fountain fascinating. Worth a trip if you purchase the",

          "A large white, open plan building on Montjuic houses an impressive collection of paintings and sculptures of Joan Miro. His works are colorful and abstract. Enjoyed the sculptures \u201cMoon, Sun and One Star\u201d on the terrace and \u201cPair of Lovers playing with Almond Blossoms\u201d.",

I get overwhelmed in the huge ones and don\u2019t know what to see and what to skip. This museum was curated while Mir\u00f3 was",
          "Perhaps it's because we visited the Mir\u00f3 museum after the Picasso museum, but I found the Mir\u00f3 collection to be paltry. And there were no displays or additional information available about the life and career of Mir\u00f3. However, the location is beautiful--fantastic views of the",

          "Any museum dedicated to one artist has a significant disadvantage. It is tricky to enjoy if that artist isn't a particular favourite! In my case Miro doesn't quite \"do it\" but I nevertheless enjoyed the extensive collection which I thought to be well displayed and presented.",
          "Enjoyed touring the rooms and the roof and gadens of this small museum. Excellent display of Miro's works",
          "It's peaceful, it's quiet, it's eye-appealing, it's comprehensive. Nice shop, nice restaurant. If you are a fan of Miro, you are guaranteed to love it. If you are uncertain, go and I bet you'll become a fan. It's fun to look at!",

          "Really good multimedia guide for an extra 5\u20ac that fully explains all the works. Not too crowded, plenty of seats to contemplate from as well. Definite must for modern art fans.",
          "Everyone has seen a Miro - even if you don't think you have, you have. A very successful artist in his own lifetime Miro became an icon of Spanish culture the world over. Yet his paintings have always been very open to interpretation - and this is where the power of his work",
          "This is a wonderful Joan Miro museum in a fantastic building. The roof sculptures are interesting, too.",
          "If you don't like Miro, don't go. But if you do, you will enjoy this medium sized museum. Aside from the art, the building on its own is interesting too. And as a bonus there is the neat mercury fountain by Caulder. A quirky fountain that uses mercury a the fountain's",

          "The architectural beauty and spareness is also on Montjuk hill overlooking the city and ocean and it is worth a good afternoon. The iconoclastic and colorful paintings are explained in words and video at various points in the building. His life and work was truly a shaking of",
          "If you are on foot walking down from the castle, make sure you have good directions! Once we got to the museum we had a meal while overlooking the garden in back. The museum has a variety of pieces by Miro and some contemporaries, with an educational audiotour you should not",

          "I do like me some Miro, but this collection was quite the letdown. A lot of paintings, yes. But they look to me like they were all whipped up at the same time to fulfill a contractual obligation or something. If you have a museum pass maybe pop in, but I really wouldn't",
          "Never knew much about Joan Miro but was blown away by all his works. This is definitely one of Barcelona's gems; a must visit if you like contemporary art and sculpture; and very different from the more traditional art museums in Barcelona.",
          "I didn't like Miro artwork before I came here because I didn't have an appreciation for it. After going through this museum with the audioguide, I understand more the thought process behind his works and it was interesting to see how he developed as an artist and what were some",
          "I did not have time to visit the Fundacio Joan Miro when I visited Barcelona last year so i was more that delighted to have the chance to spend a thoroughly enjoyable morning in the company of work by this wonderfully expressive artist, The galleries were well laid out with",
          "I arrived in Barcelona with the intention of visiting the Picasso and Joan Miro Museums - I gave up on Picasso, no matter how early I arrived there was a long queue so I headed off to the Joan Miro Museum. I was the third person in the queue and had a great couple of hours",
          "I did not really know much about Miro before we visited but this spacious gallery really displays his work in the best light. There are 2 floors and 19 galleries which display the work in chronological order. Very nice courtyard cafe and shops. You can also go up on the roof",
          "This is an interesting museum that houses a lot of funny sculptures by Joan Miro. Some of the tapestries are nice and some paintings too arty for me to understand..",
          "Paintings, sculptures, roof top garden with spectacular view. Cafe for the weary or hungry. Library, gift shop",
          "I had no idea that there was a museum of Joan Miro in Barcelona, but when found out I put it on my list of thing to do, even though it was situated a little far from the rest of our planned activities. First of al I got here by foot from the metro, it is quite a climb so take",
          "Wife and I stumbled across the Moro museum while on a tour of Barcelona and opted to go in rather than find our way to nearby Fort Montju\u00efc. Good choice - not in the least because it is air conditioned! We saw much of the art at MOMA-N.Y. many years ago, but is was inspiring",
          "Very comprehensive display and explanation on joan miro\u2019s work. Simply amazing and i used the barcelona pass to enter.",
          "The space is beautiful and interactive for kids. My son really enjoyed the outdoor space and the kids interactive room towards the end of the museum.",
          "This is a great place to take a break from the Gothic and Catalan architecture and arts. For those who love modern art, Joan Miro is a legend in pioneering and influencing much of the arts. The museum did a great job showcasing Miro's versatility and transition into different",
          "Loved the modern abstract art. The museum laid out brilliantly and we spent about 2 hours here. The biggest and only problem is the walk up the hill to get here OH MY. But the views from the balcony are to die for. Again, trust me....take a cab up here.",
          "Great museum, great building and great view. From the garden you can see the whole city. You can go or leave from there with the cable car.Is not far.",
          "Joan Miro Foundation in Barceu is a must visit IF you like Miro! As he is one of my favourite artists I truly enjoyed the visit. I cannot say the same for my wife thought which she also likes his work but.... in small doses!",
          "Another one for the Barna card, free in with it. No queues, not too busy, well laid out and kids can roam freely. Nice to combine with a visit to to other things around Montju\u00efc.",
          "This museum has artwork which spans Mir\u00f3's creative life. There are paintings, sketches, woven artwork, metal sculptures. Works by a few other artists are presented as well. The audio tour was very helpful. And the view from the museum over Barcelona is lovely.",
          "The building was amazing, the art work covered all phases of Miro's career and put his later wilder work in context. Nice sunny cafe, too.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this small but well-presented gallery. The exhibition includes paintings, tapestries and sculptures, including some early landscapes which I really liked. We also really liked the Calder mercury fountain (on show behind glass to protect visitors). Good",
          "Its nice place to see the art of Joan Miro. Im not so crazy over his actual art, but the museum itself is great.",
          "The architecture - outer and inner layout - is amazing. It is interesting to view the progress of Miro as he went from small formats to larger than life formats. Also, the influence of other 19th and 20th century artists in Miro's work. His apparent love for color is undeniable.",
          "I have been here several times and never tire of the well curated gallery that covers so much of Miros work. They change the temporary exhibition space regularly which is also good as you get to see a variety of contemporary artists. The roof area not only has wonderful",
          "I love Miro's art. My husband hated it. It's pretty weird, so you have to want to go here. A little out of the way but if you like art and can stand the Modern Art, you might like it.",
          "Nice collection of the artists works. I wish they had more of a selection to choose from for being able to buy some of his works as postcards or small cards. None of my favourites were there. It would also be nice to have a few photos or replicas of his most famous works here",
          "Born in Barcelona in 1893, Joan Mir\u00f3 is one of the most celebrated artists to hail from the Catalan capital. A painter, ceramicist and sculptor, he is famous for his somewhat surrealist designs which are reminiscent of childhood drawings. His pallet is rich in primary colours",
          "Why this kind of museums praise themselves of having hundreds or thousands of works of art and show soo little. Wasting space on unwanted special exhibitions on some kind of nobodies. Visitors like me go there and pay entrance fee to see works of Mir\u00f3 and as many as possible.",
          "Beautiful building and landscape. Artwork was large scale. Don't forget to go to the roof for a nice view and photo op.",
          "We 4 looked at each other and wondered why we chose to spend our afternoon looking at art we didn\u2019t understand or find particularly good. Pretty building, one very nice Calder but otherwise .....",
          "I didnt know much about Joan Miro\u00b4s art before coming to Barcelona. But now I love it. Fanatastic gallery with great artwork.",
          "If you like visiting art galleries, and especially if you like Miro, I would highly recommend this. I am a BIG Miro fan, so this was a must-do during my visit to Barcelona, and it did not disappoint. A gorgeous collection, in perfectly suited surroundings. It's worth a little",
          "Located on Montjuic, this gallery can be approached by using the funicular or buses 55 and 150. For those with their own transport there is parking available. It should be noted that the gallery is not open on Monday except public holidays and there are restricted opening hours",
          "If you like modern art and Miro, this is a great museum w/many of his most famous works --- ranging from his earliest to latest work. The architecture of the museum works very well with the collection",
          "Perhaps we're just not sophisticated enough, but Miro's artwork wasn't at all impressive to us. One example - a blue dot on an otherwise white canvas, really? The Calder Mercury Fountain was very cool though. We liked the Dali Museum in Figures so much better.",
          "Beautiful location on Montjuic. I'm not super familiar with Miro's work (or at least I wasn't when I visited), yet I found this visit to be amazing. Highly recommended if you're looking for art in Barcelona.",
          "We only have seen the permanent exhibition of the museum. It has not too much artwork of Miro in my opinion or at least not the better-known works but the exhibition was a nice experience and had a good atmosphere!",
          "I visited the Fundacio Joan Miro on my last day in Barcelona. It was a wonderful way to spend a few hours, enjoying the interesting works of art and also a splendid view of the city. I bought quite a few souvenirs in the gift shop - they are not the usual Barcelona knick-knacks!",
          "I think if you love Miro, you'll love this, and if you don't love Miro, you just won't get this. I loved it. Neat building and just incredible art. Wish the outside had been available on a rainy day, just so we could see his sculptures up close.",
          "I don't count myself as a great Miro fan but I really enjoyed the visit. Here is chance to see the development of his work from a young age and to have a bit of an insight into the factors that influenced him. An amazing array of his work in all its its modalities through",
          "This is good to visit if you're an art lover, or if you wanna have the full picture of the modernismo and why Barcelona looks the way it does, or if you have already done everything else and have time left. It is a bit out of the way, although the hop-on-hop-off bus stops there.",
          "it was a complete waste of time, what we saw inside we couldn't even call it art, some painting have only one scratch mark or only one dot, I didn't see any creativity in any of the painting, wondering how this artist manage to get a name whereas million of street artist are",
          "This is a museum with an excellent, focused collection, in an attractive building. It is just the right size for a visit. By the time I was ready to stop, unable to absorb more, we had gone to the end.",
          "I hadn't been to this museum in over 25 years and enjoyed returning. Nice selection of art work and sculpture. My 12 year old was not impressed with his work.",
          "Miro was a 'modern artist' so it might not appeal to all and whilst I am more of a traditionalist I found plenty here to like. The gallery comprises large white rooms with plenty of space to view the art work, which is sympathetically lit to show off the works at their best. It",
          "To visit any of the museums in Barcelona you should buy the all museum pass. We did not find out about it until after we bought tickets to Fundacio Joan Miro. The museum and displays were very well done and enjoyable and the locationin the hills is very interesting to walk",
          "This is a museum of modern art honoring Joan Mir\u00f3 (1893-1983), a Catalan artist. It is located on the hill called Montju\u00efc in Barcelona. We took the green metro line (L3) to Parallel, then switched to the funicular (included in the metro ticket) up to Montjuic, then turn right",
          "Our initial plan was to stroll around Montjuic and the cable car brought us here. It is a wonderful mid-day stop when the sun is hot or it is raining. Cafe and bookshop delightful. Art is memorable. Highly recommended",
          "a good size museum. not too big, not too small. wonderful setting and view. we were disappointed as the terrace was closed and we couldn't view the sculptures there.",
          "The Joan Miro Museum was nice. The surroundings compete in meeting one's need to watch beautiful scenery.",
          "Fundacio was a nice visit and value for money compared to other Barcelo a sites. Some excellent views of the city as well. The Miro exhibits were interesting but as always the picture explanations were pretentious and unnecessary.",
          "The entrance was free when we visited the museum. The kids loved it! All the colors and different techniques made it exciting! Miro is a great artist and the exhibition nicely set.",
          "4th Barcelona visit, 4th Miro visit. The setting, architecture, and of course art make this one of my happy places.",
          "Not a must see unless you are a big Miro fan, the best part of the museum is the great view from the roof.",
          "Glad we took a taxi to the Miro Museum as it is up a steep hill. My Partner picked this Museum and he made a good choice. We were rewarded with minimal crowds and used a audio guide from the Museum. Miro was a surrealist so be prepared \ud83d\ude00 The audio guide really helped us",
          "A glass and concrete modern building housing works mostly by Miro, though there are a few other artists represented as well. It therefore aids your enjoyment if you are a fan of the artists work. I find it distinctive and recognisable, but I am not sure I understand it. For me,",
          "I happen to be a big Joan Mir\u00f2 fan so I sought out this museum, but don't miss it! It is so worth it to see all the pieces I hadn't seen before, particularly the sculptures, all in one location. It's smaller than all the other very worth Barcelona museums, without the crowds,",
          "If you're on your first visit to Barcelona this gallery is a must visit. Not only for the chronological and stunning collection of Miro art works, but also the amazing architecture of the foundation building itself, which is set in the beautiful surroundings of the Mont Juic",
          "Located in the mountain of Montjuic in a building of rationalist style, designed jointly by the artist Joan Mir\u00f3 and by the architect Josep Llu\u00eds Sert. You can contemplate the exhibition of the most representative work of Mir\u00f3, temporary exhibitions and from the terrace a",
          "Full video review on YouTube by the TravelClast The Miro Foundation is located in a beautiful park above the city, and holds a rare collection of the famous artists more colorful pieces, including some breathtaking tapestries that we didn't even know existed. Even more rare is",
          "What a beautiful museum, art gallery, building. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d been to Barcelona so many times and never visited it. Do yourself a favour and go. I took the audio guide for \u20ac5 more and it was totally worth it.",
          "Interesting exhibit of the artist work. Great views of the terrace. Mediocre customer service and less than mediocre audio guide.",
          "Even if you are not a fan of Miro you may become one after visiting . What a lovely presentation of Miro's work in a space as interesting as the works inside.",
          "A joyful place with a wonderful collection. Take the metro to the funicular to the top. Then a short walk to this wonderful museum. nice views from the terrace as well. Admission was included in our Barcelona card.",
          "Plato was thinking of beauty as a reminiscence from the past. Hegel as the reunion of form and content. Not sure where Miro sits, or if any artist has an existence after C\u00e9zanne\u2019s intensity ? For sure, his colourful search is enlightening, but for the rest, is it Art or",
          "We visited this museum by chance. However we were glad we stumbled across it as we found it extremely interesting. There are some excellent works inside and despite the fact not all of them would appeal to too many people, they are nevertheless, stunning. Joan Mir\u00f3 himself was",
          "I\u2019m not a particularly big fan of Juan Miro, but I really enjoyed this museum. Like the Picasso Museum and others, you can see the transition these artists took from traditional painting into the abstract and similar modern forms. But my favorite part were the temporary",
          "We've seen Miro's artwork before, but never like this. The physical space lent itself beautifully to the mass of tourists; we could focus completely on the art. Two hours flew by.... Love the hanging tapestry. Recommend taking the footpath down the mountain afterwards to view",
          "I enjoy Miro\u2019s art - so was chuffed to see his work, it is beautifully displayed space give to his larger pieces. A great opportunity to learn more about the man and his work. Stunning location.",
          "We really like Joan Miro and as you may expect, we saw more of his art than what we\u2019ve seen in all other museums combined. Would recommend to anyone who likes the arrest.",
          "Cost a bit too much for what it is. I am not a modern art lover but this was just awful. Most art was scribbles with pretentious titles (2+5=7). The art I will remember the most is a blue dot on a giant white canvas taking up half a wall, then 3 similar sized white canvass with",
          "We spent 2 highly enjoyable hours touring this lovely museum in the Montju\u00efc area. Audio guide was very useful in appreciating Miro\u2019s creativity and genius. Also, the gardens and surrounding pathways add to the museum\u2019s appeal. Highly recommend for those who want to learn more",
          "Well worth the trip up the hill to see Mir\u00f3 Museum's collection; plus there are the gardens to visit and the cable car nearby, whcih is also fun to do.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this deep dive into Mir\u00f3. Perhaps not for everyone but if you like modern art this is a must. Get the audio tour- more than you ever wanted to know about a brilliant and unusual artist",
          "You should visit the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation because it is an amazing collection and a beautiful building. You can see an excellent Miro's paintings and other contemporary pieces like Calder's Mercury fountain. You shouldn't miss the fabulous views of the city from the upper",
          "Went as passing following a trip to Montjuic. Thought Miro would be interesting, but left a fan. Definitely worth going.",
          "This gallery is a hike to the top of the mountain, but a great collection of the artist's work in a beautiful setting. I was surprised to find his best pottery work was actually in the Museum of Design many kilometres away.",
          "Well worth a two hour visit, this museum (near Montjuic Park and the Olympic stadium on the elevated area south of main tourist areas) should be strongly considered during a visit to Barcelona. It relates the work of Joan Miro to periods in his life, with a large collection of",
          "We made a mistake and decided it looked like a short walk from the port. The walk was vertical and we probably should have approached from the other end where the escalators are. I wouldn\u2019t have made the effort for anyone but Miro. Wonderfull gallery and a beautifully appointed",
          "This is a must if you are visiting Barcelona and you like Miro. It's an amazing place to visit also very close to the Stadium. I enjoyed the architecture of the museum too. Si te gusta Miro este es un lugar que no se debe perder. Muy bello y especial",
          "Great examples of Miro's painting and sculptures. Pleasant cafe for snack or you can have full lunch in the dining area, complete with wine and tablecloths. Gift shop very pricey.",
          "We took the \"old\" (1905) funicular (\"telefericos de Barcelona\" -- the red and white cars) up the hill (Montjuic). A spectular ride for 11 euros -- but not for the faint-hearted/scared of heights -- with great views of the city. Step off the cable car and walk along the road, a",
          "Even if Miro isn't your taste, this museum is very well curated.. And, you can get very up close and personal with the pieces.. both in and out doors! It is set on up on a hill, so there are exquisite views from the terraces.. Sensational way to spend a couple of hours!",
          "This was a great place to visit and provided a great view of BCN from the terraces. Keep in mind the Funicular is closed, so if you were planning on doing that as part of your journey to the museum, check first to see if it has reopened.",
          "If you are in the Montjuic area, check out this museum. The pieces are whimsical and well organized. You can plan to spend about 1.5 hours here to walk through all of the exhibit.",
          "Loved that it\u2019s close to a beautiful park so the trip was worth it, there was another thing to do in the area. I was able to see it all despite making it there close to their closing time. Staff was very friendly and gave me good tips to manage the time left with the",
          "The building is a modern design housing items inside and out.not a massive fan of this type of art but I did appreciate it a lot and some pieces were excellent,cafe and shop were lovely",
          "Beautiful surroundings and location, overlooking Barcelona with great views. The art is displayed inside and on the premises outside. Joan Mir\u00f2 and his colours: so joyful! It was well worth the visit.",
          "A very nicely put together exhibition of Miro\u2019s work. You can love it or hate it. I loved most of it. We went up there with the bus and enjoyed watching some nice parks on the way up. Wonderful views over Barcelona from the museum.",
          "The collection of works is very impressive and the building itself is wonderfully calming, light and airy. A great environment to enjoy world class art. I\u2019d recommend avoiding going on a weekend if possible, it was a little too busy when I visited on a Saturday morning.",
          "If you are a fan of Joan Mir\u00f2 this is a must-visit for you. If you never heard of Mir\u00f3 this is even more a must-visit for you! Why? Because the Foundation offers you a complete outlook to his work, artistic ideology and thoughts... and because you should not miss to get to know",
          "Inside the par montjuic and occupying a modern and beautiful building, one will find some of the genius masterpieces, along with temporary expositions and some of the artist\u2019s biography. Some open spaces with Mir\u00f3 nice sculptures. Wonderful!",
          "This was probably my favorite museum during my visit to Barcelona (out of many outstanding museums). Miro was in many ways an anti-artist in his art. Be sure to watch the videos on Miro to learn about his thoughts on art, life et al. There was also an excellent exhibit of",
          "Every time I am in BCN I re-visit this wonderful site. Miro's art inspires and is put on perfect view in this modernist building.",

          "I was feeling overwhelmed by the ornateness and seriousness of the Gotic Quarter, Sagrada de Famila, and Gaudi. A visit to the Joan Miro museum on Montjuic was just what I needed. Firstly, Montjuic is a wooded setting with beautiful views to the city below and to the sea. The",
          "I've spent there about 4 hours. The collection is really impressive. Plus a beautiful park around. And don't miss the views from the roof ;)",
          "If you like Miro, or abstract art and installation, this is a Must. I visited several museums of Piccasso art including in Madrid and South of France, So i decided to visit this one instead of Picasso museum. I saw many Miro arts in the past but here is absolutely different,",
          "It\u2019s a sweet little place on a sweet hillside. Miro fans will keep it busy....as for me, I am not a huge fan of Miro, but was pleasantly surprised by seeing works I hadn\u2019t known of before \u2014 as they are not his most famous works and yet I found them to be My favorites. So, try",
          "a museum that should not be missed.if you have a barcelona pass or a city bus ticket you have a discount that you can use to buy the ticket. a very well organized museum",
          "Great art, lovely spaces, very good cafe. The works are arranged intelligently, allowing an exploration of the development of Miro's many perspectives.",
          "The museum is in a beautiful building The art is complex but well discussed in the audio guide. And it\u2019s all in a lovely location on historic Montjuic. Well worth the visit.",
          "This Gallery is well worth visiting. It was surprising to see how talented Joan Miro was as a 14 year old boy. Many many rooms of his art. Lovely outside terrace.",
          "Of course Miro fans will love it here, there is quite a large collection of his works and also works by other artists. The building itself is also interesting. We are so-so fans of his and still enjoyed it, but if you do not like this kind of abstract art then I would not bother",
          "There are a few must-sees in Barcelona, and the Fundacio Joan Miro on Montjuic is one of them. for me, it's not just about the artwork, but like the Guggenheim Bilbao, it's also about the architecture and the setting. Not only is the building impressive, showing off the",
          "The Miro building is lovely. Set high over the city with dramatic city views and forestry, with the added benefit of being close to the cable car, it is a great day out. Miro is certainly not a favoured artist so we were lucky to see a Lee Miller exhibition (at no extra cost)",
          "Large collection with abstract arts and some really strangely simply paintings like a single tiny blue dot on a big white canvas. Some unusual piece like burnt canvas. The only worthy thing to see in my opinion is the roof top panorama view of the city from the mountain. Picture",
          "If you like Miro's art, this is the place for you. We aren't great fans of his style, so we didn't spend much time here.",
          "Just go there, and use the audio guide. The art, museum environment (inside and outside), are superlative. Highly recommended.",
          "Take a bus to the top and enjoy a stroll around this interesting Mir\u00f3 Foundation. The Mercury Fountain was fascinating. Maybe not to everyone\u2019s taste but fun all the same. Gift shop was reasonably priced and the cafe also had a restaurant side. The view at the back was lovely.",
          "The audio guide was well worth listening to for the permanent Miro exhibit but poor for the temporary one (repeating same text for different pictures). Enjoyed the caf\u00e9 having a place to recharge. Building and terrace views were excellent.",
          "I signed up for the 11am tour in English and have to give it high marks. Incredibly informative, the audio headset that amplifies the guide's voice makes it really easy to hear. Our guide Judith was top notch and her English was very good. I learned so much about Miro and his",
          "Never seen any of Mir\u00f3\u2019s work before. Simply blown away. Beautiful gallery, so well laid out and very informative info. Excellent coffee shop too.",
          "The place is great and the exposition was nice. The temporary parts are ok although not at the same level.",
          "A veritable cross section of the art and works of Joan Miro. A film shows him creating a couple of his more famous pieces. The big plus is the they allow the taking of photos. There were several small groups of school children have tours of the museum. They also have secure free",
          "What can I say. I have visited all the other studios belonging to Miro but this place blew me away especially the 2 floor high textile piece of art which moved me to tears. Spent several hours just walking around and around again. Purchased 2 prints to add to my other art",
          "just so much enjoyed to learn more about Miro his back ground just amazing discovery of a Creative, intuitive man and artist a child of his time to 'reflect that episode' of turmoil, politics, war...and life as such",
          "The Miro Museum is must see for any visit to Barcelona. The favorite art sons in this city are Gaudi, Picasso and Miro. All three contributed heavily to the culture of Barcelona. The Miro Museum is in the Montjuic area of the city--it is high on the scenic overlook of the",
          "You don\u2019t have to love Miro to love this museum. It is simply gorgeous. Don\u2019t miss the \u201c beach\u201d overlooking Barcelona or a bite in the cafe. Small, well set-up and quite a high point for us",
          "Great museum with lots of great works- some monumental. Also architecture of the building is great. A bit difficult to get by public transport. Would highly recommend it if you have any interest in art. I thought it was much better than the Picasso museum if you have time",
          "This is an amazing Museum with a fantastic collection with some of Miro's greatests waorks. A must see for any fan of Miro!",
          "Focusses on Miro's early life and work but revealing and well curated and organised. Lovely building too, from where you can walk to the main art gallery at Montjuic",
          "I really wasn't familiar with Joan Miro's work and I really can't say that I became a fan, but there were some interesting pieces and the location in an area called Montjuic, which is on a hillside looking over the city, is worth visiting for the views.",
          "We took the tour with audio guide. Not all the pieces have information next to them so i would recommand getting the guide. The guide also includes movies and interactive pictures. There is a cafetaria and they have lockers where you can store your luggage. The museum is",
          "The site, the location, the building, the art! Barcelona is a city for art lovers and this museum shows it love for its home boy, Joan Miro. Go, enjoy! The audio guides are terrific -- and best of all, the layout works and it is not too overwhelming. The views are",
          "If you're a fan of Miro, this is a must see when in Barcelona. Situated above the city, (great views btw, wish we had more time to explore the area), the museum has so many great pieces of his work. Wish it wasn't raining and hailing outside today! Because it's a bonus,",
          "A visit to a great museum and a great painter. Interesting to follow the different productions reflekting trends in society from Miro\u2019s perspective. A place to visit when in Barcelona. A nice lunch at the restaurant made the visit even better.",
          "this is not a museum for everyone. however, it has many aspects that make it worthwhile to visit. Miro did not create easy art. his oeuvre was not offensive, but it certainly could be difficult for some. if you are not interested in modern art, then this museum may be",
          "Just a brilliant museum and as good as a trip to a museum gets! Popped in after a walk down from the castle and had a wonderful visit. A beautiful insight into his life and work. Some wonderful works on display in a beautiful gallery museum fabulously well laid out. Really",
          "I love Miro, and he is actually one of my most favorite painters. Whenever I visit Barcelona I go there, and I cannot stop admiring his works. Also go up to the roof and you will see a few wonderful displays",
          "This is interesting, but there is no direction to where to go, the audio guide does not follow the numbers, crowdy, noisy, and overpriced for what it had to show. Paintings and other oeuvres from Miro are wonderful, but shame on the audio visit with the guide:(",
          "Early and late work exhibited, not so much the middle years. Enough to get the flavor. Audioguide tries to explain what the abstract shapes are meant to be - you may or may not buy it. If you love 20th century abstract art, it's great, but even if you don't, it's worth seeing",
          "This is a very attractive building with Miro exhibits and you do not have to be an appreciator of his art to enjoy the visit. Great city views in a peaceful location with rooftop exhibits",
          "My partner has a Miro and it was a must to visit the museum. It is full of his work. A tip is to take the Metro to Paral-lel and then the Funicular to the top and the museum is a short walk.",
          "I love Miro! What a painter/philosopher. Great museum with wonderful views over the city. We walked up the hill to find the museum. Quite the climb. There are other ways up though, so don\u2019t be held back.",
          "If you like modern art this is a cannot miss. Since Miro is my favorite artist I was awed by some of the art works there. The view from the patio of the museum looking out to Montjuic was breathtaking and visitors can sit in lounges outside looking over this view. Would not miss",
          "I really like contemporary museums and Joan Miro museum is definitely a gem! The house itself is so amazing - a masterpiece on its own! And the set up of Joan Miro works is well thought through and really enjoyable! So the combination of the house and artworks - marvellous!",
          "We found it a lovely visit, beautiful laid out and relaxing. We probably did not appreciate his art (which at times left us a little dumbfounded) to thoroughly appreciate it. I think you have to be a real fan to thoroughly enjoy it.",
          "One of the most beautiful museum we ever visited. Location, museum architecture, exhibits, multi-media guide, all together made this visit an exceptional event. All elements combined provide a great overview of Miro's work as well as his contemporaries. Highly recommended.",
          "I'm somewhat galleried out these days so it takes something special to turn me on. We spend over two hours at this spacious and airy gallery leaving with a feeling of great lightness. Miro's work from start to finish is displayed \u2013 his ceramics and tapestries are my",
          "This museum has more art by Miro than anywhere else in the world. It was very interesting to watch Miro's progression as an artist. The art is very contemporary and if you don't like modern art, you won't really enjoy it. There were several paintings that I'm still scratching my",
          "My friend Barbara and I went to this museum early in the day. If you're 65 or older you can ask for a senior discount (worth about 3 euros). Museums can be overwhelming. There's a lot to see and take in. This museum, besides having great, thought-provoking and funny pieces,",
          "Nicely laid out museum on a hill overlooking Barcelona. This contains a good collection of Miro paintings, sculptures and tapestries. Be sure to allow time to sit in one of the sunlounges on the deck overlooking Barcelona enjoying views all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. A",
          "This museum is so outstanding it\u2019s surprising that more visitors don\u2019t end up here. A fantastic display of not just paintings but also sculptures in a building that looks like Miro himself designed it. With rooftop sculptures offering fabulous views. Not to be missed",
          "If you're a fan of Miro, you will love this museum. I am not, however, so I didn't. The friends with whom I was travelling seemed to like it. It is very well-lit and nicely laid out.",
          "Dedicated in 1975, this museum focuses on the paintings and sculptures of Spanish Srrealist Joan Miro ( who spent much of his artistic life in France). It's stunning including its dazzling white building. But importantly it also features special exhibits of world renowned",

          "This museum is dedicated to Miro's work, and although the museum/setting are lovely and I had a personal guide explaining the works, Miro is not a artist I care for. However, I did like his mercury filled fountain.",
          "The Miro Fundacion is a wonderful look into the life and work of Joan Miro. His \"anti art\" in response to the consumerist trends of his day gives an opportunity to ponder the role of art in society. Admittedly some of the works are too\"anti\" for my taste but you can't help but",
          "This is a large collection of Miro's works. Inspirational art and building. Well worth seeing. Get the audio tour. Allow at least an hour and a half.",
          "Had a little difficulty finding the museum in the park, but thankfully we drove and found parking directly in front! Museum has a wonderful collection and the disappointment of some closed rooms was made up for by the view outside of the city below.",
          "It's worth purchasing the English guide tour. Not all placards are in English. Great collection. The gardens are worth visiting as well. Great place to see parakeets.",
          "Loved this place. Even my toddler liked the art, it\u2019s so colorful and abstract. Great statue pieces, super interesting art. Decent cafe and gift shop.",

          "The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 is uphill so be prepared to take a few steps but totally worth it, a fantastic collection of Joan Mir\u00f3. My advice: buy the articket Barcelona, 32 euros and you can access 6 museums in one year time.",
          "How can anybody who puts a blob of blue paint on an otherwise six foot long blank canvas, or paints a line across three canvasses, as though the plaster had cracked, be thought of as a world famous artist? The Emperor needs new clothes.",
          "We visited this museum today which is in the park. The architecture of the building matches the painting/sculpture style of Miro. The art is beautifully set and the garden and views are magnificent. Wonderful treat/respite in the city.",
          "One of the great museums to see while in Barcelona. I had a \"museum passport\" that had entrance to about 8 museums.",
          "This is a must for Miro lovers. The artwork selection will amaze you. It's great to see the different paintings and sculptures and admire the styles of such a prolific artist. We loved the city views! I suggest buying tickets online before going.",
          "Took the funicular up the hill. Part of Metro system. Not much of a view (mostly underground) but an unusual ride. Walked back down to town. Museum just fine. Shows the wide variety of the artist's work. (Learned in Catalan you say initial J's!) Mercury fountain a revelation...",

          "Loved all of this but especially the mercury fountain. Great views of the city as well and a fabulous little bar.",
          "We were lucky enough to be walking when we encountered the Mrio Fundacio. We love Miro and loved this place. It is small but special, if you like the artist. This is the perfect milieux to see some off the beat and track pieces.",
          "Among all the many world-class museums in Barcelona, the Miro Foundation is a standout. It was designed by Miro himself and traces his development through multiple periods and forms. Yes, you can see more famous Miros at other museums, just as you can see more famous Picassos",

          "Lets start with the building. Superb in every way and ultra clean. Designed magnificently to diplay paintings and artworks and it does it perfectly. The temperature wonderful (On a hot day) and the lighting brilliant. Then of course the art work. I thought it was quite wonderful",

          "This place was a blast. After having gone to the Picasso Museum the day before, this was certainly a breath of fresh air. The exhibits weren't simply a retrospective on his life, but instead sought to give some insight into the pieces. The commentary was clearly written by a",
          "I was hesitant to go to this museum due to limited time in Barcelona and it being slightly out of the way, but am so glad that I did. I've long loved Miro's work but it was amazing to see it live-- huge paintings, tapestries, beautiful sculptures, etc and great modern artwork",

          "Situated on the Montjuic mountain, this museum provides a great retrospective of Miao's work, and given he designed the building is a pretty immersive experience. The view of Barcelona downtown from the patio's was incredible. It was expensive though, and audio guides were an",
          "A relaxed and very modern building encapsulates the work of Joan Miro. It is well worth paying the extra to access the temporary exhibitions. You can spend a good few hours here, so wear comfortable shoes The cafe is reasonably priced and well stocked.",
          "The collection is not big but the infrastructure of the museum is very welcoming. Staff is friendly too",
          "I really enjoyed the visit in the museum The museum sits on mount of the Jews and overlooks a beautiful view of Barcelona Apart from Juan Miro's exhibition there are two other successful exhibitions. One of them is by a Japanese artist called Ito Shinsui - a very beautiful,",
          "A well laid out museum with a vast range of Miro\u2019s art showing his progression as an artist and the unique style he brought to canvas and sculpture. The audio guide is excellent and provides detailed commentary on a number of the pieces. Worth a visit.",
          "Beautifully designed museum, high above Barcelona, so the views are gorgeous. I'm not a big modern art fan, but did love some of his work. However, the temporary exhibit, Scars by Kader Attia blew me away.",
          "If you like Miro, this is a must see. It's a great collection in a very nice building on Montjuic. Great to see his works in his home town.",
          "Compared to Picasso Museum, it is smaller and way less work of Miro. It took me only about 2 hours and half of the museum was filled with other artis work. But I would sugguest to go around montjuic to the view point! So its definetly worth to spend about a afternoon.",
          "This is a great museum with a wonderful and comprehensive collection of Joan Miro's work. The audioguide is very insightful in explaining the artist's creative philosophy. After the tour enjoy the cafe and garden's.",
          "The museum is situated in a park on a hillside with a very nice view overlooking the city. The building is itself interesting from an architectural point of view. If one loves Mir\u00f3s paintings, the museum is a must. The best way to reach the museum is by cable car.",
          "The museum hosts a great number of works of art by Miro and offers a lot of information on the artist and his life.One must be a fan of the artist to fully enjoy the visit.For me, it was interesting but not exciting.The shop and the cafe are really good.",

I believe the cultural experience is obviously more important",

          "We were disappointed by this small museum. The art work is not his best. The audio guide was fantastic showing influences and related paintings. The special exhibit on Japanese wood block printing was outstanding.",

          "The setting for the Miro Museum is as lovely as the paintings. At the top of Montjuic in Barcelona you can view the extraordinary work of Joan Miro in both natural and man made settings. Abstract art in nature.",
          "This is an easy place to get to without a car. It's in a lovely park area, so other things to see and do there. This museum is almost entirely devoted to Joan Miro an amazing artist that used many, many different mediums. He is both serious and whimsical and not afraid to use",
          "We took the funicular up the hill and arrived before the museum opened so waited impatiently to get in. So wonderful to be surrounded by the works of Miro, many of which I had seen in books but to see the originals was exciting for me. His work has a child-like quality but also",
          "The simplicity of the almost childlike art is a contrast to most of European art. A refreshing approach to bold colors and shapes. The museum is easy to reach a bit off the regular tourist area in a building designed by Miro\u2019s colleague. Much tableware in the gift shop.",
          "This museum was such a pleasure and contrast to the work of Gaudi. I step into the clean, imagination of a genius. Not crowded and the views of Barcelona are amazing!",
          "I really liked this museum. The art is nice and there\u2019s a nice gift shop. Employees can be a bit rude.",
          "This is a wonderful location in the city, high up over the city, with views and in the park. I gained a better appreciation of Miro\u2019s work over his life and found the museum itself to be very accessible and easy to navigate. Be sure to visit the rooftop for more sculpture and",
          "Situated on the hill in Park Montjuic it is a very pleasant location - entrance fees included in Barcelona Card. Wonderful airy, purpose built museum delivering a great insight inthe work and life of Joan Miro. Very nice experience! Strongly recommend it.",
          "I was travelling with my husband and two teenage boys. We are not big art buffs, but after the Prado and many museum visits in Italy a few years ago, we thought it would be great to see something different. Miro delivered. I don't know that we fully appreciated it, but the",
          "This is an excellent collection of art by Catalan artist Joan Miro. Equally important, every museum employee we encountered was kind, pleasant and helpful. This is in sharp contrast to the very rude staff members we experienced at the Picasso Museum. The Miro Foundation also",
          "It took us some time to find this museum, but it was time well-spent. Miro's work is attractively displayed, both indoors and out, with good explanations in Spanish, Catalan, and English. The museum store had a good range of merchandise.",
          "This museum is definitely worth the trip. Amazing architecture, beautiful art and a view of Barcelona that is not to be beat.",
          "Located in Montjuic, this museum is dedicated to the works of Juan Miro, a modern painter and sculpturer. The museum is not very big, and it takes about an hour to see everything there.When we visited the museum, they had a special exhibition about bees, (included in the",
          "This museum is representative of the entire range of Miro\u2019s artistic output. If you like his work, or modern art generally, I recommend making the time to visit, even for a first trip to Barcelona. It is much more worthwhile than the Picasso Museum, which is repetitive. Best",
          "We used the Articket Pass, which allows us to visit 3 museums at whatever time we want. I enjoy modern art and have liked the few works of Mir\u00f3 I had come across in the past. I found one tapestry and a few works with burned canvas interesting. But I was underwhelmed by the",
          "Situated on mont Juice, it is a nice museum to visit. beautiful art good t do with the audio guide. Nice view on Barcelona. Good to travel to by bus, Metro, funiculair or even by car.",
          "Great collection in fascinating building. A definite highlight of trip. Plan on spending a few hours there. Close to botanical gardens which are lovely to visit.",
          "The permanent exhibition is nicely arranged so you really can see how the artist went through different phases during his career. Highlights for me were the large \"wall carpets\", the sobreteixim, impressive in their threedimensionalness. But of course there are so many great",
          "You won't find a better way to experience the range of artwork produced over Joan Miro's career. A wonderfully curated showplace for the work of a great artist.",
          "I recommend the audio guide. It gave me a great insight into Mir\u00f3- made me realise how superficial my knowledge was of the artist. Some great early works, tapestries and sculptures. Great building too. So glad I made the trip.",
          "This is THE museum to go for Miro and his art. The museum itself is a beautiful building that displays Miro's masterpieces in painting and sculpture. It covers the entire range of Miro's development as an artist.",
          "The museum is located on Montjuic. It's worth the visit if you like Joan Miro's work, have the art ticket passport and are checking out the parks in this area. Some people may not care for his work though. (Think 5 year old's painting of lines and shapes.)",
          "The building is beautiful, set in an incredible location, with a great view of Barcelona. However, regarding the art, we unfortunately don't appreciate this kind of 'art', but it could be appealing to others. There is a more interesting exposition of bees.",
          "Amazing collection of Miro's life work and the variety of 2 and 3 dimensional pieces makes you realise what talent he had. Quite under-exposed in comparison to Dali but well worth the trip!",
          "Just excellent - if you're a Miro aficionado - that's the place to go, but it's also a great place to get introduction to his art and techniques",
          "Located in Parc de Montjuic is the Joan Miro Exhibition. Do not miss it. also the sightseeign from the Parc is very nice.",
          "Although I had been to Barcelona a few times, I never made my way to this museum. WHAT A MISTAKE! It was absolutely wonderful and I spent a few hours here. The museum itself is absolutely striking and the collection with traveling exhibitions top notch. DON'T MISS!",
          "We bought the musuem pass to skip the line at Picasso (the pass is worth it) so got in free to this musuem. Really fun - not modern art fans but really had fun with some of his crazy statues and color combos and paintings. Wish we had brought the kids to see another example of",
          "If you love modern art and Miro, you will enjoy this museum. Buy tickets online, go before lunch and enjoy!",
          "Joan Miro creates art that I have not yet figured out how to appreciate. As I gaze upon a large white canvas with a solid blue dot off to the right side, or a large white canvas with a black line snaking from left to right I just don't get it - how is that art? I read most of",
          "Worth a taxi ride for this half day and add the nearby \"Anthropological Nacional\". Buy the Barcelona museum combo ticket",
          "A beautiful building located in Montjuic, filled with glorious Miro art. If you have time for only one art collection during your stay, then this must be it, rather than the disappointing Picasso",
          "This gallery is absolutely gorgeous - it's stunning to see all the huge and beautiful pieces that Miro made and are hanging on the walls. Make sure to include the audio headphones when you visit, as you will learn a lot about his work. In addition, the space is beautiful, and",
          "Essencial to know the painter. Beautifull connection between the Art and the Architecture that houses it.",
          "If you like Miro you will be enchanted with this museum. Galleries in and gardens outside have an extensive collection of his art",
          "This is a very large gallery in a really great setting. The site is on top of a hill overlooking Barcelona, with fabulous views and surrounded by gardens and next to a funicular cable car up to the castle. The gallery itself is huge and provides an excellent viewing point for",
          "Seeing all the Miro works in one space allows one to form a deep connection with the artist as well as learn about his process and the era - I loved it!",
          "The exposition is well presented: has extensive explanations, a good range of both paintings and sculptures. The building itself is also interesting and fitting the content.",
          "One of my favorite museums in the world. Every time I come back to Barcelona e need to go there and see every corner! All the place around the Fundacio is wonderful too!",
          "I used my Barcelona Card for free entry to this museum. I did pay 5 Euros for the use of an audioguide. Miro\u2019s art didn\u2019t appeal to me but the museum was spacious and well laid-out. Signs on the displays were also in English. There is a restaurant and a gift shop on site. I",
          "This is by far the best museum in Barcelona. It\u2019s a different place, well organized and far away from the tourist tradicional atractions. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "An interesting exhibition documenting the life & works of Joan Miro. Well presented in a spacious setting.",
          "It is a bit off the beaten path but well worth to visit - perhaps combined with a trip across the harbour with the cable cars. Many interesting pictures and sculptures by Miro.",
          "I like modern art and some things were interesting, but my family just did not get a lot of the art. Very abstract. Great collection of Japanese wood block paintings on second floor. The bee exhibit was very engaging as well.",
          "This attractive museum houses a decent collection of Miro's work, and has other special exhibitions, too. Miro confuses a lot of people, but it's fun to decipher the thoughts in the paintings.",
          "Beautiful building and grounds! The art was kind of meh, but that is just Joan Miro. It wasn't very busy and that was nice, especially since it was a Saturday.",
          "Even if I'm not an art fan, my girlfriend and her friend wanted to come here. The place is very calm and organized. Impressive, as one of the largest museums in the world. I remember the guide said that there were more than 200 paintings and 100 sculptures. Anyway, I think the",
          "Fundacio Joan Miro is located in Parc de Montjuic and can be reached via the funicular railway from Paral-lel metro. It's about 5-10 minutes' walk from the Parc de Montjuic station. Admission was free with my Barcelona card (normal admission is \u20ac12). There's a large array of",
          "Not for everyone this one, but set up by far seeing Joan before this death and design by Sert a lovely clean lined modernistic building in itself. A little out of the city, sat up on Monjuic hill a beautiful park setting and walk area. Some of the best of Miro work in well",
          "Ordered the tickets online. Beautiful collection of Mir\u00f3\u2019s work. Wonderful modern art museum. Recommended.",
          "We were on a tight schedule and the only day to visit for us was Sunday when the Foundation closes at 3PM. We only had an hour, which was not enough, you need at least two hours because the museum is big and there is a lot of information you can read. Also, there is a great roof",
          "This is an excellent museum devoted to a single artist. There are a wide variety of first rate pieces highlighting the various periods, styles and media of Miro. Highly recommended for serious art lovers and Miro afficinadoes.",
          "Awesome museum. Great building and layout, massive collection of artworks. I went early in the morning so I did not have to queue. Recommended!",
          "Miro captures nature, and the surroundings tocreate an oasis in the middle of the park. he was very private, and understated, as is reflectd in his museum",
          "WE visited both to see Mir\u00f3's fantastic work and to have lunch in the peaceful and very pleasant courtyard. In addition, there is an excellent gift shop where we were able to buy most of the presents we needed to take home.",
          "I decided to visit Barcelona because I wanted to visit Fundaci\u00f2 Mir\u00f2. High expectations, but it didn't disappoint. There were 22 rooms dedicated to the artist's work over the years, including paintings, drawings, tapestries and sculptures. Felt totally immersed in his world...",
          "Great museum with paintings and sculptures of Joan Miro. The museum shops are quite good and the caf\u00e9 is fine. Don\u00b4t forget to have a look outside.",
          "Worth the visit, you can see special works and the building is very interesting, locate in a beautiful environment.",
          "Bit hard to review fairly, as art is very personal. I normally find much inspiration and plenty to muse over, however despite high hopes I honestly didn't find much that I liked. The Mercury fountain was beautiful, albeit not by Miro. Other than a couple of sculptures and the",
          "I'm not super fan of this type of art, so why my negative review. Mir\u00f2 is a famous name for barcelona. You just need to like and appreciate his art (Surrealism) otherwise you'll get bored like I did.",
          "If you like Art and Mir\u00f3 you should come here for a visit. Lovely location with easy bus access, staff is super friendly and helpful. You can leave your bags in lockets if your back is already killing you, like mine was :D",
          "In addition to the Miro collection, the building itself is quite amazing. Worth spending a half of a day there.",
          "I went to study the architecture of the building, by the time i spend much time inside the museum. Especially the garden is peaceful. Ps:take some time off to the terrace.",
          "We enjoyed the place though there are not that many Miro's works exposed actually; I enjoy his work but am not an 'all-Miro fan', so I found it OK and not more. Very positive point from a more down-to-earth perspective - the cafeteria offers very reasonably priced drinks and",
          "You won't see Miro's iconic or most famous works here... those are all at other museums. I guess if you're a real Miro lover you'll like this museum, but we breezed on through and felt underwhelmed.",
          "A fabulous collection of the artist's works and a place where a guided tour is most useful to understand the artist's career and pieces. Make sure to see the mercury filled fountain and the roof top sculptures (with a great view of Barcelona).",
          "Such an amazing collection, make sure to take the guided tour! Who knew that Miro did more than paint and sculpt? Weaving? Just WOW!!!",
          "If you are a fan of Miro then you will want to visit this museum. All the exhibits are explained and well documented and the place has a nice cafeteria on the premises.We decided to visit it on the hop on-off bus circuit, since it is not walking distance to the downtown area",
          "great museum of modrn art on the hills surrounding Barcelona, with dynamite views of the city. Hundreds of valuable paintings by Miro, and videos of how he made the abstract art as an old man. Great carvings and monuments outside in the palacial gardens. this great museum offers",
          "The largest single collection of works by Miro, one of the many great artists to live in Barcelona, if you like his work then make your way up Montjuic you will not be disappointed",
          "A low profile establishment located in a beautiful area ideal for walking around for hours. The collection is impressive and beautifully displayed. I particularly liked the explanatory notes helping you navigate through Miro\u2019s artistic life. If you have enough time, you can",
          "Visiting the Park of Montjiuc, it is one of the highlites of this area. The white building, with not imposing architecture and good organisation of the exhibition is usually full of authentic art lowers. Very interesting collection.",
          "Miro suggests that we \"look for the noise hidden in the silence, the movement in immobility, life in the inanimate things, the infinite in the finite, forms in a void and myself in anonymity.\" Miro reminds us that Barcelona has some kind of creative alchemy that enabled a",
          "It was wonderful finding more out about Miro and his influences. The museum is very well laid out and easy to get to by subway. Not to be missed.",
          "The space is perfectly organised having been designed specifically for Miro's paintings and sculptures. Located on Montjuic mountain and accessible by Funicular (Paralell) and bus services, it makes a relaxing and stimulating contrast to queueing outside the Picasso museum.",
          "We spent an hour and a half visiting the Funacio Joan Miro. This gallery has many fine works of the artists, in multiple mediums. Who knew that Miro worked in cloth and with weavers? Here one could see the various stages of Miro's development as an artist, not just the one or",
          "This is my favourite museum in Barcelona. The building is very modern and displays the art very well. If you like modern art then you have to see Miro's work. There is a good cafe and a library if you want to take a rest. It is on a hill so you get a good view of Barcelona",
          "On Parc de Montjuic is located the Fundacio of Joan Miro; if you like modern art, you will find famous collections of his works, from the artist very appreciated.",
          "If you're in the area, it's worth a pop in to see Joan Miro's work. It won't take very long and the museum is set up very nicely, easy to navigate.",
          "Slipped the line with our Barcelona Card and proceeded into the gallery before the horses arrived. Lovely setout gallery and friendly staff",
          "Not being a complete fan of Joan Miro, it is a good discovery that helps understand the artist\u2019s background and the insights behind his art. Museum is in a very nice setting and worth the visit",
          "Of the museums and galleries we have visited in Spain the Fundacio Joan Miro is by far the best curated. Each group of works (gallery room) has a multi-lingual general explanation and each individual work is named and dated. Unlike many of the galleries we have visited , the",
          "Please try to take the bus when you visit, the climb is to the museum is long. Beautiful once you arrive.",
          "The Juan Miro foundation was created by Miro as a way promoting modern art. The initial collection was from Miro's private collection. Plan to spend at least 3 hours here. The location on Montjuic offers scenic views of Barcelona. There is close proximity to other museums such",
          "This artist is a wonderful human being. Would say that this museum equals and complements the museum in Palma de Mallorca. Lots of his colourful work, less of his darker period. Absolutely fantastic!",
          "Barcelona is also famous as Miro's birthplace. The museum is exceptional and the art shown in the permanent collection is interesting for the walk. Also the museum that is located at the top of Montjuic can reward you with a great view so it is worth visiting for many different",
          "Take the mountain railway from the Paral.lel metro station to the upper station and walk up the Avinguda (Avenue) de Miramar for 5 minutes (300 m) and you will find the Mir\u00f3 Museum (Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3) on the right. The entrance fee is / EUR for persons older than 65. I enjoy",
          "Really lovely building and selection of art work. The views from outside are lovely. I went on a school trip so didn\u2019t get much time to look for myself.",
          "We were on the Hop on and Off Bus and one of the stops was the Miro Museum. You will not be disappointed. The exhibit of Joan Miro as well as other up and coming artists is quite profound. The audio tour is a must as well. There is a wonderful restaurant in the Museum, as well",
          "Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 is a purpose-built museum to house works by Joan Mir\u00f3, 1893-1983. The Mediterranean rationalist building, 1975, designed by Jose Luis Sert is a masterpiece of 20th Century architecture. Its playful, dramatic shapes provide a stunning background for a",
          "The art was interesting. Learning about the artist/founder/financier (Joan Miro funded the museum with his own money) was equally interesting. However, with all there is to do in Barcelona, I would not make this a top site to visit. If you're there for more than a few days and",
          "There is some quite good art here, but most of it is fairly abstract and I had the distinct impression Miro, though talented, was somewhat ambivalent to selling his art so did some fairly odd things to his paintings, particularly in his latter years. We had the audio guide, but",
          "If you like modern art, this is a must-see. It is full of paintings, sculptures, and lot's about Miro's life for you to enjoy. Very good exhibition space and well laid-out.",
          "Joan Miro experienced major tragedies of the 20-th century (civil war, world wars, 40 years of fascism in Spain). He managed to create thought-provoking art through his long life and the museum offers a splended opportunity to learn more about him and his art. Make use of this",
          "a very good display, with good explanations and different examples of his art. nice restaurant. lockers to put bags",
          "If you wander Las Ramblas you will see Joan Miao's artwork on the sidewalk. See much more of him at this museum created especially for this local artist. As with the Picasso Museum, it is interesting to see the transitions in his artwork from the beginning stages while he is",
          "This place has a great collection of Miao's works in a casual setting where you can browse and appreciate in an unrushed way. Came towards the end of the day and it wasn't crowded at all. A bit of a hill to get here though, so would recommend coupling this with the MNAC.",
          "Absolutely outstanding! The collection is so well displayed and organized by Miro\u2019s development as an artist. We walked around twice. Sat at their patio cafe enjoyed a glass of wine and went around for the second time, this time focusing on the pieces that captivated us by the",
          "Joan Miro has been my favorite artist for years so I knew this was a must do. It didn't disappoint. I feel like I learnt a lot and saw a lot but also left with a thirst to learn more about him. We arrived on Wednesday.08.November at 1pm and were told the museum might close at 3",
          "As we were travelling Europe, we decided to stop in Spain, especially Barcelona. We visited the museum of Miro and has hundreds of works, and a selection of works by other artists, many of which are works either given to or dedicated to Miro. Some of Miro's early work is (at",
          "This site has a nice collection of Miro's work, but the best is elsewhere, as with most museums dedicated to a particular artist. It's a very nice facility in a great location, worth a visit.",
          "A must-see if you like Miro. Not only is the building and the view of Barcelona breathtaking, but the collection is beautifully curated! The library also has a fantastic collection of books!",
          "We only got to see the gift shop and cafe as the museum was closed due to strike action from the staff. From what we could gather, the staff are being undercut financially by a company that supplies part-time staff. The strike was not well organized and made no real sense it",
          "Unfortunately the workers are all sitting outside and are on strike and the museum is closed:( Thankfully it wasn't too far out of the way since we took the hop on hop off",
          "Turns out that Catalonia is home to three incredible modern artists - Picasso, Dali and Miro, as well as the architect Gaudi. We visited the Picasso museum as well and this was our preference. The walk up is lovely - though steep - through a lovely park. The building itself is",
          "Great museum dedicated to Jean Miro and his work. Many examples of his work. Great view of Barcelona out the back of the museum. If you like Miro, be sure and go here.",
          "I first learned of Joan Miro from Dave Brubeck's Time Further Out which had a work of MIro's on the cover. Not that much of his work is in museums in North America. This museum in Barcelona provides an excellent opportunity to gain a clearer sense of is origin, development, and",
          "I always enjoyed Miro's work and was blown-away but the span of his work which is seen at this museum. I loved it and developed a much larger appreciation for Miro.",
          "We came across this place on a list of things to see from Atlas Obscura, specifically for the mercury fountain. its unfortunately behind glass and looks like its not fully operational, but was still a very interesting installation. The rest of the museum was ok but, overall, I",
          "Totally enjoyed it . Make sure to allocate a few hours of your time to admire his popular artist's work.",
          "Good exhibition in a calm, spacious building. Well worth a look, and in an interesting neighbourhood to visit.",
          "We didn\u2019t book ahead but had no trouble getting in. Great displays showing Miro\u2019s artistic journey. Great restaurant!",
          "This is a unique museum, as all periods of his life and work are displayed in a unique building. It is located at the top of Mont Juic accessible by cable car.",
          "Comprehensive excellent gallery with interesting guest exhibitions in a beautiful location. (Good shop too.)",
          "A longtime fan of the Spanish Artist whose work is far less celebrated than the likes of Dali or Picasso it was on the first day in Barcelona that a visit was paid to Fundacio Joan Miro, the sizable museum providing a retrospective look at the Artist's life and many phases",
          "+ nice building and architecture + very good collection and well presented + audio guides are excellent - entrance prices are quite expensive",
          "My wife went and spent ten minutes in the gallery ,I decline to visit and sat in the tea room as I feel his art ,is not art but the,scribbling of an old man who has conned folk in to believing he is a master !",
          "Miro is the great & signature artist of Spain. This gallery has great collection of his work. To walk around the gallery with experienced guide is recommended because you can really know his work in deeper understanding (at least know the meanings of symbols). The gift shop has",
          "Joan Miro left us an art as simple as combining the primary colours to awake emotions. simple drawings, strong colour statements; sculptures, huge canvas, there is all here. A privilege position on the edge of the Montjuic mountain, from where you can glance down to the coast",
          "If you love modern art and architecture, don't miss this museum in Barcelona. The interplay of the works on view with the interior and exterior spaces is wonderful, and provide much insight into the life of this unique artist. We very much enjoyed our visit.",
          "Worth the trip to one of the finest museums in Barcelona. His artistry is breathtaking and his legacy is assured.",
          "The statue with the man's appendage at the door stopped us from going in. You have to really be into \"modern art\" and we just wanted more history. If it's your thing go!",
          "With the audio guides, a much deeper understanding of Miro's work in a calm and tranquil setting. Take a picnic to sit in the park afterwards and ride the cable car. A splendid day out!",
          "This is a great museum that you can spend an hour in or several hours, depending on your time restrictions and your interest. We spent more time than we thought here because the museum is very well thought out, very spacious and airy, and Miro happens to be a fascinating artist.",
          "The building and the art work well together with beautiful views and interesting commentary. The only negatives were the churlish attitudes of the cafe and shop staff which were almost comedic in their sulky insolence. Overall well worth a visit.",
          "Joan Miro's art is not for everyone. But if you do enjoy it, then this is the best gallery to see it. Numerous pieces of his are on display. As said, if you enjoy this type of artwork then this is the best collection of his work in the world.",
          "I was a fan since, long time ago, I read about Miro in my French class. It was surreal to be able to visit some his works.",
          "Nice museum, but it works best if you are a Miro fan. You'll learn a lot about his life and art. But if this is not your taste, you may not enjoy this very nice museum.",
          "Lots of fun and a nice view from the top. Worth doing even if you're not an art aficionado (in my opinion). I bought the Barcelona articket which gives you entry to this and 5 other museums. I recommend making a day of it- starting at the top of the hill with Montjuic castle,",
          "Funny, some of the more famous paitings were not on display, but the museum has lots of his work and it is a pleasant building.",
          "Easy to get to - its a stop on the Hop on Hop Off Bus (red route) - on Montjuic. Spacious, light and airy building with an impressive Miro collection. The rooftop is interesting, with a few sculptures and a view of Barcelona. The cafe offered reasonably prices sandwiches and",
          "Our favorite pieces were the sculptures on the patio. Be sure to check out the Mercury Fountain -- it's hypnotic!",
          "It goes without saying that your enjoyment of this museum will depend on your opinion of the work of Miro. For me, having explored the museum I felt largely unengaged by the work on display. I loved his use of colour but it didn't connect with me on an emotional level. Having",
          "4 of us visited here yesterday afternoon and all of us came out shaking our heads. This is the first gallery I have visited and not seen one piece of art I would like to own. The best I could say is that some of the paintings were colourful while some were ugly and others (to my",

          "I did not know much about Joan Miro before visiting this well laid out wonderfully curated museum. I left with a passion for his work and life. Because the museum was created during his lifetime, Miro had a major hand in the curating and the flow of the work. Extensive",
          "Miro is one of my favorite artists. And having read about him-I just had to visit his museum. A short hike from El Born where I stayed-I loved the scenery en route. Montjuic. El Poble Sec. Miro's connection to his land; his interest in Zen spirituality; compression of space",

          "When in Barcelona try to get to visit this gallery, it is well worth it. To get there Use the Metro from Parallel, then use the funicular line up to Montjuic, it saves a lot of up hill climbing this way, then it is a 10 min walk to the museum from the funicular drop off point.",

This very lovely mediteranean gallery is set amidst several parks",

          "I visited with my family which includes teenagers and we regretted it. It is well laid out with great audioguides (5 euro extra). We were not able to understand the abstract art. One of the exhibits consists of a canvas painted white with a very small, fuzzy blue dot on one",
          "There is something about Mir\u00f3's art that is very appealing to kids and a visit to Mir\u00f3's museum is a child-friendly experience to start with. The playful architecture only adds to it. The temporary exhibits bring yet other dimension to the extensive collection and we totally",

          "As a bias fan of Miro for years, I had high expectations of this museum. It did not disappoint! Whether you know anything or nothing of Miro, this is an exhibition worth visiting. We arrived via the On & Off Bus by accident and I'm so glad we did. The bus gave a discount on",
          "This museum really highlights the life and art of Joan Mir\u00f3. As the visit takes you up on Montju\u00efc it's well worth reserving the day for the museum and the Olympic stadium and the vistas. The funicular gets you up and the best way to get down again is by cable car and see the",

          "I have always loved Miro's work, so time spent here was what i chose to do on my birthday. Miro's work is so often playful and seemingly happy, but he lived through the Spanish Civil War and in a Europe torn by WWII. His early goal was to annihalate art, but his art carried",

          "Impressive museum, which really gives the observer a good glance into the life and work of this great artist.",
          "To be honest, my take on Miro prior to this visit was of a somewhat second tier artist who catered to a commercial market. Having visited this excellent museum, I take it all back. The museum, which is a lovely bit of architecture, provided an expansive survey of Miro's",
          "There were lots of children there, you know why? Because it looked like a child painted that stuff. If you're into it, go. They also have AC and WIFI. That's what kept me there so long. Literally saw a picture of a dot.",
          "If you like Miro and this period in art, it's a fantastic museum not to be missed. The audio tour was good, but we thought it wasn't well designed for the museum. It seemed more lecture tour than museum tour - it could have used some editing.",
          "The main purpose of our visit was that our teenager would get to know Miro, but he learned more than that, also quite a bit of history. We took the \"funicular\" from Metro station Parallel to go to Montjuic, the museum is only a very short walk from the station.",
          "Museum located inthe ar5c at the top of the Hill. Nice to walkaround the gardens before going to the Museum. Very modern, clean museum with lots of interesting Miro drawings and Paintings and informatin about the artist. Not crowded",
          "This is a beautiful museum. It is on a little hill and overlooks the city of Barcelona. The entrance fee is not too steep and there is a lot to see. Some of Miro's most popular works are there, which was memorable to see for the first time. I loved the mixture of textiles,",
          "Holly and I took and enjoyed the self directed tour of this museum. I am very pleased to have been able to convert from one who did not appreciate Miro to one who does. I look forward to learning more about him",
          "I have long been a Miro fan but I did not have a full picture of his career until my hour long visit here today. The museum gives a full picture of Miro's development as an artist starting as a boy in Tarragon Catalunya. It shows the influences of Japanese art, Picasso and even",
          "We loved our visit to the Miro museum. Our girls (age 7 & 8) loved the whimsical artwork. The museum is very open-feeling. While there is a lot of artwork, it's not so big that it's overwhelming. I loved watching my kids sketching the artwork in their journals. A must see.",
          "This museum focuses purely on the incredible art of Joan Miro. The large collection follows his work chronologically and is wonderfully curated. There are not many galleries that dedicate their displays purely to one artist and this place reflects the love of his countrymen to",
          "This is a well laid-out collection of Miro artwork in an architecturally interesting building. It is a bit of a climb to get there but worth it. The collection shows the range of mediums he worked with, and the consistency of his work. If you don't \"get\" Miro, you wills till",
          "Lovely building and definitely worth a trip. There are many large works here that are unlike the Miro found in other major museums. Labels give insight into his very intellectual approach to his art.",
          "Let me say from the outset, I am not a Miro fan. But visiting Barcelona, to me, would not be complete without a visit to the museum of one of the best known Catalan artists. The museum is located on Montjuic, which was originally a Jewish cemetery, and now a large hill park. I",
          "Tucked away in Monjuic's mountain sorrounded by its greenery lays this very modern museum by international and Catalan artist Joan Miro. A very contemporary building where most of his very well known work is displayed to the public. A wide range of his paintings sculptures",
          "We ended up walking to this museum from our hotel - which was well worth the 40 minutes! The free museum tour in English was great (I think only on Thursdays) although we also did the audioguide since we arrived before the tour. Although there was a little bit of repeat, in",
          "If you want to learn and understand Miro visit his foundation. Get the earphones to listen to his life. Really interesting!",
          "If you are into Joan Miro, then a visit to this building is well worth it. It chronicles how Miro came to be such an avant garde artist, but shows where he came from as well, and how he came to be the artist he was. The building itself is stark and modern, to compliment Miao's",
          "Pretty easy review - if you know and love Miro, you will love this museum. If you don't know Miro, you will enjoy the visit, because you will learn of the artist, who was very unique. If you are not a fan of his work, don't visit,",
          "Rarely do you get a chance to see every style and period of an artist's work. The gallery was well curated with abundant explanations in English too. We loved it!",
          "Not only does the museum provide an extensive collection on Mir but it provides the social/cultural/political context from which Miro's works were created. A lovely setting in the gardens and on a hill in Barcelona, the museum offers a respite from the city.",
          "I'm a big fan of his work, so I found this place to be fascinating. I feel like the venue matches his style so well and it was a more fun, relaxed atmosphere compared to many other museums. I will say, one of the highlights was the cafe as well. The food was very decent for the",
          "This is the most beautiful setting for Moto's work. The organization was based on his dear friends collaboration. Each room suited the size, type and period of Miro's work. We were thoroughly impressed as art connoisseurs. Miriam my wife is a docent at the San Francisco Museum",
          "See his work in the flesh!! If you like twentieth century art, this is a must see. Miro's 2 to 5 meter-sized works need to be experienced up close. We spent four hours here. Much child-like exuberance.",
          "If you are even vaguely interested in Miro, go. This is a wonderful museum containing a comprehensive exhibit of his work with many paintings that are not well known. It is very well displayed and the museum itself is in a light, airy building. A good bookstore and a small",
          "We have arrived at 14:30. There was a queue in front of it and we wanted to buy a ticket. After a minute or two a quite agitated lady from the museum approached the queue and told us that we can't go in: it is Sunday and museum closes at 15:00. We were prepared to leave the",

          "If in Barcelona, and you value Miro, do visit the Miro foundation, it is an excellent art experience",
          "We found this museum has an nice collection of Juan Miro modern art in a bright, clean setting. A nice stop in Barcelona but not on par with great museums like the Lourve or Rijksmuseum.",
          "We took the cable car to Mont juice and walked up a couple of streets to the Fundaci\u00f3n, on your right. There were no lines, not at all crowded, and peaceful. One does not go to see Miro if one does not love and enjoy his particular style of art. After a pleasant hour of",

          "Beautiful site right by a park and immediately by the city tour bus stop. This is a very informative, beautiful, modern museum with indoors and outdoors spaces. At least 2hours and a half if not half a day should be allocated to such a collection. There is a restaurant and a",
          "I'm not a particularly big fan of Miro before or after this museum. BUT... I thought it was an important piece of our art tour of Barcelona... the Dali in Figueres and the Picasso in Barcelona... as all three were contemporaries yet separate art entities. We took the Metro to",
          "THis is a gem of a museum and for any art lover a must see. Most of the paintings were donated by his wife and friends after the artists death and they are housed in a beautiful well attended setting. There are large scale pieces and early work that you won't see elsewhere.",
          "The Fundacio Joan Miro is a wonderful setting for a truly world class art collection. It's refreshing to see such a comprehensive collection of an artist's life's works in one place. Miro's stylistic progression and the integrity of his vision are beautifully displayed, as he",

          "The Fundacio Joan Miro not only provides insight to one of the most important artists of the 20th century, with all his whimsy, there are great views of the city from the rooftop sculpture gallery. The gift shop has unique items, clever and inexpensive. A great stop on the hop",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this museum, set on a hillside overlooking the city. It contains an immense collection of Miro's works, showing his evolution as an artist, and also his social and political views. The work is displayed magnificently. We also enjoyed lunch in a beautiful",

          "Oh my God. It was AMAZING. Outstanding. Breathtaking. The museum is huge and it is easy to realize Mir\u00f3 participated in the overall design, which does not happen very often with museums. I know that the fact that he is my favorite plastic \u2026",
          "If you like Miro, you'll love this museum. The building itself provides nice views to both interior and exterior",
          "If only get to see one place when visiting Barcelona, this has to be it. Classiest museum you\u2019ll ever go to in Europe if not the world. Unique works with great crowd control.  The restaurant was reasonable and superb.  Was very relaxing, a vacation from our hectic, jam packed \u201cvacation\u201d.",
          "Beautiful exhibitions and a great layout that makes it easy to see everything. The sculptures on the roof are cool too because you can admire them and the wonderful view at the same time.",
          "A wonderful museum, from a space point of view and for how it lets the visitor discover Joan Miro in deep. The  temporal exhibitions can be really good.",
          "Great art museum for the whole family.  It hosts a wide variety of modern art in different media, not just by Miro.  The traveling exhibit was interesting in an academic sense (I dont really like experimental music).  The kids loved the \u2026",
          "Miro Museum. Personally I am not a Miro fan so I didn't go into paid part of Museum. The gift shop and part that you can visit for free is nice.",
          "It was closed at 14.00 so best in mind you have to come here at 10am",
          "The foundation boast of having thousands of artworks, sculptures, drawings and show soooooo little. \nSuch a small exhibition left me dissapointed! Yard and outside objects was locked. Pathetic Espai 13. Inquire if its all open by call \u2026",
          "Beautifully presented pieces of art work. Extremely good value especially on national holidays. Sat in the courtyard and drank a  large and thirst quenching  beer in brilliant sunshine surrounded by thought provoking art work that inspires you to  create some artwork of your own.  What could be better?",
          "Surreal experience. Much love, much obliged \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udda4\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Very nice museum on top of the hill, the surroundings offer a very nice point of view and the museum is comparatively cheap to other Barcelona's attractions",
          "Such a beautiful and enjoyable contemporary art museum. The location is great with views of the city, and the building itself has great indoor and outdoor areas to view the art and sculptures. Joan Miro collection is extensive with many pieces of different times.",
          "Inspiring and liberating to see his work. As an artistic person it is great to see that one doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to produce great works of art. Miro was really ahead of his time. The gallery is definitely worth the visit. Montjuic is also gorgeous.",
          "Exciting museum!\nIt it my first time to meet Joan Miro. I enjoyed having a good lesson of his art works. Most of his works are daring and surprising.\n\nTip: must take a guided tour or at least A set of headphones in order to understand his \u2026",
          "How could you possibly get enough Joan Miro? Go here.\nI don't think this shows up on most tours. There is a bus stop here and we used the excellent mass transit in Barcelona.",
          "Great selection of Miro's work if you're a fan.",
          "Unforgettable experience, especially early morning before arrival of hordes.",
          "Very inspiring place. Unusual, sometimes confusing but interesting works of arts. Not only for Joan Miro's fans but also for any kind of art enthusiasts.",
          "Pleasant way to escape the hubbub of the city. Interesting and thought-provoking works of art. Great location looking over the city, with a well-stocked and reasonably priced cafe and a terrace to relax in.",
          "Not many Miro's works\nBut the view is the best \nAnd Calder's work is great",
          "Mir\u00f3 is an artist that manages to stir the feelings of the most jaded of museum visitors. The art exhibited at the Foundation follows the artist's path from his beginnings to his demise. There's something in the exhibit for everyone, but \u2026",
          "I spent whole afternoon here and I absolutely love it. Miro has been the pride for people from Barcelona. His cute and abstract illustration has inspired many people. I am so happy that I have fulfilled my dream by coming this foundation.",
          "I'm not a true art lover and i guess this place is more suited for those who are.we were looking  for something to do after coming down from the cable car that was near by.  The facilty is great, the display was arranged very well and it \u2026",
          "Beautiful location, beautiful building, beautiful pieces. The whole experience felt lush and smartly curated. Staff were friendly, cafe fare quite tasty. Very worth it, could have happily spent hours here.",
          "Great space amazing collection if you like contemporary art don't miss this place in Barcelona",
          "The art was good and the temporary exhibit was really good. Get the audio guide for sure.any of the halls have special music composed for it and was my favorite experience of the museum.",
          "I didn't like the artist much but what I liked the most is the toys and drawings that alm visitors are allowed to play with and let your creativity speak up !",
          "Nice museum in an excellent location.  A must if you are a Miro fan and educational for those with only a limited knowlege of his work.  Tip, buy the annual pass for one euro extra",
          "This is extremely amazing collection of Joan Mir\u00f3 art!!! For everyone who loves his art and all others \ud83d\ude09",
          "Great collection of one of the most influential abstractionists. Wide variety of art pieces to dive you into this exceptional mind's head.",
          "Solid museum! Definitely worth a visit when you are at Montj\u00fcic. Cool architecture and collection.",
          "Ticket prices can be found quite steep at around 35 euro's per person. A lot of Asian tourists seem to fancy it here.",
          "Finally went to this museum and I really enjoyed it. If you like abstract art, you will love Juan Mir\u00f3's work and this museum. What made me even happier is that we can take pictures and videos of pretty much everything. The staff was very \u2026",
          "Make time to see this, Barcelona has wonderful musiums and this is one of them.",
          "Small, you can easily do it in an hour. The most famous work is the fountain made of mercury by Calder who was a friend of Mir\u00f3 and also has a sculpture outside. Close to the gardens, walk down after your visit.",
          "The museum is nice - but very hidden \ud83d\ude01",
          "excellent !!! quiet place with good vibes and beautiful view .",
          "One of the greatest Museums devoted to a single I have had the pleasure of visiting. Walk up from the town centre and enjoy the premises.",
          "excellent atmosphere, beautiful building, 50 Miro pieces, cool for kids",
          "The caf\u00e9 had the best doughnut I've ever tasted. Art was good too.",
          "It isn't often that abstract art move me emotionally, but the context, the architecture and the art did so here. And it had the bonus of way less tourists than most of Barcelona's other museums, plus a cafe with affordable wine and food. Can't recommend it enough.",
          "The exhibition itself isn\u2019t that outstanding, but the location and the building itself were extraordinary!",
          "You don't know how to explain these works, less than 50% of the chance that it makes you feeling \"that make sense\", the rest is that \"I really know nothing about modern art...\", But they are nice color combination and looks interesting even \u2026",
          "Amazing place and art! We had no queue, it wasn\u2019t too busy, go in straight without a ticket! Not too expensive and so worth it!",
          "Amazing museum. The best thing I did in Barcelona. Good value and kids go for free.",
          "Built during the life of the artist himself, this white building, filled with natural light through high windows hosts some of Mir\u00f2's best masterpieces. Paintings are paired with smaller and very large sculptures, inside and outside (in \u2026",
          "Wonderful museum. Not much else to say other than add it to your list of places to visit when in Barcalona.\nI accessed it via the tour bus. Also a lovely park next door that's worth a visit",
          "The Cafeteria responsible had an unacceptable attitude against my son. First he sent a waitress to tell him he is not allowed to eat a sandwich not coming from their canteen. My son abode by the rule and put it back in his bag. Then this \u2026",
          "A great museum interesting as much for the works of art as the interesting architecture and design choices of the building itself. The audio-guide is strongly recommended as it is hard to really appreciate the works without knowing the story behind.",
          "One of my favorite mus\u00e9um in bcn. Nice collection",
          "A few of Miro's sculptures outside. Very expensive entrance fee. Did not go in. There are some nice contemporary sculptures in the garden on the side.",
          "Free with Barcelona card. Must visit for art lovers. Coffee is 2 euros and decent. View is spectacular.",
          "Don\u2019t really know what they do, but sounds like they do very important job)))",
          "Very nice museum, well organised and with interactive activities.\nAfter visiting it, at some moments I had the impression the artist repeated himself at some moments, and some pictures are rather simple. However, it is worth visiting the museum.",
          "I really only went to see the mercury fountain, which was mesmerizingly beautiful. But the rest of the place was pretty abstract and there wasn't really much to read",
          "Awesome facility of the work of Juan Miro. Don\u2019t go down to the basement and begin playing with the inflatable pool toys like I did. That turned out to be an exhibit lol.",
          "A museum designed to showcase the work on Joan Miro. Places to sit and contemplate the messages in the works of this great artist. The views from the lookouts are stunning. Don't miss Calder's Mercury fountain\n Joan Miro had a distinctive and unique Catalan voice. Llarga vida a Catalunya!",
          "Fantastic experience at the Fundacio Joan Miro. I recommend the audioguide that is complete and allows an in-depth knowledge of the artist's works",
          "Beautiful museum with lots of artwork in barcelona, a must stop on a tour of barcelona. A nice walk to get to and breathtaking views of the city on top of the hill.",
          "A stuff is very kind and helpful which made the experience amazing :)",
          "Miros paintings are great! Great collection",
          "Very nice exposition. Building is also really nice. A must see place.",
          "Outstanding collection of miro art in a beautiful spot",
          "Nice visit, interesting museum. Free entrance on first Sunday of the month, 10-15 h.",
          "You can feel the Milo\u2019s philosophy from his art",
          "Beautiful simplicity of gallery design and perfect display of Miro's work",
          "One of my favorite places on the planet",
          "Great museum for the Miro fans. There is a lot of art and information.",
          "Nice museum, with a nice permanent collection a quality temporary exhibitions. The location is beautiful and almost worth to go just for the view from the terrace on top. If you are local or intend to go more than one time they have a anual pass for 14 euros",
          "A beautiful place to learn about Miro's life and vision.",
          "Although I liked the overall feel of this museum more 15 years ago, I couldn't help falling in love with Miro all over again this summer. Everyone who loves art should get acquainted with this iconic artist.\nIt's easy to take a bus to the museum from many locations in Barcelona.",
          "You really get a lot for your 12\u20ac admission (7\u20ac for students). 22 rooms, most of which exhibit exclusively Miro works. There are a few more rooms that also feature pieces of some very iconic artists - Lee Miller, Max Ernst, Man Ray - almost \u2026",
          "5 hours going very slow, it was worth every second of it",
          "It was my second time visiting and it was good as usual. If you like Joan Miro, it's a must see.",
          "It\u2019s simply a great place to spend > half day. Loved it.",
          "Great art to view with informative audio guide without being overwhelming",
          "V\u011bry nice building and, the art Is perfect",
          "Amazing. I had no idea Miro was a weaver. Outstanding views of the city.",
          "Inspiring works in a beautiful space with great views.",
          "Lovely building, beautiful artwork, great views and good cafe.",
          "Worth going. Great selection of art in an interesting building - spacious and cool and nice terraces.",
          "Amazing museum with lots of beautiful art from Miro.",
          "what a place! a lil\u2018 microcosmos that perfectly accompanies the great artwork - 7\u20ac for students also truly managable! Not only for Mir\u00f3 fans !",
          "A superb collection of Miro's work, in a great location overlooking the city, you can spend several hours wandering nearby",
          "Museum beautifully displays many works by Joan Mir\u00f3. By far my favorite part was the colorful descriptions of the works. Who knew that you could write several paragraphs about the meaning of a blue spot on canvas?",
          "I loved that museum. Everyone knows Picasso but Mir\u00f3 should be famous as well. The building itself is also interesting. The enormous tapestry is amazing, you just sit in front of it and don't understand how.",
          "A journey thru the evolution of Joan Miro the artist. Superb gallery and many fine examples of his work.",
          "\u20ac13 per person wasn't a bad price to see the permanent collection and the temporary exhibitions here. I personally find abstract art very difficult to enjoy, so I wasn't the biggest fan of Miro's work, but I still found a few pieces to \u2026",
          "Wonderful works of thought provoking art.",
          "Nice views of Barcelona and comprehensive collection",
          "New to the art gallery world but I definitely enjoyed my visit to the foundation. And the bit that I enjoyed the most was the part of the building that oversees Parts of Barcelona.",
          "Enjoyed touring the gallery and outdoor spaces.",
          "Great location with amazing views and very inspiring Artwork by Mir\u00f3.",
          "A lot to see, worth a visit and also different artists I definitely recommend!",
          "Lovely gallery, generously donated to. Good collection of Miro's work. The early work was particularly striking in its difference from his more famous paintings. Beautiful location with spectacular views of Barcelona as well. A must visit.",
          "Must see for modern art lovers. Understood the narrative of Miro at last! Great explanations both on signs and in audioguide.",
          "Amazing and beautiful exhibition of Miro's work. However the audioguide (5 euros!) is not worth it, it doesn't have enough info on the pictures and it had a painting that wasn't in the exhibit... oh and there was no access to the terrace and the patios :(",
          "Outstanding art ,well presented.",
          "Wonderful museum that represents everything a Joan Mir\u00f3 wishes to see. Located at the beginning of  'Parc de Montjuic', in Barcelona, it is a great entrance to the mixture between art and nature. Has a small restaurant.",
          "Worth to see. Take te way through the gardens!",
          "Lovely oasis of calm. Miro's art is full of charm and humour. Caf\u00e9 staff were super grumpy. Great views of the city.",
          "Good collections, however the ticket is a little pricey.",
          "Great museum featuring a somewhat lesser known artist. The building is a also a piece of art in itself",
          "Amazing space dedicated to the genius of Miro! Be prepared to smile \ud83d\ude00",
          "This place truly humbles the mind.",
          "Not my style of art. Fabulous building with good quality shop, book store as me cafe.",
          "Very scilent  place to enjoy painting and monumental arts.",
          "Love this place!",
          "The building in space for the Joan Miro collection is very interesting.  Miro apparently designed to the space himself and donated many works of art to it.   Other family and friends and collectors of Miro have donated or lent art to this \u2026",
          "Incredible museum. Rooms have well detailed introduction and most of the works have a paragraph explanation.",
          "Breathtaking. The sculptural grey white  building is a work of art in itself. It creates vistas on the exhibits as you are steered round them in an unfolding pathway. At one point you are presented with a stunning view over the plane on \u2026",
          "Great to see so much of Mir\u00f3's work. I recommend a guided your if, like me, you find it difficult to understand the meaning behind his work.",
          "Not much only a little bit that I found interesting",
          "It is a nice museum and if you like Mir\u00f3 I would recommend it but I have to say that you shouldn\u2019t eat there the restaurant/cafe isn\u2019t that good but I like it as a museum. I would say that it is a must if you are in Barcelona.",
          "If you like modern art, the Miro Foundation is a must-visit. A rotating collection of Miro's work, in a specially-designed modern building that shows it off beautifully.",
          "It's one of the most beautiful buildings for a museum it has a view right above of the city of Barcelona. The museum itself is all an exceptional representation of Mir\u00f3",
          "Great museum. Can't wait for everyone to visit",
          "Awesome light filled space and inspiring collection",
          "A must see for Mir\u00f2 lovers. Wonderful overview of his work. Nice views.",
          "Highly recommended for modern art lovers. And a very nice place as well.",
          "What a beautiful museum, art gallery, building. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d been to Barcelona so many times and never visited it. Do yourself a favour and go. I took the audio guide for \u20ac5 more and it was totally worth it.",
          "I didn\u2019t know a lot about Mir\u00f3 before this visit, but I have to say that this museum has made me fall in love with his work. His beliefs and reasons for his art are throughly explained and make understanding this artist a little bit easier. The view of Barcelona is a nice bonus! \nFree with Barcelona Card!",
          "If you like a white canvas with 1 squiggly line across it and another with just 1 dot of color it's fir you.",
          "Incredible museum dedicated to the Catalan artist Joan Mir\u00f3. I recommend getting there quite early, as queues start forming around 10:30-11. Discount for students, teachers... There are quite a lot of workd under exhibition, plus temporary \u2026",
          "Nice small museum. You need 1-1.5 hour to see all exhibition. There is kids corner in the basement.",
          "A great location for a great museum",
          "Nice calm space. Beautiful views from the terrace. Cafe on site. You can definitely spend more time here than you expected. We did anyway.",
          "I love going here. I took my mom she was visiting and she was in love with this museum.",
          "Great artworks, good audioguide, nice setting. Well worth a visit.",
          "I loved the sound exhibits",
          "Very nice place to spend an afternoon enjoying Mir\u00f3's art. Not specially big, but nicely distributed and not a crowded place. Mir\u00f3 foundation lays on top of a hill by Park Montjuic, on the border of Barcelona with L'Hospitalet. I recommend \u2026",
          "Excellent exposition of Miro's work, beautiful building in one of Barcelona's most picturesque districts. Highly recommended!",
          "If you like Miro you'll like this museum",
          "Nothing special.\nIt has some good paintings bur generally I think that the exhibition is a bit poor.",
          "Loved this museum - light and airy building and decent amount of art to keep you busy but not too much that you can\u2019t see it all. Amazing outdoor spaces with lots of sculpture.  Easy to get to by bus and lots to see in the area too.",
          "Learned a lot here about Miro. Excellent and beautiful museum.",
          "Great place to visit!",
          "If you like art then this is a good place to see it.",
          "I'm not a fan of Miro that that doesn't mean the exhibition was not greatly laid out. MACBA could learn a thing or two from this place",
          "Wonderful place!  Must visit.",
          "Really fascinating. Miro is a little bit strange for all NORMAL people. But very very intensive modern reducing elements and more. Must be seen if you are in Barcelona",
          "Cool place but not essencial to your journey",
          "It's ok..  restaurant is lovely",
          "Offers a wide variety of artistic pieces, as well as temporal exhibitions. Beware: Miro\u2019s paintings are surrealist, which means many people don\u2019t like them/understand them. Entrance  is very affordable.",
          "A wonderful experience at a reasonable price. You can tell the exhibitions have been laid out with thought and there's plenty of space to look and take your time at each of the pieces. The cafe is reasonably priced also and the views across the city are amazing",
          "What can I say. I think I find him more interesting than Picasso.",
          "More for the art lovers. Seems a very famous painter. Nice gallery with good collection",
          "Wonderful Miro exhibition! Very positively surprised!",
          "Excellent audio guide and beautiful surroundings. Well worth a visit",
          "Beautiful well organized museum. Not my style of art tho'.",
          "Nothing exciting for an average person/tourist. Too small museum for 13\u20ac entrance. I suggest to visit other places and leave this museum last...",
          "A great museum showing art from one of the most important artists of the last century.",
          "Great building. Temporary exhibitions can be quite nice but spread over 3 floors can make it an issue following.",
          "Its a great museum but there's a lot of trash tourism that can't behave in a museum. What's worse, the staff are on their phone and don't tell anyone to keep quiet.",
          "Great place to see miro in all his phases.",
          "Amazing! Very little someone can say about the Miro foundation to describe it! We were very happy with our choise to get the audioguide. Make sure you have enough time-we went Sunday and we would like a couple of hours more!",
          "It is free on Saturdays! Awesome place with loads of Miro artwork.",
          "Interesting how artists justify their work... I like Joan Miro but some of the descriptions of why he's painted what he's painted make me LOL.....",
          "Very interesting, requires time to enjoy the wealth of art",
          "The building is brilliant, the view from the building over the city is amazing. But the art isn't unless you really like Miro. If you don't then go see Pablo's stuff, way better. If you want to see even better art go to MACBA, especially whilst Jaume Plasne is on, that is 5 star",
          "It feels a little tacky  to review this place based on my opinion of the namesake art. I'd never been particularly drawn to Miro but I *hoped* this collection would inspire me. It didn't. I love many modern artists but not this one.",
          "The foundation Miro is a must see in Barcelona.",
          "Beautiful building. Great paintings. Very difficult to find places inside the museum. Staff very arrogant with the exception of a man in the book shop. He was the only nice one. The staff seems to be bored.",
          "Pretty good museum if you like his work (which you probably do it you're looking this review up?). I'm not the biggest fan so my favorite thing here was the Alexander Calder Mercury fountain, haha.",
          "Not for everyone. There are many unconventional paintings like a dot of ink, or one line of a brush. I guess that for someone with a background in art it will mean something, but its definitely not for every person.",
          "I had so much fun! Great space, great art, great artist!",
          "Great experience.",
          "This rating is for the museum, not for Mir\u00f3's artworks, which are great, superb even.\n\nWhen presenting an artist's work, you always want to organize it chronologically to show the artist's progression over the years. If you choose not to, \u2026",
          "Go there if you are really really into modern art . I was bored there though .",
          "Magnificent exhibition in and incredibly location. An unforgettable experience.  For all ages, kids were crazy with the paintings. Don't miss it.",
          "Not my favorite artist but the space is great and the Mercury fountain was worth it. Mori did remind me of my childhood and the innocence that art can poses.",
          "Very nice museum, well organized with different type of art from Mir\u00f3, including tapestry, sculptures, painting....very easy to visit thanks to the well designed space. \nThe coffee place is worst trying at the end of the visit to relax with simple but good sandwiches, pastries, coffees, beers.....",
          "My second time at the Fundaci\u00f2, really worth a visit and spending a few hours in! Mir\u00f2 supervised the building of the place himself, so it was built to house his works! I do recommend getting an audio guide, though.",
          "Most of the stuff was uninterpretable and provided no sense of humanity",
          "Excellent setting to view many of Miro's masterpieces and see his changing style over time.",
          "If you are a lover of Miro's art, this is the place.",
          "Not the most beautiful building at the first sight, but I grew to appreciate it. I couldn't get inside, but the sculptures in the garden are fun, and the park behind the museum, leading you down the the Greek theater, is just lovely.",
          "I loved this museum. It is in a very beautiful place. Not only the Mir\u00f3's art is great but also the views of the city. There are very good temporary expositions that are worth coming back to the same museum even when you already visited it.",
          "Good for art Lovers",
          "Wonderful gallery with wide selection of Joan Miro painting and sculpture. Great views from the terraces across Barcelona",
          "Gorgeous architecture, lovely art and nice bistro - caf\u00e9. I\u00b4ve really enjoyed the visit.",
          "Really cool museums.",
          "A beautiful collection of paintings and sculptures by Miro. The museum is spacious and located on a high spot with great view over Barcelona. The audioguide is useful.",
          "Great collection from the artist.",
          "Toplocation and great museum - I for myself had to realise that I got something about Miro wrong, so that I was a little bit disappointed, but thats my problem. Generally a lot of pictures, sculptures and installations about this great \u2026",
          "A great Museum   with very interesting Miro's permanent collection and also temporary exhibitions. Nice bar with terrace.",
          "This is a small Mir\u00f3 collection but the temporary exhibits are worth the trip, and the temporary Japanese woodblock exhibit of It\u014d Shinsui was quite impressive. The exhibit featured many portraits but also a few landscape prints. A video \u2026",
          "Wonderful place to visit even for those not familiar or interested in the arts. The space and how three work offs exhibited throughout it really captures the spirit of the work without a great need for explanation or education.",
          "It was not all fun and games for Miro as you see from the works in this museum. Well lit and spacious with a broad array of his work, some deeply moving and some infuriating- this is a must see for anyone interested in visual arts. These \u2026",
          "It's a must go part of Barcelona, combining it with a walk to Sants-Monts Juic. It demands a dedication of two hours and extra time in the Huan Miro boutique with a great variety of products.",
          "The garden at the back of the foundation has an amazing view of the city.",
          "This was such a treat. I would recommend this beautiful museum to everyone.",
          "An amazing setting for interesting art by Joan Mir\u00f3. I\u2019m still flabbergasted by the Calder mercury fountain. Look for the dots that diffuse and the temp exhibits.  The sculptures on the roof are fascinating",
          "Worth a trip. Just make sure you actually like Mir\u00f3. I connected more with special excibitions and gifts.",
          "A decent overview of Miro's work on the lovely Montjuic",
          "Joan Mir\u00f3 was ahead of his time. With huge paintings and fabrics besides unique lines or even a circle in a giant uqadro, barcelona deserves to have this great artist.\n\nThe only point of the tour is the price of admission $ 24.00 but without this it is very worth knowing the history in art of the great painter.",
          "Great art, cheerful and happy",
          "Wonderful art, definitely worth a visit.",
          "The architecture of the museum is what I liked the most! Otherwise it's a little pricey (12\u20ac for the whole thing) but you do get to see a lot of Miro's work! I did enjoy the visit, wasn't wowed by the temporary exhibitions though.",
          "Awesome building with a lot of Miro\u2019s works",
          "Whenever I visit Barcelona, I come by this amazing museum of Joan Miro. Some people do not know about him but he was/is one of the most important artists. \n\nThis museum is located in the middle of the path to Montjuic Castle, near the Museu \u2026",
          "Skip the Picasso museum for this. Picasso is cool, but the collection there is small. This however, has all any Mir\u00f3 fan could dream of",
          "Everything you want to know about joan miro is here in the museum. \nThe building is made for his work. Don't miss the sculpture garden at the roof. ^_^",
          "Nice silent place good meal",
          "Amazing buiding. Exposed paintings and sculptures are really amazing.",
          "It's interesting, but not my type of art.",
          "Amazing place where there is a lot to see ! Good structure to spend easily a mid day ! Permanent exhibition, temporary ones, I enjoyed my time spent there and appreciated the whole\nContent.",
          "Great exhibition of Joan Mir\u00f3 art throughout his life amd how it evolved to the style most people know him for. The place is open, welcoming and full of light.",
          "Really good place for some good Modern art.  Would go back!",
          "This is a great place for inspiration! It's a hidden gem in Barcelona.",
          "Wonderful museum. Great museum store, tough a bit expensive",
          "Incredible collection of work by Mir\u00f2 spanning across all mediums and forms. Came the day before the new exhibition opened but still enjoyed my time fully. Try to come here on a nice weather day \u2014 the terrace is gorgeous!",
          "This is an awesome place well worth visiting. Beautifully presented with several works on display in each room. You won't be disappointed.",
          "Very nice museum. Obviously not the one showing the most famous Mir\u00f3 pieces of art but still enjoyable. Guided tour possible in different languages. Located in the area of Montjuic",
          "Love art not sure how much of this is my idea of art though",
          "Dont like his art.",
          "Highly recommend it, me and my friends spent hours there, favorite museum in the city, 7 euros if you are a student as myself.",
          "One of the places to go to see this interesting facet of Miro's life. At the entrance and gardens you have a few interesting sculptures by Miro. Quite a few lesser known works in the gallery itself. Make sure to go up to Son Boter, which is supposedly the studio where he painted before he died.",
          "A very nice experience",
          "OMG is this place amazing. There's so much more to Miro than most people would think, going here puts it on display. Nicely curated, well laid-out. And it's in a beautiful park-like area.",
          "Interesting building and location to exhibit the art of Mir\u00f3. Personally I am not a great fan of his art but I think it\u2019s worth a visit. For great shame the audio guide is not available in Portuguese.\nTicket and audio guide cost is 17 \u2026",
          "Very interesting place. I knew nothing of Miro but found it very interesting even though I did not appreciate his style. Really felt I understood the man by the tine I left. Cafe was really nice and inexpensive",
          "Loved the personage outside. Coffee was great. Shops excellent though expensive.",
          "One of if not the best art galleries I've ever visited. Jaw-dropping. Tour takes about an hour. You must like contemporary, modern or non-representational art. Miro was hugely influential in world art. Forget about needing to understand it, just see if it some part of it provokes emotion.",
          "Very nice building and display. However his work left a lot to be desired. We preferred Picasso",
          "Loved it.  Very comprehensive.    Love seeing exhibits of just one artist so you really get an understanding of the artist.",
          "I think this place is for art pasionate. His style cannot be understand by everybody. For experience is good, but i didn't like it so much.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Love it! Amazing collection of his paintings...\nThe restaurant on site is excellent and the food is delicious!",
          "I enjoyed the visit very much. The audio guide was very helpful in understanding Miro's work and life. Nice views from/in Montjuic  parks, as a bonus.",
          "Unless you are an artist or a Miro fan, DON'T go there! Much more interesting stuff to do in Barcelona",
          "A fairly small well done Miro Museum.  If you're not a Miro fan, might not be worth your time if schedule is tight.  If you like Miro, don't miss.  1/4 day is fine.",
          "Interesting art aside, the building itself is crazy beautiful. We had a lot of fun just taking pictures on the rooftop, which has a great view as well. The caf\u00e9 inside has pretty good food as well.",
          "Building is nice but contents a little difficult to empathise with.",
          "Be careful, they sell biased books about Catalonia. Apart from that, nice place!",
          "Amazing museum with nice shops",
          "Great little museum, amazing view over the city. And the Calder Mercury Fountain is the icing on the cake!",
          "Great architecture.",
          "Such a nice place, amazing architecture, very nice art collection with interesting tapestry from Mir\u00f3. Just be aware that on Saturdays the terrace closes at 14h30, we were there afterwards and left very sad about not being able to check the upstairs part",
          "Great museum, covers the breadth of his work very well. Beautiful!",
          "Wonderful building and exciting artworks",
          "A superb collection of the artist's work in a beautiful building.",
          "Wonderful museum for anyone interested in Joan Miro and contemporary art in general. Really good layout, great little cafe and shop too.",
          "Larger than we expected, great pieces of art. Main exhibition is great collection of all stages and development of Joan Miro art.",
          "Nice museum, you could watch different kind arts of Mir\u00f3 here, it take 3-4 hours to visit, really worth to visit",
          "Great museum! Being able to take photos in most of the spaces was refreshing. There's a huge variety of work on display, so you're very likely to find something here that captures your imagination. Quite a few of the pieces also have a \u2026",
          "Great museum. Also got kids. Mir\u00f3 is great",
          "Nice building. I wouldn't say the same for Miro paintings.  My son could draw better.",
          "Love the collection, been here the second time.  Recommend that you take the time to walk around the space and enjoy the sculptures.  I got a scarve with a pattern of one of Miro's panting, not cheap but it's design based on a real piece of art instead of some expensive brand name :-)",
          "Not worth the Money..",
          "Really outstanding collection of Miro art, in a cultured, quiet and modern setting. Be sure to rent the audio headset \"tour\" as well.",
          "Amazing! Don't miss it if you are in Barcelona!",
          "Nice building. Great gift shop",
          "A well designed place. Kid friendly.",
          "Best laid-out Museum in the world. Great location. Educational.",
          "Beatiful!",
          "Nice gallery, well laid out. The building suits the exhibits and the work displayed is provoking if not slightly strange.",
          "My favorite museum in Barcelona. Plenty of Mir\u00f3's works yet not overwhelming.",
          "Mir\u00f3 is a poet using painting and sculpture to express himself. Very impressive. I will suggest visit with audio guide.",
          "great museum, great architecture, lovely restaurant and great nature around, a must on a rainy day too",
          "One of the more comprehensive exhibits I've been to. Amazing samples of Miro's many mediums, with pieces across al decades of his life.",
          "Always an excellent opportunity to enjoy arts",
          "Nice Museum",
          "Recommended to people that really like and understand art. Not worth it to take kids here",
          "Great enlightening experience. Gives you plenty of room to enjoy artwork from every angle.",
          "A great museum",
          "Mir\u00f3 has been one of my favorites since childhood.  This is a great venue for sharing Mir\u00f3.",
          "Beautiful building built specifically for the art of Joan Miro. It is a bit pitty that the natural light had to be blocked from entering the exposition, but I understand the reason. The art itself is nice, in modern style. I personally liked the Mercury fountain and the tapistery made especially for this place by Miro.",
          "Great display of art.",
          "It's a refreshing museum be it  inside or outside,  after you take your time inside you can go outside to see the sculptures with a beautiful view of Barcelona",
          "Good views from the city and also nice walk through gardens and pintoresc stairs and statues to get there. \nThe museum is mainly contemporary art, including both paintings and statues, with an initial interesting influence from the French paintings, much recommended for a morning.",
          "Wonderful collection of pieces by Miro",
          "Spacious air conditioned gallery with a decent collection of Miro's works. Really enjoyed the visit.",
          "While I was familiar with a few of Miro's pictures, I had no idea he had produced such a phenomenal range of work, including sculpture. Thoroughly enjoyed the gallery, lots of areas and levels in a stylish building. Also lots of learning on \u2026",
          "Nice place with a lot of interesting art. There are many things to do in Barcelona, but if you're interested in art, this place is definitely worth the visit.",
          "Truly amazing museum. If you like abstract art you will love this museum.",
          "Between Picasso and Miro museums, worth the time taken to visit.",
          "Wonderful museum fill of Miro art. This is over if the nicest museum in Barcelona. There is a good view of the city too.",
          "Great art work! Was really cheap and if you fancy a hike walking up the hill isn't bad but you can also take the metro there.",
          "Really stunning and interesting architecture. Hosts a unique balcony with a view over Barcelona",
          "Very bad experience in Christmas time. Closed the 25th and 26th without any advise on website and at the entrance, just a sign with the word  \u201cclosed\u2019",
          "Fondation opened on 10 June 1975, Joao Mir\u00f3 make this building with Joan Prats for the new artists incluing your art.\nLocation in hill called Monjuic Barcelona Spain.\n\nMarcio March is photographer and take pictures work Mir\u00f3 for show what you see when come to this space.",
          "If you love the artist, you'll love the place since you love viewing his works. So it's a matter of interest and a nice experience.",
          "I recommend the English tour. Very good!",
          "Amazing museum. Not 100% sure you can take pictures, but I took a few and wasn't scolded or anything unlike the Picasso museum. My favorite sculpture is the mercury fountain. If you bring a bag, you will have to place it one of the lockers \u2026",
          "Interesting and instructive place",
          "Early and mid paintings, wonderful collection of sculptures. If you've seen Beetlejuice then you will recognize the sculptures. Fantastic!",
          "respect to joan miro and it was so good to visit there, good entrance price, I advise to use bus to reach there (we walked and it was hard)",
          "Extremely glad I got to explore this extraordinary place on my recent trip. Talented artist and visionary",
          "Lovely museum, well curated, lively and spacious. Spent better than an hour enjoying the artwork and then stopped into the adjoining cafe for a drink. Perfect afternoon in BCN.",
          "We went specifically to have a tour given by the museum published to be in Spanish language. When we arrived there was no Spanish option. It was too disorganized to have paid  13 euros.",
          "Awesome place for Joan Miro   fans!",
          "Best collection of Miro anywhere.  Come early.",
          "nicely arranged museum with a wide variety of miro's pieces. some terraces and rooftops make up a good experience. the entrance ia 12 euro (7 for students) and the audioguide is 5 euro extra.",
          "Great place to take students. The best part is  a lovely outdoor park with grass and shade.",
          "Miro paintings are always a treat and seeing so many in one place was magical. The setting is beautiful and easy to reach by bus from placa catalunya. Don't miss it when in Barcelona.",
          "As good as it gets as galleries go. A beautiful setting to get to know Mir\u00f3 and to wish you had got to know him sooner. Wonderful to see the school parties of tiny kids getting to know him from the beginning and we hope there are more like him on the way.",
          "Very nice atmosphere, so impressed with the architecture. Eventhough you're not much into modern art, you can still enjoy this place. The space is fun and inspiring.",
          "Small yet lively.",
          "Great Museum if you like surialism and modern art.\nNot that big though, you'll be done in an hour or so",
          "Joan Mir\u00f3 is one of the greatest artist from Catalonia. This museum honors his work with large and elegant spaces.",
          "If you are interested in modern art and of course in Miro, this is a must",
          "A really good example of a modern art museum. The exhibitions are well presented and organised, and they give even a complete newcomer a great sense of the importance of the artist and the works displayed. I certainly learned a lot about \u2026",
          "Miro was a genius",
          "When you are in Barcelona, don't miss a visit to the Joan Miro museum\nYou can spend hours learning about his art and look at both paintings and sculptures. He uses fantastic and distinctive colours in most of his coloured paintings. Don't \u2026",
          "Some good views of the city from the rooftop buy I have to day I was not inspired by the art (not my sort of thing -but everyone to their own).",
          "The place is wonderful. And the surroundings are perfect for a walk. It is Miro that I have issues with but that's for another review.",
          "The architecture is really nicely done in modernism way. The painting of Miro is of political meanings, but not of aesthetic values.",
          "For normal human beings: be prepared to be challenged on understanding of modern art. Recommend to buy the audio guide, though it some times seems to go a bit over the top in what can be interpreted from drawings on a sheet of paper. \nThe \u2026",
          "Such a crazy artist. I really liked this place and the hike to this place.",
          "Amazing museum, I'll visit every time I'm in Barcelona and never regret making the trek up the mountain.",
          "Great museum, exhibits are well explained",
          "Very friendly staff - beautiful lay out - and lovely outside space and cafe :)",
          "Beautiful. But maybe to many paintings of birds, stars, and women. Maybe that's Miro's fault. Or his strength?",
          "Loved their temporary collection, the mercury fountain and the view of the city. Their permanent collection was also interesting.",
          "An amazing collection of works by this unique creative genius.",
          "Look on Mir\u00f3 pictures online before you come, to see if you connect to surrealism. If not, skip.",
          "Great for lovers of Joan Mir\u00f3\ud83d\udc9b",
          "Great fun. Highly recommend if you are in the city. Building is quite beautiful. Would go again. On site cafe is over-priced.",
          "Very nice  but such a shame they have covered all of the indirect light source designs by the architect Jose Luis Sert. The entire architectural design is based on this.",
          "A great museum that you can do in a few hours. Well worth the trip.",
          "Great collection. The foundation is in an amazing location, a great use of 90 minutes or so.",
          "Fantastic view from terrace. Good overview of Mir\u00f3s work.",
          "Vary nice art gallery, the temporary exhibition also are really good",
          "Must be part of your visit to Barcelona",
          "You get what it advertises. Lots of Miro art work. If he's your kind of thing you'll love it but if you think it's pushing the definition of art a bit far when you see a black line on a white canvas I'd save your money.",
          "Absolutely a treasure! A bit hard to find but so worthwhile.",
          "Limited collection of Miro.",
          "Amazing!",
          "Very nice alternative to more famous artists such as Picasso or Gaudi for example. The museum is open everyday except Monday, Sundays rooftop is closed. There is a cafe and toilets if needed. Don't forget to visit the parce around. The \u2026",
          "Very good place !",
          "They have much more works than the museum in the Palma de Mallorca. The audio guide was helpful to understand Mir\u00f3's philosophy and his style. The caf\u00e9 of the museum and their coffee were also good.",
          "Beatiful displayed collection",
          "Fantastic museum. My favorite thing in Barcelona.",
          "Artwork museum....good if have time",
          "One of my favorite museums and exhibition venues in Barcelona. It's a must visit",
          "Amazing building with modern achitecture inspirated in the mediterranian style. Add the amazing view over Barcelona from the balcony and the Miro collection and you have a must visit place. Get away form the crowdest turist places and relax . Can get there by funicular with the metro ticket.",
          "This was a childhood dream come true. I have always adored the work of Joan Mir\u00f3 & the pieces displayed were beautiful and well-chosen. The visitors were diverse and respectful. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and more! :)",
          "I would recommend getting the excellent audio guide to help you navigate through this musuem.  For the average people, it is a whole new world of abstract art. I find it very difficult to understand or relate to most of the artworks.  It was challenging and provoking. You are not going to see beautiful paintings here.  ",
          "So interesting in both artistic and architectural ways!",
          "you will love it",
          "Amazing museum! The building itself is architecturally speaking interesting, and the art is displayed in a smart way so the museum is easy to get around. You also get breathtaking views of Barcelona. And of course Joan Mir\u00f3's art is wonderful!",
          "As a fan of Miro's artwork I had to go see this and it did not disappoint, beautiful building and the artwork inside is great, a must visit when in Barcelona.",
          "Very simple space, yet really organised. Worth the visit.",
          "Wonderful museum, art pieces are bizarre, thought provoking, colourful, dark, Miro is a great artist and we thank him for donating all this art, we even purchased a beautiful posted at the gift shop",
          "Fantastic collection of Joan Miro's art.  Utterly absorbing.   You will need an excellent coffee in the cafe afterwards!",
          "I guess if you are an art aficionado this is great but for a philistine like myself, meh.",
          "Very good - art descriptors really help to interpret exhibition",
          "Excellent art museum in an architecturally beautiful building!",
          "Fascinating and not too expensive.",
          "What can I say about this place? I went here two times, and I liked it more the second time. I don't know what it means... Maybe that I need some time to get to like Miro's paintings.",
          "Looooots of his works. Can have a seat and feel his moving!!",
          "I really enjoyed this museum with paintings and sculptures of Joan Mir\u00f3. It shows which change this artist went through over his entire life.",
          "Very nice Museum, quite enjoyed it. Friendly staff, lovely facilities and it's fairly easy to get there from the city centre.",
          "I never understood Miro before visiting this lovely museum. I finally understand. He has become one of my favorites. ",
          "If you appreciate Miro, youhave to visit this place .... splendid",
          "Addition to great art enjoy the views over Barcelona",
          "Amazing collection of Joan Miro's artwork.  A true fan's dream. Here you can see his work in painting, sketches, ceramics, sculptures and more.  Amazing collection.",
          "Good exhibition and very complete, missing only one of my favourites, but the space is very good and well organized, and cheap too, there's a bus stop just in front, it's the best way to get there, otherwise a 15 minute walk to the closest metro station.",
          "Very complete museum and nice spot in Barcelona a little away from the city.",
          "If you already know a lot about Miro, you'll have a great time. If not, you'll need the audio guide to put what you're seeing in context. The visual descriptions are sparse and lack detail. \n\nThat aside, the selection of work is very impressive and I learned a lot. Also: don't miss Calder's mercury fountain. ",
          "Loved this place. Highly recommended!",
          "This place is glorious. Miro is beautiful, bold and thought provoking.",
          "Great Art! If you enjoy Art this is a must see. At the end feel free to enjoy a nice coffee at the restaurant inside the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation",
          "This is a museum, as always, which deserves a long and slow visit. All the area has plenty of nice spots.",
          "In this museum you can enjoy the great Miro's artwork. Nice place to visit with children and intruduce them into art painting and sculpture.",
          "Too overpriced for such a small collection",
          "Great museum. Older facility but great collection",
          "Lovely collection and hilltop site.  A great way to take a break from the crowds of the city and relax.",
          "Really nice museum, with meaningful peaces, no takable guides IN English though",
          "Joan Miro was a truly fascinating man - and this museum let's you discover it well. There's explanations of the artist's worldview written in few languages here and there throughout the place; ticket price for people from 15 to 30 years old - 7\u20ac",
          "Moro is one of my favourite artists, but this is always a great experience",
          "I went here with my husband and our two teenage children. This place is a must see for fans of Joan Miro as well as viewers learning about Miro for the first time. The street and pop elements of his art appealed to my teens. And the views of Barcelona from the museum are lovely.",
          "This place offers to you to better understand Joan Mir\u00f3's work. Not only the exhibition but also the building is very interesting. When you get on the roof the view on Barcelona is just perfect. Very nice and english speaking staff. It's wheelchair accessible. ",
          "Fabulous collection in a lovely building. See this and MACBA to lift your soul. And then travel down on the cablecar to Barcelonetta",
          "It is the second time we were there. Although a big museum, it lacks the fascination other museums spread. It is nice, but the museum and the audio tour are not able to captivate me! ",
          "Beautiful collection in a quiet, serene place above Barcelona with very helful and friendly stuff.",
          "Could have been synced with the music",
          "Just beautiful. With a permanent exhibition and a temporary one, on a hill with a stunning view on Barcelona.",
          "Recommended for all tourists who want a lovely view of Barcelona, a great cultural visit or a wonderful lunch at the restaurant of the foundation.",
          "Beautiful museum with an abundance of the artist's work. Great view of the city. Good cafe.",
          "I expected it to be bigger with more paintings by these excellent artist. Anyway, it's very well located on the hill and it deserves a visit. Price is 12 euros for an adult.",
          "Really nice museum. Well worth the visit. You also get to learn a lot about the artists and how he evolved. ",
          "The sculptures were beautiful and so were the paintings. The structure was also beautiful. A great tourist attraction.",
          "Necessita q li rentin la cara a l'edifici",
          "Beautiful building. The restaurant can do with a bit of upgrading but very fun afternoon overall!",

          "The museum space itself is as impressive as the work on display.",
          "I have been a bit disappointed. The location and the building are spectacular, the views from the terrace very beautiful, but not so many works and a quite chaotic organisation. There are better museums and exhibitions for my taste.",
          "Loved this museum.  Wonderful display of Milo's work in a variety of media.  Certainly highly recommend.  The architecture of the museum is itself worth seeing sitting on a hill overlooking Barcelona. ",

          "The building and location alone are worth checking out. Of course, a great way to experience Mir\u00f3's art.",
          "A small, decent art museum with Miro's artwork plus a few other collections from his friends and followers. When in Montjuic area, it is worth spending some time in modern art. Not many super-famous artworks, but well displayed and \u2026",
          "That is no art at all. It is simply embarrassing to see what people interpret as art. Miro was certainly a great painter, but the collection exhibited at the Miro Foundation seem to be from a very dificult part of Miros life.",

          "Thought provoking collection in a fantastic location.",
          "Love this collection. The building is situated on a mountain overlooking Barcelona. Love it",

          "Great space and exhibition of the artist's work.",

          "It's a nice museum but (ok, I'm not an artist person and you'll laugh at me) I left that museum with a worse perception about Mir\u00f3 production.\n\nOn the other hand, I visited Picasso Museum with very low expectations and I was amazed! So, if you are walking around Barcelona and don't have a lot of time, skip Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation.",
          "Really liked the building. To bad that the natural light is not more used in all the separate rooms. I enjoyed some of the work which is quite diverse throughout the museum. ",

          "Amazing artist. Very good museum.",
          "Miro has an incredible body of work l, but some of his best pieces aren\u2019t in this museum. The foundation definitely gives you a sense of the scope and the scale of his work, but I found the text that guides you through the museum to be fundamentally a misreading of his work.",
          "A very nice museum. Great Cafe there as well with nice Toasties and Coffee.",
          "The museum was build in 1970s but the style of construction is timeless. It s not very big but gathering nice collections of Joan Milo.",
          "Terrific museum.  Was able to walk up gradual incline from the Museum of the History of Art of Catalunya in about 15 min.  Enjoyed the exhibits of Miro and several other s every much.

          "Amazing experience. Worth every dollar spent.",
          "Interesting museum in a perfect location, a must see if you visit Barcelona. Even if you are not particularly fond of Mir\u00f2's paintings you will appreciate Sert's contemporary building and the evolution of Mir\u00f2's art in his unexpected artworks from his youth to his last years",

          "A must visit in Barcelona",
          "Easily my 2nd favourite museum in Barcelona. It is located among the parks of Montjuic, and is very quiet. I prefer this museum to MNAC. There is a wife range of art to be seen. And the terrace is gorgeous. It is a more expensive museum, \u2026",

          "Beautiful experience.. give it at least 3 hours",

        "wiki": "The Park G\u00fcell (Catalan: Parc G\u00fcell [\u02c8pa\u027e\u0261 \u02c8\u0261we\u028e]; Spanish: Parque G\u00fcell) is a public park system composed of gardens and architectural elements located on Carmel Hill, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of Collserola \u2013 the Parc del Carmel is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in La Salut, a neighborhood in the Gr\u00e0cia district of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, Eusebi G\u00fcell assigned the design of the park to Antoni Gaud\u00ed, a renowned architect and the face of Catalan modernism.\nThe park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site under \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\".\n\n\n== Description ==\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his naturalist phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family (Catalan: Sagrada Familia).\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by symbolism, since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political Catalanism \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the Catalan countries are represented \u2013 and from Catholicism \u2013 the Monumento al Calvario, originally designed to be a chapel. The mythological elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the Temple of Apollo of Delphi.On the other hand, many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex iconography that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to religious exaltation, passing through mythology, history and philosophy. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to Freemasonry, despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and Count G\u00fcell. These references have not been proven in the historiography of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and puzzles.\n\n\n== Origins as a housing development ==\n\nThe park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count Eusebi G\u00fcell, after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English garden city movement; hence the original English name Park (in Catalan the name is \"Parc G\u00fcell\"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called Muntanya Pelada (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called La Salut (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the Gaudi House Museum (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.\n\n\n== Municipal garden ==\n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Church.\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion. One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the Barcelona City History Museum MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of Catalan nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator Josep Maria Jujol.Roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching vaulting under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell so that the inverted catenary arch shapes form perfect compression structures.At the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is \"El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus,\" however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (another one of Antoni Guad\u00ed's famous creations), the Agbar Tower, and the Montju\u00efc area visible at a distance.\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of parrot found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including short-toed eagle. The park also supports a population of hummingbird hawk moths.\n\n\n== Gallery of images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Modernisme buildings in Barcelona\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPark Guell website",

          "I'm not a fan of crowds or queues, so when I found Palau Guell, I felt like I had hit the jackpot. Best value for money, no jostling for a better view. Amazing history and beautiful, but practical designs by Gaudi. I loved this but sshhhh let's keep it a secret.",
          "It\u2019s easy to get to on the subway from tourist hotels and historical sights and also easy to book your tickets online for the designated time you want to go. They limited the number of people on the property by the hour so it\u2019s necessary to prepurchase. The other benefits of",
          "It has the best audio guide among other museums / sights. It takes around 1 hour to visit everywhere with audio guide. There is free lockers to put your stuff. Definitely recommend anyone.",
          "This is well worth the time to see the details and imagination of Gaudi. The audio guide tour is really well done-good information, at your own pace, with the ability to stop and start as needed.",
          "The interior is nice, but being one of Gaudi's earlier works, is a little more conventional than most of his buildings. Still great to see, but not as unique. The chimneys, however, are super fun. Wandering around the roof looking at all the neat things he did with them is",
          "I'm aware of Gaudi and saw Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, and even still was blown away by this Palace. The detail, design, thought and genius is hard to describe. You will not regret, book in advance and go!",
          "This was a fascinating building. Some absolutely stunning ceilings and windows. Good value. Audio was a little tricky at first. An amazing roof terrace too well worth a visit.",
          "My advice is get in the park before 8 am before the rush. And watch the sun come up over Barcelona for true magic, you must visit the home of Gaudi and hike to the park over looking the city You will not be disappointed, I suggest grabbing a local bread and some snacks for a",
          "The tiles in the park are quite lovely indeed. However, I was somewhat surprised with the small size of the inner park area, perhaps rendered even smaller by the enormous crowds. The metro with free bus connection is the best way to visit the park, as it is a very long walk",
          "It is NOT deaf friendly. Insufficient English scripts. No booklet in English language for deaf Americans traveling who cannot hear or lipread Catalan language! We were motivated to learn and appreciate cultural richness but missed out a lot the history behind that catheral",
          "A group of us traveled to Barcelona on October 30, 2019...we took a guided tour with Barcelona Day Tours And our experience was wonderful..great guide and a lot of interesting sights..would recommend",
          "Loved this place, the people are extremely nice and the house was lovely. You really get to experience Gaudi's work. We visited the other places of Gaudi designed but was limited to one room or area. However, here you get to see the entire home from the basement to the roof. It",
          "The monumental area is a good introduction to the Gaudi style if you haven't seen much of it before. It is worth the admission price but his best work (to my taste) is elsewhere in the city. However, the park a a whole is wonderful: interestingly designed and built, pretty",
          "We could not stop photographing every detail and every chimney in the building. The highlight is the roof which is an outstanding example of Gaudi's creativity.",
          "A Gaudi playground. Lots to see but as must happen, a fair amount was under scaffolding and being restored. It\u2019s worth the trip. And the Bus G\u00fcell from the Metro worked perfectly. Really well done. Climbing to the top of the park is worth it for the views on a fair day.",
          "Again a must see in Barcelona. Close to the market of the Ramblas. Audio guide gives heaps of info. My kids (13 and 9) tuned in totally. What I really liked is the fact that all the Spanish surveillance/ guards are so super friendly. You can ask them anything and they know it.",
          "This palace is just off La Rambla & the interior visit is well worth the time & money. Designed by Gaudi, the architecture & design was spectacular. The view of the city from the roof top is breathtaking.",
          "Interesting place, full of colours but not so many things to see or houses to visit....I had higher expectations...",
          "It seemed very Medieval! The only thing I have seen in the US that slightly compares in Hearst Castle, which is also very different. The workmanship is astounding and sometimes fanciful.",
          "Having loved Gaudi's ideas of space, textures, colour, architectural concepts for years, to be in his spaces was truly remarkable and awe-inspiring.",
          "We walked past Palau Guell one afternoon, and as there was no queue, thought we would pop in right there and then. It is an absolutely stunning showcase of Gaudi's unusual architecture, and we thought it was the best example of his work, after being to other Gaudi places. It",
          "What you see in the picture is not sufficient to understand what this palace was...not even close. It's hard to imagine the contours, the views and the mosaic features so if you are going to Barcelona include this on your trip.",
          "Wish we had picked Casa Battlo instead. Palace Guell was fine but the whole visit was somewhat less than expected. Early work of the artist and so was less \"like\" the other sites. But, the audio guide was hard to operate (wrong room, wrong narrative and then fixing that was",
          "Worth a visit. The audio tour is very well done. Very clean and easy to tour. Some stairs, be careful.",
          "Palau Guell was never on my list of sights to see. After walking in the Gothic quarter, we had some time to kill before lunch and came across this place. There were no queues and this made our decision easy to buy the tickets and spend some time in the interior. The audio guide",
          "Located right off the main drag in the Gothic Quarter and it was NEVER crowded. Gorgeous interiors and they give you access to the entire home. It is a MUST! Self guided tour was really well done.",
          "We did not actually go in because it was close on Mondays. Had I known that this place was literally steps from our hotel I would have walked over instead of taking an afternoon nap that Sunday. From the outside it looked incredible just like all of Gaudi's designs. A lot of",
          "Wonderful example of work Gaudi did for his wealthy benefactors. Although hard to heat, this would have been a beautiful house to live in.You get an excellent audio tour and can appreciate the architecture and sumptuous decor without being too crowded. A must visit for any Gaudi",
          "Visited solo and picked my time at around 1 pm, when most people seem to eat. Not busy, no wait for ticket, headphone set to talk you through the rooms. I love the easy, set - your - own - pace option of this. Compared to other Gaudi masterpieces, this one is totally different",
          "What a gorgeous park! Visit the Palau of course, and revel in it's beauty, then spend some time walking around the park which is a wonder! Beautifully kept, an oasis in Barcelona!",
          "From a distance it looks like Dr. Seuss took inspiration of this. Perched atop a hill in Barcelona is Palau Guell. You will need to buy a ticket ahead of time, otherwise you will not get it. Gaudi envisioned a housing development complex that unfortunately was not a",
          "Gaudi never disappoints. When in Barcelona, visit all the Guadi that you have time for. His creativity and color combinations are a delight to the eyes.",
          "Maybe a lesser known Gaudi palace. We felt that alongside the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia this completes a wholesome experience. Easy to book tickets in their web site. Even just 1 day in advance. Place is surprisingly lightly toured The roof is captivating Took the audio guide (free)",
          "I am actually a bit disappointed with this since many places or spots were under construction, and it was extremely crowded even i booked it. I mean the time slot was full of tourists. Maybe it is better to book earlier and then you can stay longer without many tourists. I would",
          "This is a great place to experience Gaudi's designs without the crush of tourists at his more popular buildings or the prices. It was just the right amount of information and time for our kids (9 and 12). Audio guides in any language are included in the entrance - my younger",
          "The Palau G\u00fcell is a mansion designed by the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed for the industrial tycoon Eusebi G\u00fcell. It was built between 1886 and 1888. . It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site . It's absolutely beautiful. The wood work, the wrought iron workmanship is",
          "Amazing introduction to Gaudis work. The palace is an amazing work of art . Definitely recommend spending an hour or so doing the tour and I would suggest first doing an overview tour of Gaudi offered by one of the free local tour companies and then doing this and other sites",
          "We had a free day so we visited Palau Guell but I wouldn't go out of your way to put this in your schedule. It was interesting to learn the history of the family.",
          "make sure you visit this park if you have time and buy tickets in advance. The park tickets sold out very fast and they won't allow more than 400 people to visit per day. you will see Gaudi's housing modern designs/color and columns.",
          "Adding this visit to the other Gaudi designed properties gave us more perspective on Gaudi\u2019s genius and how his designs developed over time. Thank goodness there were people willing to take a chance on him early in his career. This is a must see if you are interested in Gaudi.",
          "Amazing building. Opulent, solid, stunning. Nextdoor neighbours rundown, precarious additions... Worth visiting - definitely more than a house!!",
          "I heard from some local guides that this site is often overlooked, but worth a visit. I found it to be the most interesting of the Gaudi houses. Gaudi did not design everything in this house, but I think that it is a must see.",
          "Gaudi designed and built incredible buildings and we believe he was way before his time. Innovative ideas for getting air into and out of his building and having a safe environment for the occupants.",
          "Bought tickets in advance for 8am to avoid crowds. Arrive early and find it\u2019s free before 8 and crowded with selfish people hogging limited spots for photography with multiple selfies or just sitting and looking at their phones. The Park is undergoing significant repair but",
          "Would recommend this place, better than Casa Batllo and half the price. Less crowded and more to see,",
          "This Park which was designed and overseen by Gaudi is awesome. The quirky little things he has added make it almost like being in a Storybook",
          "Several stories but small in overall size - has a hall for concerts, a basement for the horses and carriages, a beautiful living and dining room that is all sculptured with functional and magnificent art. It is the art itself. You couldn't afford it when it was built but you",
          "If you are into architecture and/or Gaudi's work, do yourself a favor and visit Palau Guell. It is NOT the same as the famous Park Guell. The building is amazing.Very close to the Gotic neighborhood.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this beautiful ornate home of the Guell Family. I could live in this house, unlike the other more outlandish, however spectacular Dr. Seuss like dwellings. Don\u2019t miss the basement stable and the decorated rooftop. The entrance dome-like ceiling is beautiful as is the",
          "I feel this is an under rated attraction. If you have not prebooked Parc Guell or Casa Batillo, do not dispair. A visit to this less crowded building is a excellent if not better substitute. This early Gaudi work is incredibly detailed and still has fanciful touches.",
          "Would I go again? Not now I have seen it. This is a stunning building with some really interesting architectural features. You get a great audio guide, that is very informative. They only allow so many visitors in each day which enables you to take your time and take in all",
          "Only \u20ac9 to enter as a student (show any international student ID card) which includes a free audioguide. It is a more Gothic style house than the other Gaudi building but less expensive and no less interesting. Even better because it is less popular there is more space to take",
          "We enjoyed the Palau Guell especially after visiting the Sagrada Familia a couple of days earlier since we didn\u2019t need to pre-book here and thus we could go when we felt like it. I also was relieved at the much more reasonable number of visitors (compared to some of his other",
          "Lovely park with an interesting story especially if you are a fan of Gaudi. Because I was on a Gaudi quest, the candy house architecture of Park Guelle was of particular interest to me. However , it was quite crowded. We were on a guided tour, which was very informative. It made",
          "It is so worthwhile to come here. 12 euros plus audioguide! We bought the ticket online and avoided the lines. This house is amazing in all the architectural details. Such an artistic mixture of wood, tile, wrought iron, and stone. You get to hear a recording of the organ",
          "Gaudi designed this palatial home for his friend, benefactory & patron. It is full of unique and clever design features. Of the many things to see and do in Barcelona, this is also one of the least expensive to visit...and it comes with a pre-recorded tour in a wide variety of",
          "Not as ornate (or expensive) as Casas Batllo and Mila, Palau Guell is definitely worth a visit. You won't find the crowds there, either, so it's easier to go through as a tourist and seems more like a home than a stunt. If you are suffering from Gaudi overload, you may feel like",
          "A Gaud\u00ed building that is unassuming from the outside but quite striking on the inside. There are furnished rooms to see as well as unfurnished. The audio guide is very useful and interesting.",
          "This house / palace is a very interesting building hidden in the centre of Barcelona. We accidentally walked by and took a guided tour. The architecture is very interesting and this visit is recommended for people interested in architecture.",
          "Very impressive architecture. Free tickets on first Sunday was a nice touch. Close to Rambas and across street from my hotel.",
          "My wife and I were staying in the neighborhood and chose to visit this Gaudi shrine. It's a remarkable work of architectural design. as one might expect from Gaudi. Alas, the people who run the place are not on Gaudi's level. You have no problem entering this remarkable former",
          "Pre-booked for the morning before our afternoon flight home. Really pleased we went - fleshed out the history of Guadi and Guell and the house is fascinating. The audio tour in English was really good - interesting musical additions too. Took about an hour overall, so well worth",
          "The building is incredible and worth a visit even if you are not attending an event at the theatre. A great place to dine, shop and stroll. But if you can attend an event here, do so! The theater is fantastic.",
          "Maybe it\u2019s not located in high end neighborhood, it is not as popular as other work of Antony. But Palau guell by no means is a boring design. To the contrary it is one of the more spectacular with many of Gaudis signature design. From rooftop ... to chapel ... to living room",
          "Most beautiful mosaic playground like heaven created on earth. Love the place and Gaudi is so Creative and the place is so beautiful you cannot find another place like this. Enjoy Barcelona and enjoy Gaudi art and enjoy life !! Cheers",
          "If you are coming to Barcelona to explore the work of Gaudi and the Modernista movement, this is an excellent place to start. Here is where the young genius did his early work for one of this great patrons. It's hard to believe until you see it, and you must see it.",
          "Great example of Gaudi\u2019s architectural philosophy. So much to see. Spare plenty of time to take in many of the elements of Gaudi\u2019s design work.",
          "Without hesitation I recommend a visit to the Palau Guell, a mansion house of the Eusebi Guell / Lopez family. The family commissioned Antoni Gaudi to design this home for them and is where they lived before moving to Parc Guell. The space, materials, details, colors, light of",
          "Being able to see the creations close-up and from many angles gives a strong feeling aboutthe work. Very exciting.",
          "We were given complimentary tickets from our hotel, Le Meridien and it was a real gem. We never would have gone if our hotel didn\u2019t offer the tickets. It was hot( little a/c) but very informative with free audio and gaudi art on the rooftop. Lots of great information, good",
          "An interesting home that is quite different from Casa Batllo (except for the roof). Takes about 2 hours to visit.",
          "I visited Palau Guell on a free entrance day, but not sure if I would pay the full price. The rooftop is very interesting, like Casa Mila's, but the rest is not as impressive as Casa Batllo or Casa Mila. On the other hand, I can imagine that normally it is far less crowded than",
          "Gorgeous place so beautiful. Well worth doing a tour our guide was so informative and funny. So much more to know about the history of it and the architect.",
          "Really cool place for a visit. If it is raining you cannot see the roof because it is dangerous (which was my case) and was still totally worth it. The insides of the house is amazing.",
          "This fantastic off the beat and path palace is a great place to spend an hour or so. Cost is 12 euros. There is a free audio guide that was easy to follow and provided interesting information on the palace. There are stairs and ramps to maneuver but I saw an elevator so it may",
          "It was one of the highlights of my Barcelona trip. I really enjoyed the visit with the audioguide. It is so classy and beautiful. My favorite Gaud\u00ec chef d'oeuvre.",
          "Our visit to the Palau Guell was great. We booked our tickets for the morning, so we were some of the first people of the day. The audio guide was amazing with a lot of great details about the architecture and relationship of Gaudi and Guell.",
          "It is an amazing place, and the audio is good. It gets a bit hot inside, so you might want to plan this stop early in the day.",
          "I stumble across this residence as I was wandering the streets. The exterior looks kind of cool but I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay to see the inside. I'm glad I decided to go in. The interiors are dramatic, beautiful, intricate. The rooftop has the amazing mosaic work of",
          "An often missed treasure in the heart of the city. Built in an area thought to be up and coming, this palace off the Rambla is definitely worth a stop from the typical cathedrals and shopping.",
          "Even if you don\u2019t know who Gaudi was ( a famous architect of the Modernista period in Bar Elena) this palace will put you in a state of wa. Gaudi was ahead of his time and even ours!",
          "An attractive and well proportioned building, far more conventional that Gaudi's other designs. It sits in a small narrow street and is difficult to photograph, unfortunately it was closed the day we visited, check opening hours before visiting.",
          "Love the visit at this park in Barcelona, it is a must see if you are visiting the city. Will need about 2 hours.",
          "We toured the Palau, and it was so much more interesting than we expected! Also, it was very sparsely attended, so we could take our time and really look, listen, and learn about Gaudi's first private house. The rooftop is spectacular, as is the lovely organ in the small",
          "One of a few of Gaudi's spectacular architectural masterpieces here in Barcelona. It is like all the rest of his works, a MUST SEE. From the ground up it is amazing. He truly was a man before his time.",
          "Had a free tickets from our hotel-Le Meridien. Interesting architecture.Roof was the most impressive part.",
          "I hadnt heard about this one before we got to Barcelona. But very happy we went to check it out. Its just off la rambla. Very well preserved and the audio guide was very good too.",
          "cheap than others gaudi buildings. first sunday of the month the ticket is free. It's not as crowded as La Pedrera or Casa Batllo.",
          "What a beautiful mansion designed by a genius. There is so much attention to detail, and the details are quirky but mesh so well. The self guided tour was a great help to understand Gaudi and his relationship with the Guell family. As we were walking past the \"chapel\" , the",
          "A must if visiting Barcelona! Such an incredible park and to see the design of Gaudi in this setting is awesome!",
          "Pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem. A beautiful home with wonderful architecture and furnishings. Audio guide included was very informative. Allow about an hour to get through the entire palace.",
          "Another stunning work done by Gaud\u00ed. Surprising location just of la Ramba. Many well period preserved rooms. Self guided audio tour very helpful.",
          "This was a self-guided tour of a house using a headset provided by the people that managed the building. We went in mid-June and found this to be easy to handle. The tour is self-paced and you can listen to the explanations as many times as you want. This is a mansion that Gaud\u00ed",
          "We chose to explore Palau Guell since it is a more concentrated example of Gaudi's work. You get a audio guide with the price of admission and as you walk through you get a good explanation of what you're looking at. the detail of the wood work is exceptional and when you get to",
          "On a hot and humid July day - a visit to this wonderful artistic, inspiring oasis was like a tonic.The textures and shapes Gaudi used in this house are perhaps a little more rustic than at some of his other buildings , but i loved the contrast of the textured stone and brick to",
          "Gaudi designed this house for Eusebi Guell. It has a different style compared to his other buildings. It is luxuriant, expensive and gloomy. It is worth paying a visit to this classical mansion full of symbols.",
          "We saw this place when we walked past, thought it looked interesting and as there was no queue we bought tickets there and then. We were not disappointed, a fascinating insight into the early life of Gaudi and well worth a visit.",
          "I visited G\u00fcell Palace for the second time in Barcelona. This time, the price of the visit included an audio guide that was very helpful. I recommend to schedule about 1.5 hours to get a leisurely look at everything.",
          "A beautiful Gaud\u00ed designed home for the Uber wealthy Guell family of Barcelona. The stables and carriage house, bedrooms and terrace are pretty incredible but it was uncomfortably hot and stuffy in the residence. Top floor only is air conditioned and thankfully it wasn\u2019t too",
          "This palace was directly across the street from our wonderful hotel. A must do to see Gaudi's first works. Really interesting how he designed such a home for a large family. The corner apartments may be better according to the travel books but this was worth the visit. How",
          "A lesser known and lesser crowded Gaudi work. This place was a private residence for Mr Guell and was one of early Gaudi's design. As it is less known, it is not as busy and expensive as other Gaudi's building. It is situated near La Rambla and is easily missed from the outside.",
          "Fabulous house on street just off the Rambla. You'd never guess from looking at it from the exterior that it is an amazing place inside. Well worth a detour. Great audio description, easy to follow whilst traveling through each too. A Must",
          "We took a tour with Get Your Guide. We have noticed that with Get Your Guide they are not gret about organization or the meeting points. However, our guide was Sylvia and she was very knowledgeable.",
          "If you like architecture, Gaudi, or even just enjoy a beautiful home, then you won't be disappointed. The Palau Guell is simply beautiful, both inside and outside, with some clever innovations at the time for optimising the whole building and making it a wonderful home. I",
          "As most of other reviews put it, this is one of Gaudi\u2019s most spectacular works. It\u2019s true the building doesn\u2019t look much from the outside - but the insides will let you appreciate the true masterpieces of Gaudi\u2019s early works.",
          "Avoid the crush at La Pedrera. This first major interior design work by Anton Gaudi is more digestible. Hats off to cement monopolist Guell, who appreciated art (unlike his industrialist dad) and funded Gaudi before he became \"Gaudi\". Ironwork creativity, outstanding. Imagine",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this building. I felt that after the Sagrada Familia and the Parc Guell, this was the most interesting Gaudi work I've seen.",
          "We were two families from Texas spending 2 weeks on a European vacation, visiting London, Paris and Barcelona European 14 Day trip from Texas. We had spent months planning this trip, to get the best bang for our bucks and see as many sites as possible. This was the last of the 4",
          "This mansion is a must seen for all visitors not just for the Gaudi enthusiasts. The visit comes with a free audioguide (several languages available) and covers most of the palau's many areas. The self-guided tour has a duration of about 1 hour. The building seems severe but",
          "Stroll at your own leisure through this beautiful park. Take a seat and relax on beautiful mosaic benches. Marvel at the creations of Gaudi and his genius with light. A definite must see when in Barcelona.",
          "This may have been Gaudi\u2019s first large construction project, but he did an incredible job. We arrived early and found a short lineup. We bought tickets at the reduced price with our passports because we are seniors. There is a separate line for ticket holders but it was also",
          "Heard the classical guitars and saw amazing flamenco dancing. The UNESCO Palau is well worth the visit.",
          "Good spot to visit but be aware of the tour groups. Preferable to be visited off-season.Take time to enjoy the little details.",
          "Another building by Gaudy that doesn't disappoint. Charming and architectonically surprising and very interesting. Quick but very informative place.",
          "I found it is a less popular or better say crowded Gaud\u00ed house and it is worth to see as it has beautiful details. We arrived early and site purchased the tickets so haven't waited too long. They give free audio guides and provide a locking room if you have luggage which is",
          "Sometimes you get lucky when you are travelling and we were given free tickets to enter this Gaudi masterpiece. Maybe it was because we are over 65 or maybe because it was a public holiday, I don't know but it was a fabulous treat. The continuity of style throughout the",
          "This tour offers an audio guide which is fantastic. This property is truly a masterpiece and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It takes about an hour or so to get through the house with the guide. One room is more magnificent than the next",
          "Anything by Gaudi is worth visiting, he was a master of his craft and a visionary. Not only did he design beautiful buildings be he had to invent new methods of building to make them work. This park is no exception and is a must see. Visit his appointment and se how simply this",
          "This palace was the residence of Guell Family and was the first or one of the first works of Gaudi. Every corner of the house has an amazing detail! It is very easy to go there since it is in the Ramblas",
          "It's not apparent from the street, but this Gaudi-designed house, well ok, palace, built for wealthy industrialist Guell is a spacious, over-the-top structure inside. The detailed features and rooms were amazing, and the rooftop gives a small taste of what Gaudi did with La",
          "We opted to attend a concert in the theater. The classical concert was wonderful with the audience giving the performers several standing ovations. The real star, however, is the hall, which is breathtaking. Tickets are very reasonably priced compared with other cities and the",
          "Words cannot adequately describe the incredible beauty of this Gaudi house. Every room and every surface is thought out and detailed with an amazing use of materials and intense beauty; the wrought iron, the floors, the ceilings ...just everything all the way up to the roof",
          "This place near to Las Ramblas was relatively quiet - meaning you can take time to enjoy the complex architecture and take loads of photos. You get to explore from the basement to the roof. Guell was one of Gaudi's greatest supporters - and the architecture in this building is",
          "Please don\u2019t miss this extraordinary home that introduces you to the genius of Gaudi. Be in the moment and absorb the visual artistry of a man who introduced his clients and thereby the world with his incredible insight and translation in architecture and art.",
          "Strangely we didn't come across this as a must see in our guide book but happened upon it late in the afternoon when strolling down Las Ramblas and just walked in and bought tickets. No queues and no guided groups. It was Gaudi's first commission for the industrialist",
          "We design furniture, mostly Art Deco style and then to find Gaudi over these past years and to visit his works. Wonderful legacy and frankly - not to be repeated structural designs. his use of light and openings as well as massing and structure is beyond most of us. All thanks",
          "Gaudi's town house for entertaining. Interesting, especially the central light well and rooftop, and we went at 7pm (closes at 8pm) so very few people. (I would imagine it would be quite difficult to work your way around if very busy). Worth the trip",
          "This was my favourite of the main Gaudi houses. It\u2019s not as busy and so had room to move around. The audio guide was very good.",
          "This building is one of Gaudi's first commissions - and while it is interesting in itself, it really needs to be paired with Casa Battlo to see where his ideas developed to over time.",
          "Astonishing inside, a little \"heavier\" in style than the rest of Gaud\u00ed' s works. But more suitable for a palace. Buy your souvenirs here, than the rest of the shops in Gaud\u00ed's buildings; better prices. I visited on rainy day, so the rooftop was closed.",
          "I've included details on my Park Guell review. Buy tickets online in advance and if possible time for beginning or end of day.",
          "So glad we stopped her, totally unplanned. Add this to your must-sees. So interesting and well done. Free electronic guide which is educational and easy to understand. Beautiful art and gives you further insight to the genius Gaudi. Warning: lots and lots of steps.",
          "We went round on a Wednesday morning with a self guided audio tour. Absolutely stunning!! I love Gaudi anyway; but this is the icing on the cake. Not his best known; but a must see.",
          "Mr. Guell was rich beyond compare and his house designed by Gaudi is as stunning as you would expect for a man whose net worth in 1895 was the equivalent of 70 billion (yes, billion) euros in today's currency. Simply gorgeous. If you are a fan of fantastic architecture and",
          "This is one of Gaudi's early architectural works and we were impressed with his innovative designs and attention to detail. No expense was spared in the building of this and it shows. It is less, shall we say outrageous, than later works, so has good appeal to most.",
          "Inspired and amazed. Palau Guell is the epitome of Art in function. The architecture is breathtaking and the designs of Antoni Gaudi are ahead of their time. A must see if you\u2019re in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.",
          "This was the Guell family house and it does have some unique Gaudi features. Only 9 euros for ticket and audio guide which was nice as you didn\u2019t have to book in advance and it was not crowded even in peak tourist season.",
          "Our hotel faced here and had great views from our rooftop terrace. The facade of the palace is amazing.",
          "My husband and I visited this early work of Gaudi on 7/19/2018. Cost was 18\u20ac/$21.02 for the 2 of us-discounted rate. Included audio guide which is available in several languages. Located in the El Raval neighborhood. Just off La Rambla. We spent around 2 hours here. Gaudi",
          "This home, designed by Gaudi for the Guell family was fabulous! We used the free audio tour and saw all of the home. This is one property where you get to see most of the building. I especially enjoyed hearing the pipe organ play. The genius of Gaudi is on full display in the",
          "A nice place to visit right in the center of las Ramblas. No big queue at the enterence which I loved",
          "An excellent example of Gaud\u00ed architecture, Spanish Art Nouveau. There is the rooftop terrace overlooking the city. The interior is amazing, the tour guides explains everything in small details, difficult to describe in words, a must see to understand Gaud\u00ed world. FYI every",
          "What a beautiful, over-the-top experience this was! All tours are artfully guided throughout the Art Nouveau music space. If you are in Barcelona this is a MUST SEE for an overall perspective of the Nouveau movement It is really indescribable - everywhere you look is spectacular",
          "This palace designed by the young Gaud\u00ed is absolutely breathtaking. You don\u2019t need a guided tour pay 12euro and you get a free audio guide which explains everything. You can take pictures and spend as long as you like going round. Highly recommended.",
          "Very interesting house built in early 1900\u2019s. House had chapel with organ with beautifully carved staircase and lots of marble. Be certain to visit roof and basement.",
          "We\u2019ve been lucky not to find any people queuing in front of the palace. So even if we weren\u2019t supposed to enter... we actually bought the ticket and go for the visit. Strongly recommended. A very interesting palace. It takes not more than an hour and it\u2019s very different from",
          "Have visited all Gaudi buildings as am a massive fan and was really interesting to see this house which was a very early work and more of a renovation that\u2019s other projects. It certainly has the wow factor and an interesting history which you learn about as you move through the",
          "At first, looking from the outside, I was considering passing on the visit. What a mistake that would have been! The creativity of design and workmanship in this building is beyond imagination (and $ budget!). As we ventured through, with an electronic device explaining what we",
          "You'll spend at least 30 minutes touring the house. You must buy tickets in advance so plan to purchase then return. It's worth touring especially if you are on La Rambla.",
          "It\u2019s very close to the subway station, just 5 min walk, if you are wandering in the city, don\u2019t miss this. Inside, you can find the those antique",
          "Very important building by Gaudi. the design and the architectural feature are a must see, from the basement to the rooftop.",
          "This is an aboslute GEM, not far from La Rambla. Went there on a whim, but utterly enjoyed it. It's a fantastic place, especially the central chamber/room and the roof ofcourse. Recommended",
          "After seeing many of Gaudi\u2019s amazing works, I\u2019d say, Start Here. As one of Gaudi\u2019s early projects, this shows his early thinking \u2013 that you\u2019ll see more fully developed and refined in Casa Battl\u00f3, Vasa Milo and Sagrada Familia.",
          "After visiting Casa Mila (La Pedrera) and La Sagrado, this was not my favorite and could be passed if you done the other two which are more interesting and not so far out. However, it has a good view of Barcelona once you get on the roof park but everything else is very Gauldi.",
          "This was my second favorite Gaudi attraction, after Sagrada Familia. Get a timed ticket. The roof is fantastic and the relationship between Guell and Gaudi is fascinating and described very well.",
          "One of works of Gaudi. This is the reinterpretation of the Venetian palace. Very interesting entrance with metal decorations.",
          "An interesting experience. Excellent audio guide available. The climb to the rooftop is well worth the effort.",
          "We decided to visit after not being able to secure tickets for Parc Guell. As we went to buy the tickets we were told that it was free entry that day (23rd of April) and that out time was 6pm. We arrived slightly early as instructed. When we entered we were given a free audio",
          "Palau Guell is one of Gaudi\u2019s best pieces of architecture, right in the heart of the city. Magnificent on every one of the 5-6 levels including the rooftop. The dome is unexpected and so many other features of a beautiful palace. Recommend this as highly as is possible. Don\u2019t",
          "Barcelona is a great place to visit. its history and wonderful guides add much to bringing this great place alive.definitely to be recommended.",
          "If you like Gaudi's architecture, it is unfair to miss this gem. It's less crowded than Pedrera for example, hence can be more enjoyable. Lots of details worth to be discovered with the included audio guide. It definitely deserves a visit also for the roof terrace.",
          "We booked tickets online the day before which worked out cheaper and made it easier when arriving. Amazing example of Gaudi\u2019s work and we were able to explore each room. It\u2019s definitely worth using the audio tour which explains each room clearly on the way around. It took us",
          "Get tickets in advance, specially in summer when so many tourists want to get in. The architecture, details in decoration....all so Guadi. The first palace he designed and constructed for the Guell Family. It's near the Ramblas and the Royal Plaza.",
          "This is not the tipical house of Gaudi, it is in the area of raval. Very good palace. But there is plenty of people and the qeuee is large",
          "I feel this is slightly underrated! This was one of my favourite places to see - it was beautifully done and has a lot to see! Wasn\u2019t too crowded, so you walk around with the audio guide at your own pace, whilst learning the history. Worth a visit if you are in Barcelona!",
          "We had the great fortune to get tickets free through our hotel. What a beautiful example of Gaudi\u2019s genius. We really loved learning about him through his art.",
          "The 7 UNESCO Heritage Sites By Gaudi 1). Sagrada Familia  2). Casa Mila \u2013 La Pedrera  3). Parc Guell 4). Guell Palace  5). Casa Batllo  6). Casa Vicens 7). The Crypt of the Colonia Guell #1, #2, #3, all have extremely long lines. The tickets to #1 are over 7 days in advance.",
          "This multi-story residence built for Gaudi's patron and friend Eusebio Guell, was my favorite. From the stables on the lower level (with their graceful brick arches and clever design) to the dramatic chapel and the family's living quarters, we were impressed by the",
          "This gaudi building has less queues and is cheaper (5 euros for up to 17 year old) than casa batila and casa mila. It's in the centre of town and well worth a visit. We're so glad we went.",
          "This is a fascinating way to spend a couple of hours in the heart of the city. I learned a lot about both Gaudi's design, but also about the relationship between Gaudi and his primary benefactor, Guell.",
          "If you have to choose to visit only one of Gaudi\u2019s works, make it Palau G\u00fcell. It\u2019s an amazing tour of the entire house, with very detailed audio guide included into the ticket price. Rooms, terraces, roof, and even stables are open to see, very beautifully restored and",
          "Fascinating place, not just as a display of Gaudi's infinite artistry but as an illustration of how Barcelona's economic elite lived. It's more comprehensive than Casa Battlo -- and the entry fee is half the price!",
          "Far from city centre and you need really enough energy to go around this park. Very nice place to buy souvenir from pavement stalls.",
          "Pictures do not do justice to this Gaudi gem. Stunning detail and beauty. Gaudi was a genius- do not miss this tour",
          "We lived in an apartment for two weeks next door to Palau Guell and just before leaving Barcelona decided to take a look. Very thankful we did to take in the beautiful treasures found inside and up on the roof.",
          "Very close to Las Ramblas, but yet not fully discovered by the tourists. Well worth the visit. Once again Gaudi is extraordinary!",
          "Very interesting visit of this beautiful and original 'Palau Guell'. I however had a hard time with the bad quality of the audio guide, the staff should definitely do something about this.",
          "Well worth a visit as well as the recently opened Casa Vincens. Both exude originality and are Gaudi icons.",
          "This is an early Gaudi structure and very interesting. There's a stable in the basement and the ironwork is excellent throughout the house. The highlight is the rooftop. Not a great view but still surprising and interesting.",
          "Who could believe that this building would be so beautiful!! On the outdide maybe it is not attractive but it is worth it to visit!!",
          "I'm still surprised that this isn't more popular. It gets overlooked by Sagrada Familia or Park Guell perhaps. But we loved it and it was less expensive and less stressful not needing a timed ticket.",
          "Much more impressive interior than exterior. Near Rambla. Fun rooftop. The audio guide was good for us.",
          "Was wandering by when I saw the sign. Bought a ticket and got immediate entry (around 2pm on a Friday) and had a great time taking in the incredible design and architecture.",
          "Reasonably priced, you could easily miss it. Well worth the visit and would be enough Gaudi if you were on a short trip. Organ playing in the background was haunting but also added mood and atmosphere.",
          "When I visited Barcelona, Casa Batllo (while still open) was under renovation, so in order to see some residential Gaudi, I went to Palau Guell. The audio guide offers a detailed explanation of the rooms and the relationship between Guell and Gaudi. Guell gave him an early",
          "This place is very colourful, lots of history into the making of this place, check out the mosaic, this should not be missed.",
          "The free audio guide is a bit too thorough at times, but it\u2019s a fraction of the cost of some of the other Gaud\u00ed attractions. There are some true gems to see in this place and it\u2019s not too crowded. The dome, the bay window and most of all the roof are well worth seeing.",
          "This is a must visit for anyone interested in Gaudi's work and the connection with Guell. To see so many new ideas all put to work in one home was amazing. The audio guide was very detailed, not only regarding the materials and their specific purposes but also the life of the",
          "Audioguide excellent and not boring at all. The place itself is really amazing and still interesting even if you have already seen casa Battllo or Mila. And what\u2019s more no queue or hassle",
          "Palau Guell was down the street from my hotel and I had ignored it in years past. This Palace was a revelation in the early development of Gaudi's architectural beginning and growth. I must recommend going all the way up to the roof. Gaudu's inventive mosaics are so fanciful. He",
          "The weather wasn\u2019t too good and we were looking for something inside. If you are interested in Gaudi, go there. Even if the weather is good, it is impressive to see what he created!",
          "Another example of what Gaudi did best. It is tucked on a side street off La Rambla and worth a quick diversion to see.",
          "We visit on Friday morning only to find that the site was closed due to a strike. Whilst I am in full support of the reasons for the strike and march as part of International Women's Day, I am very disappointed that the website if the attraction was still accepting bookings and",
          "Saw the sign when walking the Ramblas, so glad we went. Late afternoon, no queues, no crowds. Good audio guide give you plenty of information. Beautiful hand-carvings and so much detail. Loved the roof terrace and the chimneys. Well worth a visit.",
          "A couple of weeks ago my husband and I had the opportunity to tour this palace designed by Gaudi. The architecture was amazing. Don't forget to look up at all the ceilings! Absolutely stunning!",
          "This is the cheapest Gaudi experience you could possibly get, but still pretty interesting and with a very nice audio guide. The palace is definitely not as different as the other Gaudi buildings but it feels more authentic and there is more of it that's preserved and available",
          "It is a great building. Go and see it. It is right next to Las Ramblas. Dear Trip advisor there is nothing else to say ;)",
          "Great tour and restoration. A real bargain and great audio and visual tour. The Palau is beautiful. I particularly enjoyed seeing the basement carriage and horse area the brick work was amazing.",
          "This seriously may be my favorite site in Barcelona (besides Sagrada). My friend and I had no clue this existed until we came upon it looking for something to do. Very cheap tickets... the student price was \u20ac11. Like I saw in another review, definitely the cheapest of all",
          "Cheaper than most of Gaudi s residences /museums and well worth a visit. Fantastic architecture and you must go onto the roof.",
          "In the heart of Barca's historical area is the museum. Crowds were a little busy but that's what happens i guess. Def recommend.",
          "This was a great place to visit. Make sure you go early so you are not there with the crowds. Give yourself plenty of time to visit this home. You will need it. The audio tour was great because it was very helpful.",
          "Not your average Joe\u2019s residence.....I made it for a free tour just by dumb luck, and the waiting line really wasn\u2019t bad at all, because they have Timed Entry specified. The place is fabulous, even if I wouldn\u2019t want to live there. It\u2019s a marvel.",
          "At last minute, we decided to take a tour of this house. It seems out of place in its location, but beautiful! You receive an audio guide upon entry. That was a nice feature. You can go through all of the rooms and then stand on the roof. Great view of the neighborhood!",
          "Built by Gaudi, this is slightly less organic in feel that some of his other works in the city, but nonetheless impressive, I particularly liked the dragon above the ground floor entrance.",
          "My luck it was because this museum I ta was located near Onix Liceo hotel, so I had privilege to visit. It was very interesting with chance to learn and accumulate many knowledge .",
          "Build by Gaudi for his friend and patron Guell. Handcarved, everything is a magnificent tribute to a golden age of money and privilege. Handsets are free and guide you around. 5 star",
          "Step in the world of a rich family in the beginning of the 20th century. What a wealth, what a beautiful use of material. Very interesting Gaudi monument.",
          "Admission was 12 euros each, which was a bit expensive for what you are able to see. The audio guide helps explain a lot of the rooms in the building, but you have to enjoy architecture if you want to avoid getting too bored by a full tour. The roof was probably the best part of",
          "Palau G\u00fcell with Parc G\u00fcell are the crown jewels of Barcelona and a visit to the city will be incomplete without a visit to both",
          "If you stay at Le Meridien you get complimentary access to this site and it\u2019s worth a visit to see Gaudi\u2019s creations in this palatial family home. The design and detail was before it\u2019s time and the way it is preserved is exceptional.",
          "It's not a park. It's a failed housing area for wealthy Barcelonans. And the developer's loss is our gain. It's a hard-to-describe magical place. Definitely take the guided tour. Our guide Jeff (Not sure what his name was in Catalan) was knowledgeable, charming, and quite the",
          "We toured Palau Guell and enjoyed it very much. Compared to the other Gaudi attractions it was empty which made the visit very nice. The home is magnificent and is just off of La Rambla. They even have a rooftop Terrance to take in great city views. All in all this is",
          "We finally made it to the Palau Guell on our last day in Barcelona. This was the outstanding visit of the trip. When I was last in the Palau in 1973 it was almost in ruins and being used by a local theatre group. The house has now been lovingly restored, and the audioguided",
          "We bought our tickets in advance and easily and quickly entered the palace. We had our own guide, who was charming and knowledgeable. This is yet another way to experience and admire Gaudi's architecture and well worth the ticket. We stayed in Hotel DO off the Placa Reial, and",
          "This building has a lovely charm about it and is situated in a small road just off of La Rambla. To get it's full benefits you need to pay the twelve euros to go inside but unfortunately that was way above my budget.",
          "Really interesting inside, everything in perfect condition. So much detail in the wood and metal furnishings. Fascinating lifestyle during those times. The rooftop chimneys are beautiful. Highly recommended, book online in advance.",
          "Palau Guell is not as extravagant from the outside as Batllo, and few things are. But I found the interior to be a good as. Another plus is it didn't seem a crowded as other Gaudi attractions. I brought in advance and had an audio guide. Value-wise it is a bit expensive. No",
          "In English \u201cgaudy\u201d has a different connotation to what you will find traveling in Barcelona. His genius at engineering architecture and interior design were decades ahead of all. To understand his functional approach to solve problems are incredible. Strongly suggest that one",

          "This is the best visit of all the Gaudi houses. You can tour the entire edifice and enjoy all the interior views that Gaudi set up. The woodwork, ceramics, and metalwork are outstanding. The roof terrace is spectacular. The best curated of all the Gaudi houses. When we were",
          "The entrance fee is reasonable and the building is nice. It is an interesting place. It takes about 1.5 hour to see the place,",
          "We spent all day walking to various historical land marks. This building is basically a shell, it has displays of the history of the building and what it stood for. There's a number of rooms to visit and gets quite busy.",
          "We were in the area so popped in for a late afternoon visit. The audio tour was very good. The home is incredible. Gaudi had such an incredible mind to be able to envision such a wonderful design. Enjoyed hearing the organ play and the rooftop deck was very interesting.",
          "I think the price is too expensive for the place. It does have great architecture though. I love that there are many rooms to see. Nothing to see underground. Don't miss the chance to go to the rooftop and see the city view. With that kind of price, I guess you deserve at least",
          "A must for lovers of Gaud\u00ed. Good audio tour included in the admission cost. Ven if you visit casa Milla and Casa Barillio bec,Sue\u2019s th.e others are appartmments an.d this is G\u00fcell\u2019s home for his family",
          "Located in el raval just steps from the rambla this is a must visit for all visitors. Entrance fee is only \u20ac12 and it includes the audio guide which is excellent. This was Gaudi\u2019a first major project and you can see him playing with materials and spaces which continued to get",
          "This gem is very important to understand the close relationship between A.Gaudi and his patron and close friend the wealthy aristocrat E.Guell who commissioned Gaud\u00ed to design and build this small scale palace near La Rambla- sparing no expense. You can visit it and see how",
          "Beautiful house with incredible features. Great audio guide explains the rich history and exhibitions and movies bring the history and style of Gaudi alive.",
          "The Palau Guell shows what happens when creativity meets a financial backer. This house is a tour de force of engineering masterpiece. From the lower level stables to the rooftop. Such thought. Such quality materials. A must see, as is everything Gaudi..",
          "This isn't a massive house (like Casa Mila for example) but it is VERY beautiful. Superb detailing - if you were to visit only one Gaudi house apart from the Sagrada, then this would be my choice. Although why visit only one more? Casa Mila (La Pedrera) and Casa Battlo are also",
          "Palau Guell was ten minutes' walk from our hotel so we saved it for our final morning in Barcelona. We were lucky to get there in time to visit the roof before the rain made it too slippery, so go on a sunny day if you can. Gaudi's beautiful chimney-piece sculptures and the",

          "Was walking around when I saw this building and had to take a look! It worth the visit! I's incredible and fascinating all the work from Gaudi. Also, you have a free audioguide included in your ticket and i recommend to get one, because it explain every single room of this",
          "The Palau itself is more than interesting with bits of Gaudis magic dotted about. Then you go on the roof. It is FANTASTIC, with many stacks conic spires and sheer beauty Worth going for the roof top and views alone. It also has a very good shop with some excellent Gaudi books",
          "It's a unique grand town house in the centre of Barcelona. The details of design are fascinating and the place gives great insight into life in Barcelona as well as Gaudi's work. It's not a large palace; the detail and innovation stand out, not the scale. We took a guided tour",
          "Earlier Gaudi design but more complete than Casa Batllo with Gaudi designed furnishings and more rooms to visit",
          "Park full of people. Wonderful view of the city and imaginative view of future housing but essentially a failed housing model. Found it a bit disappointing because of the build up.",
          "A wonderful introduction to Gaudi's work. Fun for a fantasy look in how people ( well the well establised) lived",

          "Palau Guell was very nice. We liked the audio guide. It was like being there when it was an active house. Very interesting to know about the architecture and little details Guell created in that house. Really enjoyed it.",
          "I spent a good time walking throughout Palau Guell....up and down the stairs, in and out of rooms and stables, all built which such class and style. Very unique!!",
          "It is near La Rambla on the right when you go in the see direction. It is interesting to see it inside, but have to buy ticket",
          "This palace makes brilliant use of the confined space of its site. The features such as the central dome, the basement for stabling and the way the light can be controlled is remarkable.",
          "The house is a real Gaudi mixture of materials and designs. The presentation is well explained in the audio guide but some exhibitions are only in Spanish. When the organ plays it is magic for the ears. \ud83c\udfbc\ud83c\udfbc",

          "From the moment you enter the building you are enthralled. The architecture has to be seen to be believed,it is a wonderful way to see Gaudi from the inside. The further you go up the building the more fantastic it gets. The roof of the building is unbelievable and is a must see",
          "We were absolutely stunned by this place! It's really a must while you're in Barcelona. The tickets price was reasonable also, we paid \u20ac28 for 2 adults and 1 child. It was totally worth it!",
          "Helpful docents (I required use of elevator). Interesting early work of Gaudi. Liked all the wood. Roof sculptures not my thing, but Gaudi lovers would like them.",
          "This was a beautiful house and the basement is particularly interesting. There are lots of stairs and uneven surfaces when you visit. It didn't happen to be very busy when we were there and we were able to go in a half hour earlier than our timed ticket stated.",
          "I was highly encouraged to come here but was underwhelmed. Having been to Park Guell and seen other famous Gaudi sites, this was not such a great attraction for me. This is about Guell's rich lifestyle. Ho-hum. HOWEVER, I will say that the rooftop is awesome with all its ceramic",
          "This is a another must see for Gaudi fans. I was in awe of every room and even the rooftop is stunning,do not miss....",
          "This family home was designed by Antoni Gaudi for the Guells at the beginning of his career. The attention to detail is incredible. It has a relatively small footprint but the central hall soars to the skylight on the roof, and many if the rooms adjoin this area. I especially",
          "This was so quaint and beautiful. Bring your camera. You will love seeing this place. We spent a long time in there looking everywhere.",
          "This was our fourth visit to a Gaudi museum and our favourite. A very dignified house with beautiful ornate ceilings, wrought iron work and furnishings. It comes across as a home with great attention paid to practicality and purpose before the artistic flair was overlaid. Really",
          "It is located very close to the Rambla de los Capuchinos, in the heart of Old Town Barcelona, in a street that does not allow you to contemplate with too much perspective its sober main facade. It was the first important work of Gaudi, coinciding with his \"orientalist\" stage.",
          "A nice walk round. Not a huge building but lots to see. Best bits are the basement and the roof. Our audio guides kept going back to the start but managed to sort them.",
          "Out of all the museums and parks we went to see in Barcelona this was our favorite. It was easy to get to off La Rambla. Prices are very reasonable considering you'll spend a few hours in here if you want to see everything. The included audio guide was well thought out and",
          "We were offered free admission from LeMeridien hotel. This was the first of Gaudi's work we visited while in Barcelona, the other two being Parc Guell and the Sagrada Familia. It was interesting, particularly to see how he envisioned very different projects. Worthwhile visit.",
          "We stumbled across this one day and it happened to be free admission. We took the tour and it was worth our time. I would highly recommend you visit.",
          "SO many levels and so much to see that you cannot believe what your senses receive for the visit. The audio-guide is one of the best I encountered in Spain. I believe there were elevators, but ability to climb helps. AMAZING! Don't miss it!",
          "We actually spent several nights at the Gaudi Hotel directly across the street from Palau Guell. On our final day before leaving Barcelona on a Mediterranean cruise, we took a couple hours to tour the museum. My wife has mobility issues and we received phenomenal help from",
          "I happened to pick up a leaflet for this in passing and we decided to go and have a look. I can honestly say that it took my breath away and used up every superlative that I have. It is simply stunning .",
          "Visited this ornate house designed by Gaud\u00ed. Audioguide was excellent, we arrived early so not too name people. Beautiful designs inside and out.Lovely views from the roof, especially the ornate chimneys. Not a place for small children.",
          "This is well worth a visit with comprehensive audio explanations of Gaudi\u2019s development of architectural ideas. The buildings has stunning design features which I found really interesting. The rooftop is covered in quirky chimneys of various colours. I happened to be passing",
          "This wonderful facility, just off the Rambla, provides a fascinating view of the early Gaudi (and the generosity of the Guell family.",
          "Palau Guell is just a short walk away from the vivid La Rambla. This quiet palace has many beautiful treasures to offer whoever that comes to visit. A free audioguide is included with the ticket (12 euro = adult, 5 Euro under 18) The Audioguide is a necessary tool to open the",
          "We fitted in seeing Palau Guell inbetween going to Park Guell in the morning and our time slot at Sagrada Famillia(3.15pm). We didnt pre book, but there was no queue. Audio guide was free. We spent about an 1hr here. It was a quiter space compared to the bigger tourist",
          "This a magnificent mansion and another example of the genius of Gaud\u00ed. It was interesting how he was able to meet the family\u2019s needs while staying true to his style.",
          "I like the architecture there- too much stone, wood, big and many rooms. I would say that it's a bit dark inside but who cares. The mane room with the Chappel is a place to see and also the room with the unique chimenies and the view.",
          "We happened to be walking on Las Ramblas when to our right there was this house. We went in and again Mr Gaudi performed The Guell family been one of the richest in Barcelona made a home that can envy anyone and to duplicate and impossibility",
          "Guell family Palace featuring Gaudi's Architecture. A Gaudi creation off the beaten path reflects his creativity and unique style. Beauty and elegance from the Horse livery to the rooftop. Mable, light, granite, wood, iron and glass, mosaics utilized to accentuted the ornate",
          "It was our first time in Barcelona, and we had only 3 days to go around. We wanted to see at least of Gaudi\u2019s masterpieces from the inside, and we chose this. It didn\u2019t disappoint. It took around 45 minutes-1 hr to go through all the floors, with a nice video presentation at the",
          "One of my favorite Gaudi building. I'd recommend taking the guided tour (book beforehand) available in Spanish and English (and maybe other languages) so you understand the whole story of the family and Gaudi's designs for them in this building that's a \"palace\" (palau) but",
          "Love the place,design wood and marble ,the hole and The cellar of the house you can Enjoy the charming view from the rooftop, like it so much",
          "Overall, this is definitely worth a visit if you want a further insight into Gaud\u00ed\u2018 work, if that is the case, you can stop reading now. However... You are given an Audio device as standard to explain each room as you go along. However, these are not always helpful as some",
          "Paid visits to this amazing house in January and August of this year. I was surprised by the lack of crowds both times. The property is incredible and you get plenty of time to wander around and marvel at Gaudi's vision and incredible eye for detail. Make sure you go onto the",
          "a must see in Barcelona. A great neighborhood to spend the day or two walking enjoying the museums, restaurants, shops.",
          "We saw the entrance as we were walking the streets and got intrigued because we didnt know about this place, the ticket is not expensive (i believe it was 9\u20ac) and it is a gem!! Each room is more beautiful than the other, and all of the little things, like windows, chairs, and",
          "I was hesitate to go but I\u2019m glad that I did. Free information head sets are offered. Take them up on this as explanations are given for each room that you are in. Very fascinating architecture. Be sure to go up on the terrace.",
          "This is my favorite of all of Gaudi's work. Take your time and move through the palace there are so many little details. It's an impressive work of art.",
          "If you've seen other, more popular Gaudi buildings, you might be underwhelmed by this one. It is a 4 story house that has recently been restored and opened to the public for viewing. I was most impressed by the ceilings and the gold vault. The rooftop is nice and has the",
          "We chose the guided tour , it was amazing, tour guide very informative and passionate about the house, lovely views from roof Worth a visit. Amazing horse space in basement. Well keep building really worth the trip",
          "Our travel companion suggested we visit this palace and we found it to be incredibly interesting. Make time for it if you can!.",
          "Not crowed like the other Gaudi buildings and half the price of the others. However not less interesting to visit. At least one hour of audio guided tour. A must see.",
          "Ok so Sagrada may be the first port of call when you reach Barcelona, but booking rather expensive tickets on line, crowds for days all for an unfinished church might not be to everyone's liking. I'd recommend Palau Guell instead if you want to get a closer look at Gaudi's",
          "Palau Guell is only 2 minutes or so on foot from Barcelona Party Central (Pla\u00e7a Reial), but amazingly quiet and undervisited. Other Gaudi sites were mobbed, while here I was able to enjoy peace and quiet amd some sense of intimacy with this amazing building. The audio guide is",
          "Just of La Rambla this palace is well worth a couple of hours of your time. Only opened in 2011 after careful restoration this palace gives amazing insight into Gaudi\u2019s work, his relationship with Guell, the family life of the Guells and the craftsmanship of the day. The audio",
          "Go to Barcelona to see the gifts of Gaudi. Palau Guell is particularly lovely. We were working in Barcelona for 3 months when our grand daughter came to pick out a wedding dress at the flag ship store--and a beautiful dress it was! We decided to show her some of the astounding",
          "Closed for so many years, it is one of my favorite Gaudi's house. Audio guide is so informative. Do not miss the roof, and if you can do the night visit which includes a concert on the rooftop with a glass of cava (or 2)!",
          "After Casa Batllo and La Pedrera I visited this house and I was so surpriced. It costs only around 10\u20ac (students) so much less than other Gaud\u00ed\u2019s houses, it wasnt so busy, goes with audioguide and Gaud\u00ed showed again his perdect job with wood, stone and ceramics.",
          "This attraction is definitely worth a visit, the highlight for me being the colorfully decorated chimneys. But I found Casa Batlo a more fascinating stop on the Gaudi trail.",
          "I have been to almost all of Gaud\u00ed buildings, this is one of the cheaper ones and the most interesting one!",
          "We went late in the afternoon, close to closing time and there was no line and barely anyone inside. The interior is stunning and gives a good sense of Gaudi's early work and how it evolved over his all-too-short career. The roof is amazing.",
          "Just off the Rambla and a welcome respite from the heat. On 1st Sunday you get in for free instead of the usual \u20ac12 per person. Eclectic and a gentle introduction to Gaudi especially when compared to his later works. Delighted we chanced to see it and we were both delightfully",
          "We happened to wander by this site late one afternoon about an hour before they were closing. This is apparently a great time to go because there was no line and we didn't run into many people once inside. The architecture is stunning and it's fairly cool, making it a great way",
          "Amazing level of detail, many innovative touches, gives a feeling for Gaudi's career and Guell's life. In mid-June when we went it was not very crowded and there was no pressure to move through it quickly, so we enjoyed a slow and thorough appreciation. Not as unusual as",
          "We spotted this house from the street and thought it looked interesting..... It was well worth the visit and it was free on a Sunday! Well worth the visit if you like architecture and art.",
          "Extravagant palace for an industrialist and family with dramatic organs, acoustic halls and altars, not typical Gaud\u00ed, more renaissance with a Gaud\u00ed touch here and there, too much dark wood making it very serious and solemn, nice audio guide and helpful staff!",
          "This is an architectural gem that should not be missed. The entrance fee compared to the other buildings is reasonable. The whole building from the basement to the roof top chimneys need to be seen.",
          "We arrived at 2 pm. There was no line. This building is a gem. It shows what can be done when money is no problem and you have a friend who is a genius. I loved this.",
          "This small palace near the Ramblas is a brilliant example of the craftmanship of Gaudi. The building is elaborated in al it\u2019s details. The visitor can recognize many elements of Gaudi\u2019s exceptional syle.",
          "Really beautiful and impressive! It wasn't very busy when we visited on a friday. When you are fan of Gaudi, then it is a must-see: the rooms, ceilings, glass, lightfall in the house, rooftop and view above Barcelona, etcetera. But also gives an insight in some historic facts,",
          "If you are a fan of Gaudi and want to see a classic example of his early work without having to fight off hordes of other tourists to see it, then this place is for you. We visited late afternoon, and our little tour group of 8 practically had the building to ourselves! It's",
          "40 minute audio guide was very informative to another star attraction just off La Rambla. Beautifully restored building",
          "Strange and moody place, like a magic castle. Combines many architectural ideas that were fresh and modern at the time. It\u2019s not as crowded as Casa Mil\u00e0 or Casa Batll\u00f3, but still gives you an insight into Gaud\u00ed\u2019s style. Wait for the house organ playing every half hour.",
          "Unlike other Gaudi sites that are so very crowded, this beautiful stately home was not crowded at all. Lovely rooms and woodwork. Even the basement is interesting.",
          "You can reach Palau G\u00fcell by taking the metro to L3: Liceu and walking for 5 minutes. Do note that it is closed on Mondays. Admission is only half the price of Casa Mil\u00e0. Architecture lovers will get more out of these sights than we did.",
          "This was my first Gaudi house, and, as you know by now, also his first house. It was fascinating to see his work here just barely emerging from the Gothic styles of the 19th century. If someone told you it was a gothic residence, you'd probably say okay (ish) ... everything",
          "A must see for anyone visiting Barcelona - especially if you are a fan of Gaud\u00ed. This over the top designed home housed the Guell family and really shows off Gaud\u00ed love for intricate and interesting design. If you visit on a nice day and the roof top area is open, be sure to",
          "This is Gaudi\u2019s first major project, which is why it has plenty of square corners unlike his later works. Our guide was knowledgeable and completely charming. We spent about 2 hours there. 2 comments worth noting: -There are lots of stairs to climb (like in his other",
          "Fair price to enter with a fantatsic student discount. There is lots to see, and the statues and views on the roof are amazing. I would highly recommend it.",
          "A must for anyone with an interest in architecture and modern building design. No lines, no crowds-and be amazed. My teenager was glued to the audio guide, and said it was a top 2 thing to do in this town.",
          "Price wise, I think it was reasonable especially taking into account that the audioguide was free. It provided enough information we needed to understand Gaudi's work, from the background, idea, execution, function etc so we could understand it in a deeper and more meaningful",
          "We visited the Palau guell as is was situated across from the hotel we stayed in and We had a great view of the rooftop from Our terrace, the staff are really helpful and friendly, there is lift access to most areas of the museum, except the basement/stables and unfortunately",
          "Early work by Gaudi with elegance and beautiful marble and wood work. It displays grandeur, Gaudi's magnificent ceilings (always your eye is looking up) and well appointed with period furniture.",
          "This is another Gaudi masterpiece to see while in Barcelona! We went one morning and did not have to wait in line to see. The architecture is beautiful and a visit to the rooftop reveals a beautiful view of the city and the beautiful chimneys that are decorated with different",
          "We almost missed this incredible site as we were passing by on our way to La Rambla. Put it on your must see list.",
          "Admission fee, compared to other places-to-visit, is very reasonable. It lived up to its unique reputation of other-worldliness, with its colorful wistful-looking rooftop and one of the most amazing views of the Barcelona.",
          "Another great Gaudi milestone and not as crowded as his other landmarks in Barcelona. Definitely worth a visit if you love Gaudi.",
          "When we asked for directions to this location we were told it was at Parc Guell. It isn't! You need tickets in advance. Get them online. It is a mansion located on a side street off Las Ramblas, and not really easy to find. It is mind blowing how intricate and majestic it",
          "No, it\u2019s not the origin of the word Gaudy. But I can understand the confusion. The architecture was definitely interesting, especially some of the wooden coffered ceilings. The audio headsets were excellent and did a great job of describing the architectural points of",
          "Finally you can get tickets online and get into this place! On other visits we could never get in due to seemingly arbitrary hours based on when the staff was there. We ordered tickets on line ( just show the voucher on your phone\u2014no need to print despite what the website says)",
          "This is a Gaudi sight that might get overlooked, but I enjoyed the tour and seeing a different side of Gaudi. This is worth going to!",
          "Guadi at his best words realy cant describe this mans work it is just fantastic we visited all his buildings this time and would recommend you to do it",
          "This is another Gaudi masterpiece which is more like an open air museum. Intricate tiled designs are just marvelous. Surely worth a visit.",
          "A gem! There was no queue when I arrived mid-afternoon in May. The building is beautiful and inquiry-provoking. Several levels of unique architecture\u2014very interesting to look at.",
          "A Hidden Gem for ART NOUVEAU and architecture lovers, a place to visit once you are in Barcelona city center. It is not far from COLUMBUS MONUMENT",
          "The building (early Gaudi) is a hidden gem\u2014no lines or crowded rooms but every bit as special as his other works. The audio guide is full of interesting information about the house and family, though my device sometimes malfunctioned and reverted to the beginning or jumping",
          "We really enjoyed our visit there! It is a great place to take pictures since the architecture is so nice!",
          "Do not bother going to Casa Bitilo or Casa Mila Just go here ! It is a gem, undiscovered and the very best of Gaudi encapsulated in a small palace in a backstreet with stunning views from the rooftop !",
          "It\u2019s only \u20ac12 and 3 minutes off the ramblas; so it\u2019s worth an hour if you\u2019re in the area. You can see the signature of Gaudi in some of the design, but it\u2019s not developed throughout the house. This is grand living with incredible details throughout the place. It\u2019s designed as a",
          "This was our first Gaudi experience. Gaudi renovated this mansion owned by the Guell family. It's just crazy and beautiful. Use the audio tour, but take your time. Every floor and room has something special.",
          "We decided to visit one of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s earlier designs and we were not disappointed. You could see some elements that he introduced to later works but this palace, as all his work has individual characteristics. The quality of the materials used, and the workmanship is incredible.",
          "If staying at Le Meridien hotel, in the room is a card for \"Palau Guell\" that good for one admission so use it as a visit is worth it. Cost for a senior admission is nine euros. There is a free audio guide that is well done, easy to use and follow. Enjoy!",
          "Saw the brochure on Palau G\u00fcell from the Information booth and decided to give it a go. Entrance fee is $12, it include audio guide in English and a map of the Palace. The Palace is not crowded and if you want to take a rest from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla, go to Palau",
          "The Palau G\u00fcell is the townhouse Barcelona's starchitect Antoni Gaud\u00ed built for Catalan industrialist Eusebi G\u00fcell in the 1880s. With its sinuous shapes and tile mosaics, it is an example of Modernisme, the Catalan version of Art Nouveau, in general and Gaud\u00ed's personal style in",
          "Situated just off of Las Ramblas, this is another stunning example of Gaudi's vision, this being an earlier work. The audio guide allows you to tour at your own leisure and gives not only commentary but musical passages. At 12 euros entrance fee, it's cheaper than the other",
          "Great to walk around all the park, however this work is under major repair and reconstruction, so there are limited opportunities to see it in the proper condition or ambiance.",
          "this was my first introduction to Guadi' s work and I'm so pleased saw this house and the example of his early work and then seeing his progression of his later projects was incredible, what an amazing talented man. Great informative local guide really give context and fantastic",
          "I am recommending to book Gaudi tour and visit all of his creations. Gaudi was a genius. You can\u2019t see anything like this anywhere else in the world.",
          "Outstanding architecture, Gaudi's finest. Well worth the admission price to see his work, if you visit Barcelona this is a must see!",
          "If you are going to see both Palau Guell and Casa Batllo it is suggested to see Palau Guell first so you can see Gaudi's earlier work vrs later when things get brighter. This house was not as crowded as Casa Batllo. Buy your ticket online ahead of time.",
          "I actually enjoyed it far more (and spent far more time here) than the \u201csuperior\u201d Casa Batllo where the entrance fee (\u20ac12) is less than half the price of Casa Batllo (\u20ac28.50) \u2013 both designed by Gaudi and both include his famous chimneys. It was less crowded and more relaxed",
          "Highly original architecture and design details. Well worth an hour to visit. Includes a few items of original furniture, but mostly is the home itself on display.",
          "We took a walking tour that included this site. We didn't pay to go in, but our guide did a good job of giving us the history of the building. A must see for any Gaudi fan.",
          "Having arrived in Barcelona in the morning, we left the day free to explore on our own. Palau Guell was a short walk from our hotel, Le Meridien, and well worth spending the afternoon. This mansion was one of the first commissions Gaudi received in the beginning of his career.",
          "In one palace, I found the extreme amount of knowledge so vast and encompassing of the values of the times of the owners. I felt like I was walking back in time, understanding an outstanding family. Gaudi's contributions make this a show place for the future. His command of",
          "One of my favorite in Barcelona - big Palau with amazing pallet of materials and art. Colorful rooftop in a Gaud\u00ed style :) Be sure to go there when it\u2019s not raining! Otherwise you won\u2019t see the roof.",
          "As Gaud\u00ed's first project for the G\u00fcell family, this palace called PALAU G\u00fcell which is downtown, not far from the port and in a somewhat dodgy section of Raval--to the south of Las Ramblas-- hints at the outrageous designs that would later make him famous. It's lovely, and",
          "The complexity of the structure and quality of materials make this hugely impressive in terms its innovation and really portrays the abject luxury the family must have experienced.",
          "Right near Ramlas and the Barri Gthis is this Palace built for Guell. Again veyr different creation by Gaudy. Worth seeing it. It takes about 45 mins and quite expensive.",
          "This was Antoni Gaudi\u2019s first commission for a residence for the Guell family. It has been restored and a audio guide tour is provided that completely covers the home and how and why things were done in its construction. It is 1/2 block off of las ramblas. The audio tour takes",
          "Much different to Gaudi\u2019s other buildings, much darker, but really interesting. Well worth a visit, wasn\u2019t busy and we were able to go straight in.",
          "An amazing visit to a beautiful building. All the floors up to the rooftop were interesting and beautiful. A lot quieter than other places too so had time to take it all in.",
          "I absolutely LOVED rhe Palau Guell as did my husband! It has a really interesting interior, including furniture, as well as a fabulous rooftop - the chimeys are worth the visit and are so much more impressive than they appear from the street below. Some great views across the",
          "My second visit here and it still amazes. It's hard to know where to look first. What an imagination Gaudi had to build such a place. Give yourself enough time to see it all.",
          "We had just come from the Sagrada Familia, and were walking through Las Ramblas, on our way to Parc Guell, when this place popped up on our tourist app. As we were round the corner, we thought we'd give it a go. The Palau Guell was located off one of the side streets of Las",
          "I visited on a tour and we spent 1.5 hours but could have spent a lot longer so much to see. We did not get to see inside any of the individual property's you need to book these separately to entry fee. Make sure you go to the roof and the play room which looks like tunnels at",
          "Using the best materials, the architect has used his imagination to the limit without spending limits. And all that in a short limited space on the ground. One of the must see places. Worth paying the entry fee for all that you see and well explained in the audio guide.",
          "Probably 4th or 5th on the list of Gaudi's work you'd choose to see, but really well worth a look. Very different from most of his work and one of the few buildings he finished ! Good audio guide too, without being to detailed !",
          "If you are interested in Architecture at its quirky best, you must visit Palau Guell in the beautiful City of Barcelona. There are so many examples of the phenomenal works of Gaudi that a visit to this fabulous city would not be complete until you visit all of his attractions.",
          "Give a creative designer an unlimited budget and Palau Guell is the result. No expense has been spared in this creation. There is a free audio guide provided with the price of admission which is most helpful. You may happen to visit when someone is playing the organ, that was",
          "This house designed for the Guell family has so many interesting design elements . It's quite different than later buildings, so if you're a design or architecture fan you'll want to include this house in your Barcelona visit.",
          "Gaudi designed Palau Guell for his very wealthy best friend and benefactor Eusebi Guell who was married to the extremely wealthy Luisa Lopez. Both fathers of this couple, Joan Guell and Antonio Lopez, made their fortunes in the lucrative slave trade of Cuba during the 1800\u2019s.",
          "A really fabulous chance to tour a fascinating house. It is a wonderful place to learn about Gaudi as an architect, as a young architect. What you discover about his design inspirations will enhance visits to his other buildings, including La Sagrada Familia. Although obviously",
          "I have visited many private houses in the uk but this place was so unusual in its style. The details of the layout including the fabulous ceilings, windows and chimneys were all clearly explained and described using the electronic guides. It was well worth the entrance price.",
          "Great introduction to Gaudi as one of his earlier works. We surprisingly enjoyed this architectural landmark more than some of Gaudi's others. Wonderful audioguide tour, no need to prebook, just purchased tickets and walked right in. No crowds to fight, very pleasant and",
          "It was a lucky detour that brought us to Palau Guell. Friends have recommended this to us prior to arriving in Barcelona. Little did we know that it was just a few blocks away from our hotel in Las Ramblas. Palau Guell is an impressive piece of architecture despite its",
          "We had the good fortune to stay right across from this attraction, so couldn\u2019t resist a visit You can tour it in an hour but we took our time to take in all the unique architectural design, the incredible attention to detail and a rooftop visit at the end is exquisite Don\u2019t miss",
          "My wife and I were constantly amazed at the design and creativity of Gaudi. His work is phenomenal and I suppose a person could spend their whole life just studying his work. This building is apparently one that was finished in his lifetime which is remarkable. The detail",
          "Please please please if you love art, architecture, Gaud\u00ed... this is a must see and I\u2019d recommend seeing it before seeing the other Gaud\u00ed works as this was his first large scale commission. It is unbelievable, the limestone and marble work is second to none. You will not be",
          "I was somehow unaware of this building the first time we came to Barcelona years ago, so it was nice to be able to see it this time...if only from the outside... I am not sure if I have seen an entrance line that stretched so long to get inside! It will have to wait for another",
          "We decided to visit here due to inclement weather. But we are glad we did. Although the roof top was closed (rain) it was still worth a visit",
          "A fascinating 'palace' built by Gaudi for his friend & patron, Guell. So many interesting rooms to view and the selection of chimneys on the roof very imaginative. Great value for money.",
          "Not so many people know about this place, so it's not that crowded compared to the other Gaudi monuments. I recommend taking just an audioguide and descovering the place by yourself and at your own pace. Also you can buy tickets online so you skip the line. And make sure you",
          "Myself and a friend visited this castle in March - this was probably the least exciting place we visited all of the trip. The entry price, in my opinion, isn't worth what you get for it. The only plus was that our ticket included a free audio guide which we felt was very kind",
          "Situated off the main La Rambla this seems to be somewhat over looked by tourists so is quieter. A wonderful example of Gaudi's work with a very easy to use audio guide to listen to as you go around the 25 rooms",
          "You can spend as long here as you can in the Sagrada Familia - it goes on and on, up and around, each room bursting with gorgeous style and superb craftsmanship. Had the free audio guide device but never seem to master these, missing rooms and numbers etc, but I'm sure you could",
          "This is an incredible opportunity to see one of the most unique sites you will ever visit. If you only watch the children to see the excitement it is worth the visit but you will simply be amazed.",

          "This Gaudis work is not as well known as Casa Battlo or Casa Mia but it is worth visitting. You learn a lot from the headphones you get for free and the the roof-top with its chimneys and the view are not to be missed. Plan at least an hour.",
          "We arrived at 11am, got the tickets and just waited 5mins to enter. The house is just amazing, with Gaud\u00ed\u2019s touch in ever room you step in. Very useful to have the audio guide- and it\u2019s free ! Really a must see in Barcelona",
          "Buy tickets a couple of doors before the house, security checks on entry. Staff all very pleasant, good audio guide with some photos to illustrate on the screen. The main room with organ, piano etc is impressive, the few items of furniture are real Art Deco classics, Gaudi's",
          "Beautiful house, very well worth a visit. The house is very well restored with lot's of authentic furniture. Unfortunately the roof was closed when I visited due to rain and the danger of a slippery roof.",
          "It is great to see this building in comparison to some of Gaud\u00ed's later structures. You really get to see how some of his ideas began. This building seems less modern/more traditional, but somehow more grand, and the little details are fascinating. This is one structure that",
          "With the exception of the Basilica Familia, this is our favourite Gaudi building and surprising one of his earliest. Just so interesting",
          "right from the get go, you know this place was way ahead of its time. the palace was designed to absorb carriages and horses, had a legit basement to hold them, and help with the transfer of air through out the building. the prayer room or gallery is the nicest of all the",

          "We went on a tour which reviewed much of the interesting developmental history. The engineering is like non other, so far ahead of its time. It has wonderful perspective overlooking the city. The whimsical homes and creative features are a marvel.",
          "If you are interested in the Catalan modernista architecture and Gaudi's works, you should visit Palau Guell to get to know one of his earlier works, how he experimented his ideas/techniques (which culminated in the design of Sagrada Familia), and his relationship with Eusebi",

          "It is a great place to visit if you wanna know more about the Guells family and to admire Gaudis works. The audioguide is worth.",
          "This was a beautiful palace by Gaudi. There are so many unique decisions and designs that made it so famous. Audio tour was great for you to learn details.",
          "This is another wonderful master piece by Gaudi. However is way cheaper than the rest and less crowded.",
          "Many of the Gaudi architectural masterpieces are expensive to visit and crowded. This is one of the better deals, 12 euros, with a 25% discount for holders of the Ruta del Modernismo guide. On a winter day it was not too busy, once we let the large Japanese tour group play",
          "Well worth a look this one, more than Casa Battlo in my opinion. Audio guide very informative and we spent longer here than in Battlo. Although commissioned for someone else you can still see his design within this marvellous building. We didn\u2019t need to pre book. Reasonable",
          "We toured this amazing Gaud\u00ed designed home for G\u00fcell family. There are audio guide included. Beautiful interior details that words can not describe. There are lots of easy stairs Worth the visit",
          "We had a free morning on our final day before going to the airport, and we were staying in the Gothic district near Las Rambles, so we made this our final Gaudi building tour. Very worthwhile, and one of the Gaudi sites you should visit. And it is convenient to Las Rambles, if",
          "I almost didn't go - but glad I did. A real palace. Exquisite. Worth a few bucks and an hour of your time. Conveniently located next to the Ramblas.",
          "In my opinion this is one of the best houses for architecture in Barcelona and I would strongly recommend a visit. The audio tour is very informative. This is a must-see",
          "Wow! Another masterpiece by Gaudi! We booked a tour of this beautiful mansion. It took us about two hours. There is so much to admire and see in this house that two hours is hardly enough to do so. Gaudi was indeed a genius in design. He was such an extraordinary designer and",
          "I nearly didn\u2019t see this place because everyone suggested La Pedrera was better. Heck no. You want to see creativity and opulence, along with Gaudi \u2018s magnificent architecture and furniture- come here. I was blown away with how beautiful this place is. I also like old places and",
          "As an admirer in architecture, this was by far the most valuable monument I visited during my 3 days short stay in Barcelona. This is one of the most first original works by the renowned architect Antoni Gaudi. As opposed to the other places of attractions, the visitors get to",
          "We absolutely loved Gaud\u00ed's Casa Battl\u00f3, and even wanted to return a second time. But Palau G\u00fcell: boring. We just walked through, and got tired of listening to the audio tour. Why? Because Gaud\u00ed was working within the confines of Victorian architecture and design. So",
          "This house is different to many other Gaudi buildings , and all the more fascinating. Very high ceilings, dark in some rooms , certainly not a cozy home ! But yet another Gaudi masterpiece that seems not so well known .",
          "Worth seeing on last days in Barcelona. Not the most amazing architecture but still worth visiting. Located in the center, eassy access.",
          "Stayed one week in Barcelona and visited four casa last November. Palau Guell is the only unforgettable one for me. From the basement to the roof, we can see how thoughtful Gaudi was to design every piece of this ideal house for Mr. Guell. Our private guide walked through the",

          "Such a wonderful house, and not many visitors because everyone heads over to Casa Battlo or la Pedera instead. Definitely see this house, it is completely different as it was designed when Gaudi was just starting out at 33. It is a more earthy, more natural design, and (as",
          "Not only did Gaudi's vision remain spectacular after visiting 3 other of his monuments but the craftsmanship (especially the metalwork) is beautiful to see.",
          "Definitely worth the trip as the architecture and the detail is fabulous. It is busy even though we we ot there in peak season. It puts most modern architects to shame.",
          "A very interesting self guided tour of this Gaud\u00ed \u201ccastle\u201d. It was not quite as crowded as some of the others so you can appreciate the space with more peace. The tour goes up to the rooftop",
          "This is a most interesting perspective of Gaudi\u2019s work. Shows what he can do to a residence. This is good value for money as it costs half the price of the Casa Batllo and is as interesting. You get a free audio guide. There are good views from the roof. Don\u2019t forget to go down",
          "Possibly not as grand as Casa Batlo but nowhere near as crowded. Only 75 yards off the ramblas. Just turned up on the day an was in within 5 mins. Loaded with plenty of quirky Gaudi architecture and the chimneys on the roof are exceptional. If your into Gaudi don't miss this.",
          "Beautiful, from a \"bygone era\", when wealthy art patrons supported the work of architects and artists. The self-guided tour brings it all alive. Make a reservation and plan on a 1 to 2 hours.",
          "Do not let the look outside deceive you. This is place is definitely worth a visit as it shows off Gaudi's gift in design. Well worth the visit.",
          "Visited this Palau about 10 years ago before it was fully renovated and I was really delighted to see it now in its full glory. Just a stunning building. If you are a Gaudi fan this is one of his (many in Barcelona) must visit buildings. Lovely visit and well presented.",
          "This palace was closed for renovations for many years and just recently reopened to the public. Although it's just off Las Ramblas, it really is off the tourist path and well worth a visit. Make sure to get a headset and do a self-guided tour to get all of the details of this",
          "It is not as well known as the Casa Mil\u00e0, or the Casa Batll\u00f3 or the Sagrada Familia, but it is a very beautiful site to visit, bearing in mind it was designed for one family as a residence. Really spectacular.",
          "A cultural visit to Palau Guell, an other architecture work of Antoni Gaudi (100 yeras ago) really different look this mansion, a llitle bit dark, but also today dark is sometimes modern, and Gaudi was still at this time (1888) the greatest at his beginning. A great place to",
          "A lovely mansion designed by Antoni Gaudi. It has a slightly different look compared to his other designs such as Casa Mila.",
          "I had walked by this place once again but I had the fortune of visiting a day without too many fellow tourists and therefore had time to look at all the small details in this awesome house. Just imagining the thoughts and the efforts in building this remarkable house is mind",
          "We went here after seeing St Pau Recinte Modernista on the same day. It was interesting to see the bright, airy architecture of Gaudi\u2019s teacher, followed by the darker, but equally impressive workof Gaudi himself at Palau Guell (pronounced \u201cgwaay\u201d apparently).",
          "What an amazing house! If you can only visit one of the houses that Gaudi designed, this should be the one. It is better than Casa Batllo and Casa Vicens and cheaper at only \u20ac12. I arrived at 11.00am and found no lines outside, so entry was easy. Whilst there were visitors",
          "Palau Guell was overall a bit creepy for my liking. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t like it, it just really creeped me out haha. I agree that it\u2019s architectural design is phenomenal and that it\u2019s amazing for its era, but it was dark all the way through and it felt like I was walking",
          "A reinterpretation of a medieval castle in the spirit of Art Nouveau, this house renders you speechless by its ingenuity! A world class monument, it is oddly enough not on the beaten track and can be enjoyed in peace and quiet.",
          "Tucked away unobtrusively on a side street just off La Rambla, the gothic exterior is unremarkable, but once inside, the building is truly spectacular. Commissioned by industrialist Eusebi Guell when Gaudi was just 33 years old, it is one of his earliest works, but you can",
          "It would have been nice to see the inside and especially the roof top fixtures that Gaudi put in place. I think that there is a day that the tour is free.",

          "Fantastic collaboration between the young Gaudi and the industrialist Guell. Lots of hints to the Gothic and to the Orient. The roof terrace is not as spectacular as the roof of Casa Mila, but contains the first elements of his further development. The audio guide gives a lot of",
          "I visited this today (December 20) no line, just walked up and bought my ticket and walked on in. The palace is remarkable, Gaudi certainly did some fine work here, The downstairs stable area was closed today. Moving upstairs and seeing the construction and design, I was",

          "This multi level palace is simply amazing no detail left un attended. Tour was self guided and nicely set up with various language hand held devices and map.",
          "We were lucky that day as when we arrived to buy the tickets, the keeper told us there are free tickets to be given out. So just 20min if waiting and we went into this masterpiece free. The best thing is they provide self-help information handheld device. My Teenagers simply",
          "Worth paying entry just for the view itself. The palace is beautiful - a bit dark but still amazing. The architecture is exquisite and was a great stop out of the sun. You get an audio guide included in entry. Which for actually very interesting and explained features",
          "An unexpected building just by the Ramblas. Really interesting to understand the work of Gaud\u00ed and the view from the rooftop with its colorful chimneys is stunning! If you are planning on visiting several Gaud\u00ed buildings, start by this one to follow the chronology and get a",
          "There are long lines waiting to get into the Palau. Another one of Gaudi's finest works. This museum is very easy to find and it is in one of the main shopping areas of Barcelona.",
          "I visited the Palace with my parents and we all found the architecture and overall experience very interesting and enjoyable. Less crowded and more intimate than for example Casa Mila (which was somewhat difficult to enjoy due to number of people). If you have a limited budget",
          "This is the most amazing home that I have seen designed by Gaudi. Guell wanted a mansion where he could entertain and this is what you see with amazing detail to both design and decoration but to function as well. The signature is the Great Hall which is simply amazing,",

          "This is the house Gaudi designed for his friend and industrialist Guell. It is easy to find off the Ramblas close to the theater. Interesting and all the elements Gaudi incorporated in later works. When we visited, someone was playing the organ which added to the experience.",
          "I enjoy visiting buildings by Gaudi and his contemporaries, but somehow had never found the time to visit this one which, from its rather dour and forbidding exterior looks like an early outlier in the maestro's work. The audio tour is detailed and informative and - starting",
          "We were not planning on visiting it but when we saw it from the entrance we decided to go in. It is a very nice little palace that shows Gaud\u00ed style, not only as an architect but also as a furniture designer and iron sculpture artisan. There is a chapel inside the building and",
          "I bought 2 tickets for my husband and myself to visit this attraction on the last morning we had in Barcelona, a Monday, via cell phone online a few days beforehand. Well it turns out that this is closed on Mondays. Instead of the mobile site informing me that tickets weren't",
          "My wife and I have visited Barcelona many times and have visited all the main Gaudi buildings and parks. This was one we had left off the list not deliberately but an oversight. So on a recent trip we decided to correct that. Our first attempt, on a Monday, failed because it as",

          "The detail and use of materials is a sight to see. You are given free roam of most of the palace. The audio is a must to understand what you're seeing. Take your time to really enjoy the craftsmanship. The roof top is fun spot compared to the other styles of the palace. We went",
          "When in Barcelona don\u2019t miss Palau Guell. This city is full of art and architecture- plan to spend time view as much as you can.",

Much less crowded then the other more popular attractions and inexpensive to get in at \u20ac12. Our visit lasted about an hour with a provided audio guide. If you appreciate",
          "In my opinion Palau Guell is even better than La Pedrera (although not as good as casa Battl\u00f3) and so much cheaper than both of them. It has an unique interior and also a terrace with some of his signature chimneys.",
          "Unique style building designed by young Gaudi. Every room is different and none less mesmerising. Audioguide is included in price. Don't skip it when visiting Barcelona!",

          "Just wonderful Guell Palace in Barcelona, just off the Ramblas. They keep the guest total to a certain number through out the day, so you may not get in the time you wish. But worth the wait, because the crowd number is restricted, you can slowly and calmly without a ton of",
          "It is quite okay, but you will have ~24 audio guide recordings about it and that was too long in my opinion... For example you can see around in each room in several seconds and still you have to remain there for a few minutes, if you want to hear the recording until it's end",

          "3.5 stars\nThe site is well curated through the audioguide. Thought the price was a bit high for that format but it is detailed and without feeling long. It's divided into sections and the rooms are numbered accordingly but it was a bit \u2026",
          "Recommended place to visit, going through the whole Palace, you could see how meticulous Gaudi was in designing this place. Go all the way to the roof and be amazed.",
          "Actually worth the entry. Free audio guides, student discounts, not as expensive as other Gaudi buildings",
          "Beautiful architecture and the various forms is amazing .. will throughly recommend this",
          "Absolutely beautiful architecture and design! It was amazing to see some of Gaudi's first designs and work here before seeing his later works in the Eixample. Reasonably priced and comes with included audioguide.",

          "Wonderful interior. I liked this place more than casa batllo. Can see Gaudi has talent",
          "It's absolutely beautiful. The wood work, the wrought iron workmanship is unbelievable. The pillars design in the old Stables under the Palace and the way the stalls worked with them. The stain glass, wrought iron workmanship and shutter \u2026",
          "A must see in Barcelona, the best and cheapest option if you want to visit a Gaudi building.",
          "When visiting G\u00fcell Palace the connection between Gaudi and Guell will finally be revealed if u did not read up on it.\n\nGaudi designed the G\u00fcell Palace for his friend and with limited space the interior was planned with a lot of though put \u2026",
          "Interesting place with a fair self-led tour. The layout can be a bit confusing and there are a good amount of stairs, so it isn't great for anyone with physical limitations.",

          "Filled with stories. I love this place",
          "Are you visiting Barcelona? If yes, you should not dare leaving this city before enjoying a visit this place. The most iconic architecture representing Barcelona is placed in this building. The best is that you could visit it for free. Just \u2026",
          "We spent a few days in Barcelona and visited a number of all the sights that are there.  Guell Palace is one of Antoni Gaudi's works, the building is on a narrow side street and you do not see up to the roof from the street.  The facade facing the street is interesting.  Many visitors and queues if you want to enter the building.",
          "Great hotel that is centrally located. Has a great rooftop bar and view. The breakfast buffet is included and fabulous! The staff are helpful and friendly. Recommend!!!",
          "It's just over the top. The details throughout the home are stunning. Buy your tickets online in advance. I recommend going before noon. It won't be as crowded.",
          "A \u201cmust see\u201d for Gaudi fans. The best example of his use of local materials and ironwork. The rooftop chimneys really show off how inventive Gaudi was and the stables are not to be missed. The use of common space for multiple purposes and \u2026",
          "Must see this place, one of gaudis best",
          "Not as spectacular from outside as the Casa Mila or the Casa Batllo, but the inside interior is amazing. Worth the price of the ticket, it cost 12\u20ac (Casa Mila and the Batllo cost 25\u20ac)",
          "Awesome tour. Amazing insight. If air conditioning was developed during Gaud\u00ed's time, he'd have built the most comfortable palaces, on top of the most beautiful palaces.",
          "Well done free audio guide and the palace is of course fantastic if you can enjoy important historical architecture",
          "Natural weather structures incorporated in the the building ...I wish all architects can be more conscious of areas weather patterns.Rain water catchment area.",
          "Not as well known about as his other projects.  Tck \u20ac12 hardly any tourist when we visited which was super.! I was Able to take photos. Chilled Cafe in the garden.. Gaudis 1st commision interesting mix in this house. Loved it and highly recommend to others to visit",

          "Totally mind-blowing . The details are amazing. The way the light filters in is beautiful. I cannot imagine how Gaudi managed to conceive of all that, in that time. \nAudio guide was free , and extremely informative. \nIt seems that they play \u2026",
          "Interesting place to see early gaudi\u2019s work as an architect. However if short trip not a must.",
          "Went here a number of years ago. It wasn't partially busy compared to other places we went to. The roof is well worth a visit and you get a fantastic view of the city.",
          "Fantastic experience. Was the first gaudi building we went to. This and casa battlo were fantastic. Good that audio guide was included. I would spend 1.5 hrs here.",
          "Nice audio guide that takes you around the palace. It's very bare with minimal furniture inside so not as grand as other palaces I've visited. However, this one is obviously showcasing the architecture more anyway.",
          "Beautiful architecture and surrounded by a park",
          "One of Barcelona's must-see sights. You won't be disappointed by Gaudi's vision and style.",

          "A must to see. Every room has its own story. Audio guide is included",
          "Splendid architecture by Antonio Gaudi. One of the first of his works. A lot of chambers open for the public. Nice view from the rooftop. My favourites were the piano room, the billiards room and the organ room.",
          "I've been a fan of Gaudi's work for a long time now.  This house is quite special, the attention to detail is phenomenal,  even things that wouldn't be seen by but a few people are turned into a thing of beauty... I mean,  who decorates their chimney pots with a ceramic mosaic !?",
          "Meh. Not worth the ticket price. Might be sufficient to view the architecture from the outside.",

          "Impressive architecture with basement stable to main floor concert hall to rooftop extravaganza.",
          "Very nice modernist palace on an otherwise unremarcable small street. Is very close to teh Rambla, very nice interiors, fancy woodwork ceilings, lots of furniture preserved. Ticket comes with a free audio guide to have a better idea what you are looking at. You also get access to the roof, which contains interesting tiled chimneys.",
          "Interesting place. It's possible to visit the roof, beautiful view. The palace looks empty inside, almost no furniture. Every 30 minutes live organ music. Audio tour is included in price. Lots of stairs.",
          "Worth every single \u20ac. Stunning experience.\nTaste the wealthness of the family Guell.\nPerfect and very interesting audio tour.\nDo not forget to listen to ' 'Sad Song', composed by Isabel Guell. Beautiful.",

          "Fans of Gaudi will love this place. If you are looking for a short, interesting tour of one of Gaudi's early projects, this is a great place to go. I had a little trouble with the audio tour, and was disappointed that several large areas \u2026",
          "Great place to visit. It is majestic inside. Definitely one of my favorites in Barcelona. A lot of different styles and each room has its personality. It is close to la Boqueria so I would recommend to add this to your list.",
          "More impressive than it looks like from the outside",
          "Beautiful house. Entry includes a great audioguide where they explain lots of great details on how the house was designed by Gaud\u00ed and how it was used in everyday life. The details in the stone, woodwork, and beautiful roof chimneys are stunning.",
          "Definitely the place to go if you are in Barcelona. Amazing interiors, and the organ built specially for that house. Colorful mosaic chimneys on the roof.",
          "Pretty decent value for money (12 euros) considering you get a free audio guide. We didn't buy tickets in advance and there was no line for either the ticket office or the palace itself, nor were there a lot of people inside the palace. This was about 5pm on Saturday. The roof terrace was the highlight.",
          "Fantastic Plaza with historic architecture and of course the Star Gaudi, right outside. The plaza is filled with palm trees, statues, restaurants, Cafe's, and shops. Standing inside is a great experience of the combination of its \u2026",

          "Definitely worth the visit. This palace is so beautiful and unique.",
          "The architecture in this palace is truly amazing. I have never seen anything like it. It is worth the fee of entry. Gaudi is an artist with great taste. I was blown by the amount of details, and with a little bit of imagination, you can see how the Guell family used to live there. Loved it!",
          "One of my favorite Gaudi places to visit in the city, second only to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, great audio guide, convenient location right off La Rambles! Amazing roof top too!",

          "I enjoyed Guell Palace! An audio headset was provided with the ticket, which helped to gain historical context and more information about the architecture. I recommend visiting if you are in Barcelona. My only concern is that it can be a little difficult to navigate.",

          "Well worth a visit. Detail worth seeing. Reasonable value",

          "I only saw this from the outside briefly after taking a short detour off La Rambla but it's another good example of Gaudi's work and is worth a visit. As most attractions are quite pricey in the city I opted not to go in on this occasion \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to visit. A must for people visiting the area.",
          "Beautiful place with unique design. \n\nDoesn't take too long to wonder round. Would advise listening to the audio to give you a greater insight of what's going on in each room. \n\n*They do shut the roof off if it rains.",

          "Like any other Gaud\u00ed building, beautiful, fun, interesting, fascinating, historic, nice staff, long queue. I recommend it if you have enough time for your Barcelona trip, other Gaud\u00ed\u2019s may me much more interesting. This visit takes around 90-100 minutes and the queue more or it depends.",

          "Personally I think this is one of the best of Gaudi's building's. The main hall ceiling is astonishing. I was lucky enough to go when not so busy so was able to lay on the floor and take it all in.",

          "Not as expensive as the other Gaud\u00ed structures to view, but also not the same experience. Though his work is still very beautiful and detailed, it\u2019s not nearly as unique as his other buildings. I do still recommend going, but keep in mind \u2026",

          "Lively place. One of Gaudi destinations",
          "Fantastic place to visit! The building was designed by Gaud\u00ed, but it somehow feels so much different from his other work: it's a lot darker, more serious in a way. But that only makes it more interesting! The woodwork all over the building \u2026",
          "Palau Guell is amazing!! You get to see 95% of the property.  The price of the tour is \u20ac12 and includes the audio guide.  On the first Sunday of the month is free.

          "Nice architecture, but in my humble option, letting people wait from 30 min to a hour to let them in - isn't the best idea.\nThey let in groups of 400 people every half of hour, and you have to stay another half of hour to buy a ticket.\nI \u2026",
          "Intriguing structure, worth visiting. Nearby area not very appealing.",
          "IT'S WORTH TO GO INSIDE. Tickets could be cheaper but we at the same time its kid of worldwide and unique attraction. Takes around 45minutes and its fully described via audioguide. The best part of the building is on the roof. Go late, ideally before closing or book online.",

          "Very beautiful and educational but had a unnecessary amount of content in the audio guide",
          "The exorbitant luxury will poke your eyes out. Every room is a juwel and Gaudi certainly put in all his effort. The free audio tour is a must have to understand daily life and how the building around it was constructed. Situated just off the ramblas. You should really take your time here. No quick visits!",

          "Super nice! Recommended to go, not so expensive",
          "This home is stunning and I think travel guides and books grossly underrate how incredible this home truly is. I loved wandering around this palace understanding what Gaudi meant to the Guell family and what inspired every single one of his choices in design and decor!!",
          "Last entry is about 70 minutes before closing.",
          "A building designed by Gaudi, well kept and the audio guide that is available in many languages was a great way to hear about the history of the palace and Gaudi.",

          "Cool park but some parts, you gotta pay. Crowdy and touristy too. Interesting things to see though but not alot unless u pay to enter. You can still walk around the park, have a picnic, climb to the hill where the cross is, or smoke a joint on higher lands.",
          "Nice and interesting architecture",
          "Compared to La Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo, Palau Guell seems to be relatively less known, but I really like the fine, gorgeous details and decoration inside the building. It's not a huge spot but it is definitely worth to go!!",

          "We spontaneously decided to visit Palau G\u00fcell due to some changes. It was totally worth it! We went in the late afternoon and enjoyed the sunset in the end on the rooftop. There was no queue, so we purchased the tickets, entered immediately \u2026",
          "Another super creation of Mr Gaudi",

          "Always interesting to see how people lived in the past. Roof view is great.",
          "I think it is Gaudi's most interesting work. The most impressive is the interior architecture and, above all, the high-rise central hall. It is good to buy tickets online, as there is a maximum number of tourists per hour.",
          "Recently renovated early Gaudi building. Less busy thay others and well worth a visit. Roof access is possible",

          "It's definitely worth seeing Gaudi's interior decoration style, he combines wood and steel in the most creative way. The palace has around 4 floors and the roof, so it takes just over an hour to go though it without stopping. The audioguide \u2026",

          "Just make sure you go inside! Only 12 euros for as long as you want to look. Audio guides included in several languages. This will blow you away. Magnificent. You will probably spend 3 hours here and take a hundred photos or more. Recommend \u2026",

          "Although it's not that famous, we really enjoyed our visit. It was very interesting and we can say that it was like an introduction to his way of thinking. It was our first visit to Gaudi's work by that time and it really helped us to understand his whole work.",

          "Great Gaudi architecture. Reasonable entrance fee.",
          "Beautiful house! Worth a visit.",
          "Amazing house to be able to tour! Free on the first Sunday of the month but have to go pick up tickets (for a later entry time depending on how far back in line you are) at 10am or 3pm.",
          "Fantastic place to visit, amazing relics, site seeing Memories for your photo album.",
          "Gorgeous interior, not too busy when i visited.",
          "This is probably the best Art Nouveau building in Barcelona. It has a medieval look and it\u2019s a real hidden gem. A Must!",
          "beautiful architecture.   very interesting history with a great audio tour",
          "Well worth a vist",
          "I enjoyed this Gaudi designed architecture the most",
          "I learned about Gaud\u00ed and all when I was a school kid and this was just like a dream :D So exciting!!!",
          "It's A Must Visit place!",
          "Another great part of Barcelona",
          "Interesting tour to watch amazing work of Gaudi. I personally liked views from roof terrace and listening of organ music in the main hall.",
          "Beautiful places to visit",
          "Amazing place, hidden beauty everywhere you look. Take your time observing.",
          "One of the highlights of my Barcelona trip.  I loved the vibe I got the moment I walked into this place.",
          "What\u2019s not to like about this fantastic place? Guell architecture . . . Make sure you visit the rooftop.",
          "This the most spectacular single owner house built by Antoni Gaud\u00ed. It is an outstanding place inscribed in the World Heritage List since 1984. It is totally worthy. ",
          "Incredible insights on the life of the G\u00fcell family and their relationship with Gaudi. A hidden treasure in the midst of Barcelona.",
          "Perfect place for everytging. You can have a good look over tge city, take some good photos, hike. You should buy tickets online if you want to go inside",
          "Very impressive design and coordination of different attributes  to create the perfect living and hosting house for Guell",
          "Wouldn't say it's a must visit, but it's nice to see - basically a park, with some unique architectural solutions and details, in the style of Gaudi, Of course. The biggest attraction is right at the entrance, the two houses, the gecko, and the columns/marketplace.",
          "An incredible house! A bit pricey to see but truly special experience of Gaud\u00ed. Loved the horse stables and the roof especially!",
          "Really interesting Gaudi designed building if that's what you're in Barcelona for.",
          "Beautiful! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Very fascinating home.",
          "It was impressive for sure but really just a big empty house. If you're really into architecture and design then this is for you! But otherwise it's overpriced for what it is (12 euro pp). The most interesting part was the short film about Guell's life. ",
          "Nice place, especially the park is amazing",
          "Beautiful place, interesting designs everywhere",

          "You can not describe something so majestic! you have to be lost in the palace to feel the atmosphere.",
          "Beautiful building. Gaudi himself.",
          "I have been to Palau Guell. Specially came a second time during my recent trip with my mom who loves architecture. It was really special to see the early work of Gaudi. So much thought goes into every step he makes and I especially love how \u2026",
          "Guell's family home designed by Gaud\u00ed. As you would expect it is a tremendous work of art which encompasses many different architectural styles. However, all styles are in such a harmony that it transforms this palace into a unique location for such a well known and rich family of Barcelona.",
          "Great place for stunning photo shoot, very informative and friendly staff too.",
          "Amazing and beautiful like every work of Gaudi with a good audioguide. But I (this is only my impress) love better Casa Battl\u00f3.",
          "Another fabulous and  creative work by Gaudi. This is one of his earlier works. Beautiful home of the G\u00fcell Family.  While I liked my visits to the Gaudi apartments more,  this place is well worth the visit",
          "Very beautiful. A must stop if you are in Barcelona.",
          "This Gaudi masterpiece showcased music. The central salon housed an organ and the music can be heard through out the house as the design provided perfect accoustics. As with all of Gaudi's work, the detail is immense. In the basement a unicorn tethering post for horses remain. On our visit it was less crowded than casa Battlo.",
          "Lovely gardens in true Gaudi style. We'll worth visiting but do choose your time of day wisely as the heat of summer could spoil the experience. ",

          "One of the amazing buildings of Gaudi",

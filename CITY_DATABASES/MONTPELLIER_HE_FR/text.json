        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Montpellier's main railway station is Saint-Roch. There are plans to construct a high-speed railway linking N\u00eemes and Montpellier with the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.\n\nThe Montpellier \u2013 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Airport is located in the area of Fr\u00e9jorgues, in the town of Mauguio, southeast of Montpellier.\nThe Transports de l'agglom\u00e9ration de Montpellier (TaM) manages the city's public transportation, including its 56-kilometre (35 mi) tramway network consisting of four lines and several parking facilities. Line 1 runs from Mosson in the west to Odysseum in the east. Line 2 runs from Jacou in the northeast to St. Jean-de-Vedas in the southwest. Line 3 and Line 4 opened in April 2012. Line 3, which is 22.4-kilometre (13.9 mi) long, links Juvignac and Perols with a branch to Lattes and serves 32 stations. Line 4 circles the centre and serves as a connector line between the various arms of tram system. They intersect at Gare St. Roch station, Rives du Lez and Corum.\nThe TaM also manages the large bike sharing scheme V\u00e9lomagg', started in June 2007, comprising 1200 bicycles and 50 stations.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMontpellier was the finish of Stage 11 and the departure of Stage 12 in the 2007 Tour de France.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

It was sometimes architecturally isolated but usually was built to span either a street or a roadway, preferably one used for triumphal processions.Arc de Triomphe and Place Charles de GaulleThe Arc de Triomphe and the Place Charles de Gaulle, Paris.\u00a9 Beijing Hetuchuangyi Images Co., Ltd./Dreamstime.comAlthough associated with ancient Roman architecture, the origins and significance of the triumphal arch are still not fully understood. It was a separate structure, having no connection with city gates or city walls, and should not be confused with the Porta Triumphalis, through which the victorious Roman army had to pass before entering the sacred city territory (pomerium) of Rome. Its basic form consisted of two piers connected by an arch and crowned by a superstructure, or attica, that served as a base for statues and bore commemorative inscriptions. In early arches the attic statuary usually represented the victor in his triumphal chariot; in later ones only the emperor was depicted. The function of the arch, therefore, seems to have been that of an honorary monument of unusual importance; it was so interpreted by the only ancient author who discussed it, Pliny the Elder (ad 23\u201379).Few triumphal arches are known from the time of the republic. In Rome three were erected: the first, in 196 bc, by Lucius Stertinius; the second, in 190 bc, by Scipio Africanus the Elder on the Capitoline Hill; and the third, in 121 bc, the first in the Forum area, by Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus. All carried statuary, but little is known of their architectural form, and there are no remains.Most of the triumphal arches were built during the empire period (27 bc to ad 476). Early in the 4th century ad, for example, there were 36 such monuments in Rome. The imperial-style structure was sometimes expanded to three arches with the central arch reaching a greater height than the two side arches. The triumphal arch of the empire was articulated by a facade of marble columns; ornamental cornices were added to the piers and attics, and the archway and sides were adorned with relief sculpture depicting the emperor\u2019s victories and achievements.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nIn Rome three triumphal arches have survived: the Arch of Titus (ad 81), with relief sculpture of his triumph over Jerusalem; the Arch of Septimius Severus (203\u2013205), commemorating his victory over the Parthians; and the Arch of Constantine (312), a composite product, decorated with reused material from the times of Domitian, Trajan, and Hadrian. Outside Rome, notable ancient examples include the arches of Augustus in Susa, Aosta, Rimini, and Pola; the arches of Trajan in Ancona and Benevento; the arch of Marcus Aurelius in Tripoli; and that of Septimius Severus in Leptis Magna, in North Africa.Constantine, Arch ofThe Arch of Constantine, Rome.\u00a9 Jeff Banke/Shutterstock.comIts forms have reappeared, imaginatively transposed, in the facades and interiors of churches, such as that of San Andrea in Mantua, Italy (begun 1472), by Leon Battista Alberti, and even in fountain design, as at the Trevi Fountain in Rome (begun 1732), by Niccol\u00f2 Salvi.Trevi Fountain, Rome; designed by Nicola Salvi, 18th century.Pixland/JupiterimagesAmong the triumphal arches built since the Renaissance, noteworthy examples include the triumphal arch of Alfonso I (1453\u201370) in Naples; the 17th-century Porte Saint-Denis and Porte Saint-Martin and Jean Chalgrin\u2019s Arc de Triomphe (1836), all in Paris; London\u2019s Marble Arch, by John Nash, and the Hyde Park Corner Arch, both designed in 1828; and Stanford White\u2019s Washington Square Arch (completed 1895) in New York City.Nash, John: Marble ArchMarble Arch in Hyde Park, London; designed by John Nash.\u00a9 Anton Balazh/FotoliaNew Delhi: All India War Memorial archAll India War Memorial arch (1931; commonly called India Gate), New Delhi; designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.Larry Johnson (CC-BY-2.0) (A Britannica Publishing Partner) ",

        "wiki": "The Mus\u00e9e Fabre is a museum in the southern French city of Montpellier, capital of the H\u00e9rault d\u00e9partement.\nThe museum was founded by Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Fabre, a Montpellier painter, in 1825. Beginning in 2003, the museum underwent a 61.2 million euro renovation, which was completed in January 2007. It is one of the main sights of Montpellier and close to the city's main square, the Place de la Com\u00e9die. The museum's national importance is recognised by it being classified as a Mus\u00e9e de France by the Ministry of Culture (France).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe town of Montpellier was given thirty paintings in 1802 which formed the basis of a modest municipal museum under the Empire, moving between various temporary sites. In 1825, the town council accepted a large donation of works from Fabre and the museum was installed in the refurbished H\u00f4tel de Massillian, officially opened on 3 December 1828. Fabre's generosity led others to follow his example, notably Antoine Valedau who donated his collection of Dutch and Flemish masters to the city. On the death of Fabre in 1837, a legacy of more than a hundred pictures and drawings completed the collection.\nIn 1864, Jules Bonnet-Mel, an art collector from P\u00e9zenas, bequeathed 400 drawings and 28 paintings. In 1868, Alfred Bruyas gave the works from his private gallery to the city. He is credited with having moved the museum collection into the modern era. In 1870, Jules Canonge, from N\u00eemes, gave a collection of more than 350 drawings. A legacy of Bruyas of more than 200 works completed his gift in 1877.\nIn 1968, Mme Pierre Sabatier d'Espeyran in accordance with the will of her husband, a diplomat and great bibliophile, gave to the city their h\u00f4tel particulier H\u00f4tel de Lunas, along with its contents. The structure had been built under the Third Republic.Around 2001, the Library moved out of the complex, freeing a sizeable area and offering the chance to carry out a major modernisation and enhancement of the building. This took four years and included a whole new wing. The building re-opened in February 2007.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nSee also Category:Paintings of the Mus\u00e9e Fabre.On display are ceramics from Greece and the rest of Europe. Furthermore, the museum has a large collection of paintings from the 17th until the 19th century, with a large representation of the luminophiles movement. There is also sculpture.\n\n\n=== Painting from 15th to 18th century ===\nSome of the well-known painters featured in the museum:\nFrench :\n\nS\u00e9bastien Bourdon\nNicolas Poussin (Venus and Adonis)\nSimon Vouet\nGaspard Dughet\nCharles Le Brun\nNicolas de Largilli\u00e8re\nHyacinthe Rigaud\nJean-Baptiste Oudry\nCarle Van Loo\nClaude Joseph Vernet\nJean-Baptiste Greuze : 9 paintings including Le Petit Paresseux, Twelfth Night Cake\nHubert Robert\nJacques-Louis David 5 paintings including Hector, Portrait of Doctor Alphonse LeroyOutside France :\n\nItaly :\nJacopo Bassano\nPaolo Veronese\nAnnibale Carracci\nAlessandro Allori : 3 paintings including Venus and Cupid\nFederico Zuccari\nBernini\nIl Guercino : 2 paintings\nDomenichino : 2 paintings\nSalvator Rosa\nLuca Giordano\nMattia Preti\nFrancesco Guardi\nGiovanni Pannini\nFlanders and Holland :\nPieter Brueghel the Younger : 2 paintings\nPeter Paul Rubens : 3 paintings\nJacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael : 3 paintings\nGerrit Dou\nGabriel Metsu : 2 paintings\nFrans van Mieris the Elder : Young Woman Stringing Pearls\nGerard ter Borch\nJan Steen : 2 paintings\nAdriaen van Ostade\nDavid Teniers the Younger : 8 paintings\nSpain :\nFrancisco Zurbar\u00e1n : 2 paintings including The Angel Gabriel\nJusepe Ribera\nOther :\nAnton Raphael Mengs\nJoshua Reynolds\n\n\n=== Painting from the 19th and 20th century, with a number of Fauvist painters ===\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (Vue de village, Aigues-Mortes, La Toilette, Atelier de la rue Furstenberg)\nFran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Benouville (The Wrath of Achilles)\nGustave Courbet 15 paintings including The Bathers or Les Baigneuses, Bonjour Monsieur Courbet\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix (Fantasia, Algerian women in their room)\nKees van Dongen (Portrait of Fernande Olivier)\nRaoul Dufy\nJean Hugo\nAlbert Marquet\nPierre Soulages\nNicolas de Sta\u00ebl\nClaude Viallat\nMaria Helena Vieira da Silva\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nAntoine Bourdelle\nJean-Antoine Houdon (Summer, Winter)\nRen\u00e9 Ich\u00e9\nAristide Maillol\nGermaine Richier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mus\u00e9e Fabre at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial Mus\u00e9e Fabre (Agglom\u00e9ration de Montpellier) website\u2014(in French)",

          "The price is not excessive and I enjoyed the Soulange exhibition. I think I just needed to breathe some art and this refreshed me. Has lockers for bags (1 euro coin needed which is refunded), clean toilets and a nice shop. Free guide in English also available.",
          "Love it. It\u2019s much bigger than expected. You better spare your time for more than 2 hours to enjoy many marvelous french artistic works. It\u2019s worth visiting.",
          "If you enjoy old masters and portraiture this is going to be right up your street. It's well presented although the place is a maze and you will need to keep your bearings if you want to get out quickly. The lifts in the middle of the building serve all floors but everywhere else is dead ends and endless trails.",
          "Excellent place with goergous paintings. Sadly the paint references were only written in french. Not very prepared for foreigner visitors.",

          "Lovely museum, one of the biggest in Europe, great Soulages exhibition",
          "Good.  Bigger than you would think. Much bigger than it should be. Lots of rather dull and minor works of art (IMHO).  But some really nice pieces as well.  Start in the modern galleries (strength of the collection) and work backwards so you don't get wore out.",

          "Absolutely fantastic museum. You can get up close to some fabulous French works of art. We visited during the Picasso exhibition, but they have frequent temporary exhibitions. There is also another \"hotel\" to visit which is included in the price of the ticket. We spent over three hours there, so do allow sufficient time!",

          "Great venue tho permanent collection is uneven - a few outstanding pieces but mostly just OKish. Restaurant onsite is a must",
          "As overall description of the I could mention that is one the very important museums of France. The paintings exposure is focussing mainly in the classicism the baroque and neoclassicism period. In addition should be mentuoned that the whole place is friendly to visitors and gives the chance for relaxation and consideration.",
          "Went to Picasso exhibition which was great but the rest of the museum was so cool. Extensive collection and beautiful rooms. Over 50 rooms to explore over many levels. Plenty of guides in multiple languages in all rooms. All in all a must visit if you come to Montpellier.",
          "Had to wait to get into the Picasso exhibition for about 10 mins but a very good exhibition. The main parts were translated into English but not the individual painting information. The kids liked the audio film of Picasso painting on a board.",
          "A really good value museum for families.  We visited the Picasso exhibition, which really engaged the kids due to well tailored handouts for kids and, of course, a really good exhibition.  The museum is a must do if in Montpelier!",

          "It has good works of art, the museum is well maintained and you get good treatment from the guides.",
          "Ok but not the one of the best claimed by the tourist brouchures and tourist office. Small modern and some 18th and 19th century works. If they are featuring an exhibit of Picasso for example and you have seen the work its woth going to.",
          "Beautiful museum and very rich permanent collection",
          "An exceptional collection of paintings and sculpture especially 18th and 19th c. French like Houdon and David. We are going back tomorrow for the modern paintings by Soulages.

          "Awesome paintings",

          "This was a great rainy day activity. The museum has multiple rooms and floors, you can take it at your own pace. I would suggest spending 1-2 hours here.",
          "The museum has a really interesting and varied collection of paintings. However I found it a really confusing place with very little signage, staircases that go nowhere and lifts that don\u2019t reach every floor. I spent more time trying to work out where I was and how to find the",
          "Enormous art collection over 4 floors in a old building on the edge of the old town. You need at least 2-3 hours or longer to do the collection justice. Good news is free on Sunday but be aware the museum isclosed on Mondays.",
          "Excellent collection with good explication and a clearly high proportion of the male nude. Easy to follow map.",
          "This museum was full of great art. A nice place to spend an afternoon. The space is beautiful. Part of it had been recently renovated.",
          "A very well curated gallery creating a very good sense of the history of art in the space of around 2 hours (if you don't linger anywhere too long). Lots of discussion points and the modern art sits well with the quality of the other, older pieces.",
          "In more ways than one as it is huge and quite confusing ....do feel they should have signs saying which way to go as several exits in each room and we felt we may have missed huge chunks of art. A great selection from old masters to modern \"paintings\" in black of black.....\ud83d\ude44",
          "We spent about 1.5 hours visiting the Musee Fabre. They have a nice mixture of art with various rooms featuring specific artists. With your entree fee you can also go to their decorative art museum - which we really enjoyed. It was only open after 2 pm so we went to lunch",
          "This museum is a must for its permanent collection (in particular, Soulages) and for its numerous temporary exhibitions which are brilliantly presented. One can be certain that each visit will be a mine of new information in the world of art.",
          "This place is one of the place you mush visit in montpellier. its the perfect place for an art lover, for people who can appreciate the color and imagination. If you have time 2 h just visit it and you shall pass a good moment and will want to re do the experiance.",
          "I\u2019m personally most interested In modern art, therefore the collection was a bit disappointing for me. The collection of modern art was interesting.",
          "We had a great laugh at this place, watching the expressions of abject boredom on the faces of the endless stream of school children being marched through the place. Laughter aside it's a lovely building with a range of art - both contemporary and old. I'm not an art buff, but",
          "A wonderful collection of visual arts, every artists most visit the museum, you well spend hours in there, and your family can wait you at the cafes outside the building where the amazing environment.",
          "Musee Fabre is one of the most important French museums and my expectations were quite high. It has been improved and restructured over the past years and now offers a quite extensive collection of art from the Renaissance to contemporary art. \u00c0 regular ticket is 8 Euro and for",
          "Really enjoyed my visit to the Francis Bacon exhibition. The rest of the museum is impressively grand and you could spend hours in there!",
          "We went to the Fabre museum to see the summer exhibition which is called Face to Face and features Francis Bacon and Bruce Nauman. We didn't like Francis Bacon's work before we went but went with an open mind. Sorry to Francis Bacon but we still don't like his work and find it",
          "I really enjoyed this simple and small, yet really worthwhile museum in the city of Montpellier. For such a small museum it really had some great art and the paintings were beautiful. I would reccomend others to go here if they are ever in the city of Montpellier France.",
          "A surprisingly large permanent collection and some really great temporary exhibits (I loved the Mucha show a few years ago, and this summer's Bacon/Nauman show was excellent too. Beautiful building, and setting in general. I have found in the past that the map is incredibly hard",
          "This is a great Beaux Arts museum. We are art lovers and we went to Montpellier almost by chance. We added this museum at the last minute to our itinerary. What a revelation! It ended up being the highlight of our Southern France trip. Lots of classic art in this gem of a",
          "Wished we had allowed more time for this. We only saw a fraction of the rooms, but they were filled with great old Dutch masters. Want to go back.",
          "We visited the museum without knowing what to expect. The expositions are well distributed and the contrast between white and red rooms makes the whole experience even more interesting.",
          "This is an extremely well thought out museum with the goal to educate and inform. Starting with a room where you can touch the art and explore the texture is wonderful for children and adults as well. There is a lot to cover and on each level there is an area room with a film",
          "We went to see Francis Bacon but there was so much else to see in other parts of the gallery. A really great place for art lovers to go.",
          "Not only is this the perfect sized museum ( not too small or big) but it really interacts with the community through classes for the kids during the vacations and open/free museum days the first Sunday of every month.",
          "The museum has reopened a few years ago to great acclaim. It is very pleasantly laid out ; however, there is very little of genuine interest despite the extensive collection on display. The works are fine but consistently minor. The much hyped Soulages make no mark, and the",
          "There is a lot to see here but its somewhat disappointing - The modern art seemed to consist of a lot of what looked like fence panels painted black, There is a good collection of dutch 15th/16th century art. But no french impressionists although there are a couple of pre",
          "Good selection of art including many from Frederic Bazille. Allow 1.5-2 hours to visit. Cafe on site, although we did not visit, plus a shop.",
          "Extensive collections spread through many rooms. Many outstanding pictures donated by patrons. One of the top ten provincial galleries. Strong on Dutch and Flemish pictures. Modern collection excellent. Easy to follow layout and good labelling in French and other languages.",
          "With more than 800 pieces in a collection housed in three buildings, this is a great place to while away a few hours. Aircon makes its a cool visit in the heat of the day. The collection spans decades from 14th century gilded religious art to contemporary with some enormous",
          "This gallery is a real gem, set just off the town has an impressive amount of French and international paintings from different eras. I'd say I spent about 90 minutes here, but could probably have spent more. It is beautifully laid out, and not too crowded. I was unexpected",
          "This was the last museum we visited during our stay in southern France. It is a real gem. It has several Masters paintings which are well worth seeing. It all has several \"local\" artists who painted the wealthy gentry in the surrounding area...which gives you a deeper insight. I",
          "In this museum we just visited the rooms with Soulange work. Just beautiful and creative. The building itself, is very nice inside, large, people working there very polite and positive!",
          "We spent 1.5 hrs here on a Wednesday morning, the place was very quiet, and probably saw less than 50% of the exhibits.",
          "Impressive building and a large display of art, but as the title says it was all much of a muchness. The red room is impressive in scale and there as few Rubens and Delacoix I found that gave me reason to stop and soak them in, but I ended up finding it slightly dull and sped up",
          "Lots of nice art objects I Went there when they opened, but there was a lot of schoolclasses there. Maybe better to go after lunch.",
          "They redid this museum a few years ago and now the interior and exterior look great. The problem is that I've been there several times and never once seen an exhibit that inspired me. They seem to try to be as bland as possible so as not to offend anyone. I wish they would take",
          "This is one of the most important museums of art in the world and beautifully laid-out. At around 8 euro for a ticket, it's a brilliant way to spend 1-3 hours seeing some this extraordinary collection.",
          "Had read elsewhere that it was free to view the permanent collections. Not true, but \u20ac7 was worth paying to see this varied mix of styles. Loved the \"touch me\" exhibits - good to feel the sculptures and appreciate them with a different sense. The modern collection created quite",
          "Set over three floors, a strong range of paintings from the 14th to the 19th Century. Almost exclusively French painters, including Delacroix, Poussin, Le Brun, particularly strong on classical and neo-classical themes. Temporary exhibitions as well. Delightful rooms,",
          "If you want to see marvelous and famous paintings of Frederic Bazille, Pierre Soulages...it's the place to go",
          "Although this is not the Louvre or the Prado, the museum has a significant collection of European Masters, and lesser known artists. Nicely arranged on several floors, both the paintings and sculpture are nicely presented. This museum is well worth several hours visit and, if",
          "This is a lovely place to visit. A major theme was making the museum accessible to people with visual or hearing disabilities,which I think is very thoughtful and adds many insights for everybody. Two of the guards on the main floor were exceptional. They not only guarded the",
          "There are some real gems here and a chance to learn about some lesser-known artists of a high standard. But there is also a lot if junk and reducing the number of works by half would cause no loss and make it easier to appreciate the good pieces.",
          "Outstanding. Would not be out of place in New York or London, wonderful to have this fabulous Museum in this part of France. Particularly loved the Dutch masters but there is so much to see and such a high standard - Rubens, Breugel, Monet and some very early 14th century art -",
          "I really liked how the art was arranged by time periods - helped to understand the progressions of style. Very well rounded display of artists; portraiture, landscapes, still lives, small, big. Also a couple of rooms with sketch pads. I had no problems going up close to view",
          "We saw very little of the permanent collection. We spent most of our time in the special exhibit of paintings of native son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, which was superb. From what I saw of the rest of the museum, it definitely merits a visit.",
          "We toured the museum and a Brazille exhibit. Outstanding collection of Brazille paintings and sketches as well as paintings by Monet, Manet, Renoir and others. A mind-blower to see so many master impressionists in the museum. Their other collected items are also excellent.",
          "We went to an excellent exhibit of the Impressionist Frederic Bazille, an equal contemporary of Monet, Renoir & Manet. There were many painting from all over the world, many very large one, particularly Monet. The exhibit put side by side works from many painters that were",
          "We love the Fabre Museum and went especially to see the Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille exhibition. It runs until 16th October every day except Mondays from 10.00 - 19.00. The entry price is \u20ac10 and audio guides are available for \u20ac3 We had never heard Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille. He was born in",
          "This excellent museum in the South of France habours a great collection. The show on Frederic Bazille was fascinating to visit.",
          "We went to the gallery specifically to see this exhibition, but the overall experience is superb. The exhibition itself if excellent, with great pieces intelligently curated. The museum itself is worth a visit and has been refurbished to a good standard. Highly recommended.",
          "Till October there is a temporary exhibition about the impressionist painter, Bazille, who was born in Motpellier. Such amazing paintings were collected not only from his life but also his companions (Monet, Sisly, Delacroix) that cannot be seen at the same place. The price of",
          "Beautifully modernised major art gallery. We found the main collection a little bit of a struggle - but the seemingly endless pre 19th century religious & mythological scenes etc gave way to some stunning Courbets and above all we enjoyed the more manageable Bazille exhibition",
          "This is a most enjoyable experience. A size able gallery with exceptional art and superb special exhibitions. Surprising to see such interesting and diverse work outside Paris.",
          "We planed to go to see the special exhibition and the cashier suggested that as it was Sunday, the main exhibition was free. Perhaps we might want to see that one first.... Two/three hours later we adjourned for a glass of wine... Bought the book to read more about the gallery",
          "Very extensive museum with a beautifully curated temporary exhibition, well worth the visit. Apparently the restaurant outside is good too.",
          "Our friends suggested the Musee may be worth a visit. We were lucky to find a major exhibition of Bazille, a key French Impressionist who was from Montpellier. The exhibition was chronological in explaining his life and the development of his style, and included works by Monet,",
          "Reasonable entry fee of 7 euro worth a visit and works of art well laid out with plenty of seated viewing spots",
          "Talented artists, but none that you have ever heard of. OK, there might be one or two works by major artists in here, but essentially these are works that got a bronze medal or honorable mention, not the gold or silver.",
          "Definately worth a visit, I'd highly recommend it. Some great exhibitions and easily accessible location in the centre of montpellier",
          "It is a human size museum but the seasonal exhibits are always high ranking. There are thematic visits some at night that are recommandable",
          "If you are an art lover and are visiting Montpellier this is a must, both for the building and the artworks. There are some well known gems by Courbet, a few works by Ingres and Delacroix, as well as paintings by contemporary artists from the region who have made an",
          "I was pleasantly surprised at what a beautiful museum this is. Ranks right up there. Not overwhelming.",
          "Well maintained. Well lit museum. Not too big perfect for a 2 hours or 3 hr visit. Didnt get time to see the caf\u00e9 restaurant but their activities for kids were mesmerising. They had a booklet to visit the museum, make their notes drawings etc. Must see do not miss the beautiful",
          "The kids had had enough of art for one holiday so we had time to explore the whole museum. The (friendly) woman who sold us our ticket pointed out that we could leave after viewing half the collection and maybe come back later. We could have taken this as a sign. The museum is",
          "Pretty impresive collections of European art including three paintings by Rubens, Delacroix, Manet and Degas. Must see during your stay in Montpellier.",
          "Be sure to set aside some time to explore this museum. The permanent collection is impressive with several unexpected stunners and a reappearing benefactor whose periodic portraits seemed like a charming inside joke among friends. The Brazille exhibit blew me away. It was",
          "Don't hesitate...GO to this amazing building along the park in old Montpellier! The art is varied and amazing. Give yourself a treat!",
          "In his short life, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille was a great impressionist artist, and perhaps more importantly, influenced other French artists from that period with his wit, his commitment to craft and skill, and with his family's money that enable him to buy various works. I can't pretend",
          "The people of Montpellier have invested heavily in one of their main assets... A beautiful collection of paintings, obviously with a heavy accent on painters from the Languedoc - Rousillon region including the artist for whom the museum is named Francois Xavier Fabre 1766-1837",
          "The building is modern on the inside so a real treat to see. The works in the main gallery are exceptionally well laid out. If you are someone that doesn't know a lot about art, this is a good place to start. The works are laid out in chronological order so as you tour you",
          "Went here with a friend when we didn't have so much other things to do and it was nice. We spent some hours walking around looking at all the different paintings and the hotel that's just around the corner from the museum. I'm not that interested in art I just enjoy watching",
          "A 'must' visit when in Montpellier. Some interesting pictures in the permanent collection. This year's exhibition is of paintings by local born, little known artist, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille. Friend of Monet, Bazille could have been an even greater artist if he had lived longer, but he",
          "This museum is really well laid out and the exhibition on Bazille and some of his contemporaries is fabulous. So many amazing paintings. I took the translated information which was very informative. This was definitely a wonderful experience if you like looking at art. The",
          "A very nice museum who regularly offers some interesting exhibit. Located by a pretty \"promenade\" right in the center of town. The permanent collection has some nice piece - classic and modern.",
          "A wonderful presentation of art.had a very good day visiting it with friends . learned some new stuff and saw a lot of cool paintings.",
          "Nice museum in Montpellier. In permanent collection you can discovered lot of painting from Soulages in the second floor. If you are lucky you could find also special exhibilion like Caravage.",
          "Musee Farbre is a good museum that is thoughtfully set out which tells an interesting tale of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille and other well known Fench artists and their paintings. Take the time to appreciate and you won't regret it.",
          "Visited on a near empty day in May. Fine choice of french painters but i cant say anything stood out for me. Maybe its a personal choice.. \u20ac7 entry very good value.",
          "Quite modern inside and with a format that leads you through from 16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish to modern day. A modest entry fee and certainly on a Sunday morning almost empty.",
          "This museum holds a fantastic collection of paintings and sculptures. It is not crowded so it is easy to stop to have a close look at the paintings. There is also a nice cafe on site for a drink at the end of the visit.",
          "There's lots to discover in this sumptuous art gallery. As it's never very crowded one can get lost in galleries and corridors feeling as if it all belongs to you. The staff are friendly and there's an excellent bookshop at the exit.",
          "We enjoyed a morning at the Fabre Museum. I had not been familiar with Fabre's work, and enjoyed it. There are a number of master works by other local artists of a very high quality.",
          "Among several very nice pieces the most stunning is an immense pillared room housing a set of grand-scale canvases telling the story of Dido and Aeneas in baroque splendor. Older children will like!",
          "We just had coffee and a snack after visiting the museum. It is a nice place. I can recommend it without reservation.",
          "Wonderful surprises in this small museum, including some Monets, Delacroix sketches, and late-nineteenth century masters.",
          "Enjoyed this art museum which featured numerous artists from the Montpellier area including Fabre. The building alone is worth the visit.",
          "We spent a long morning wandering through this charming museum, housed in an old mansion. Highlights for us were the old Flemish Masters interior paintings and portraits, and a few special French Impressionists, including a Degas and a Berthe Morisot. The room \"guards\" were",
          "I've always considered this one of the most important fine arts museums in France. The museum was created in 1825 by local artist, Francois Fabre. It has a wide collection of Flemis, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and French masters. There is a large collection devoted to city's native",
          "I enjoyed the museum, a very nice facility, and an impressive collection. I especially liked the small number of Impressionist works. I didn't care for much of the modern art on display.",
          "I visit Montpellier annually in late summer and often stop in this fine, though small, museum just down from the Place de la Comedie. Although the museum has a interesting permanent collection, its special exhibitions have been particularly worthwhile - the exhibitions on",
          "Nice collection of 17th century art. I think for the size of the museum the collection is worthwhile. Takes about 1.5 to 2 hours.",
          "We spent all Sunday reviewing the special African art exposition as well as the regular collection! Both were special.",
          "I spent 2 hours in this lovely museum on a rainy afternoon. They have great collection of international and French art from 16th to 20th century. Make sure to visit the last floors of the permanent collection for some highlights of French modern art.",
          "It's a small museum, not super well organized nor with much explanation to the permanent collection. Perhaps some background materials in English would help the viewer better understand.",
          "Fabre was a local painter, and the gallery has a good, chronologically arranged collection of both French and other european painting and sculpture. Not much early (ie pre Renaissance) material, but very good on the 18th and 19th centuries, and seeing all those gloomy landscapes",
          "Really reach collection of art and artists. Very well presented and easy to understand. Each room has printed information about the subject. I enjoyed my visit!",
          "One of the best fine art museums in Europe. Well organised and plenty of good seating. The film on Fabre is worth watching to get the history of his art and the museum.",
          "I was delighted to come across \"Bonjour, M Courbet\". Also a good understated Manet. A couple of good Delacroix. Quite a few second-rate French nineteenth century painters.",
          "This museum sits in a XVIII century mansion. Its renovation 10 years ago extended its area to 9000 m\u00b2. Although it has a collection of paintings from the XV to the XVIII century, my favour is for more recent painter including Delacroix, Bazille (15 \u0153uvres) and Courbet (16",
          "This museum is a little gem. I am interested in the work of Bazille who, of course, came from Montpellier, so this museum was particularly interesting to me. But apart from that, there are so many other wonderful paintings including abstract (for which I have little",
          "You'll need a few hours to visit this beautiful museum, the building itself is great and the pictures are surprisingly good!",
          "Some interesting 20 and 21 century art. The rest isn't worth while. Too much interest on the local artists, death since long and famous locally.",
          "This place is an extraordinary mixture of a top class international collection of some of the really big names of European Art combined with a nice, almost parochial, collection of pictures by local artists from Montpelier. Great Flemish and Dutch Genre collection. I have to",
          "Works from all periods. We especially enjoyed the 19th century paintings. But the holdings in 16th and 17th French, Flemish and Italian masters are also surprisingly rich.",
          "While compared to other large city museums the Musee Fabre is actually not very big, but compensates its smaller size with fantastic art collections. You'll have a look into different centuries and trends, from very Renaissance to super contemporary. It's a definite must-see for",
          "Large exhibition of Naples artists. Only average. There was a lovely Reynolds in permanent exhibition.",
          "I was helped alot here like no where else if you love Caravaggio..lagedor Naples ,Ribera is a strong contender ..he is a master of chia scura with less drama ..hands and feet great the child brought me to tears you can feel his courage !!",
          "What a lovely art museum this is! We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of art pieces on display ranging from the 17th to the 20th century. In particular, the Dutch Golden Age paintings were absolutely gorgeous. Not necessarily the major works of the masters (don't expect",
          "They have an impressive collection of Dutch and flemish masters If you are a fan this museum is a must. The exhibition about painting in Naples was also a big treat for art lover like me. The guide did her work extremely good.",
          "The highlight was the 14 Courbet in one room including the famous Bonjour Monsieur Corbet and his famous self portrait smoking his pipe as a young man. The Berthe Morrisat of a young woman sitting in the garden. The Manet portrait of Proust is much larger than you imagine. The",
          "This museum is centrally located and has a nice permanent collection, but we came mostly to see the exhibit on Naples, which was fantastic. It is worth the few euros to get the audio tour.",
          "Worth of visit. Museum Collection Is more then We expected in rather small city such as Montpellier. Very nice structure as Well.",
          "Was not expecting much so was very surprised how wonderful this museum is. Get the audio guide it was fantastic and give yourself time to eat at the restaurant which is amazing. I learned so much at this museum it was a highlight of my trip.",
          "If you have ever been a student of art this musee offers you collections both fixed and special exhibitions to rival the best. This months exposition was L'Age d'Or de la Peinture \u00e0 Naples. Superb. The staff were friendly, helpful and courteous.",
          "A lovely space but the pieces felt try dated and there was no explanations in English for us to understand what we were seeing. Students are free which was cool.",
          "I was surprised by the quality of the museumcollection. Fabre (and Montepellier) should be visited if you are interested in Bazille of course, who was from Montpellier, but the collection is of a much wider interest. The museum is very welll kept.",
          "Pleasant not overly large art gallery, special exhibition added to interest. About an hour and half will suffice.",
          "This beautiful museum with a range of art provided a nice respite on a hot day. There was a special exhibit on Naples that was a real plus. The museum was quiet and there were many places to sit and view paintings in detail. The gift shop had some nice things.",
          "They also have a wonderful museum shop with lots of interesting books and souvenirs. The museum is housed in a very old and historic building but it has been completely restored inside so it appears quite modern - and it is air-conditioned - once inside. Buy a ticket that",
          "brilliant exhibitions , lovely caf\u00e9 and gift shop. Super friendly staff. very well priced. We went for general show of 7 euros and was well worth it lots to see .",
          "not too large. some well known artist and sculptures. Engaging staff. Easy to find. An enjoyable few hours",
          "We visited the Museum during a recent visit to Montpellier. We were lucky enough to catch an exhibition of the Golden Age of Naples which was really wonderful. The permanent works were excellent too and the building is beautiful. The works by local painter Bazille were",
          "A fantastic building. A broad collection of Flemish Masters with the biggest names, a wide range of 19 th century painters, sculptures and much more. But the specially build section showing Pierre Soulages is my prefer\u00e9. I became a member and go and sit in the room looking to",
          "This is a very well laid out museum very near the conference center. There is extensive Dutch as well as French paintings, some from the area! The cafe out side in the courtyard is great for a Expresso and snack There is a park nearby with beautiful water fountains make for a",
          "For me, the highlight of this museum was the extensive collection of Dutch paintings. There is also a large collection of French paintings of the academic sort, which do not appeal to me as much, but that's a matter of taste. The museum is spacious and well-lit.",
          "This museum is a carefully curated and well-designed gem in Montpellier. The lack of crowds and galleries filled with natural light create a feeling of calm spaciousness. It's a lovely way to while away a few hours.",
          "My husband and I were very pleased to have found this museum because the collections are wonderful. There is such a variety of artwork, including some of the world\u2019s great masters. Plus there are works by Fran\u00e7ois- Xavier Fabre, the Montpellier painter who founded the museum in",
          "A large collection of interesting artwork! I liked the last part of the permanent collection the best as it contained more modern art!",
          "Musee Fabre is located close the Place de la Com\u00e9die and it is for me the best museum of Montpellier. In this museum there are many artworks from 14-15th century to the contemporanean ages. It has divided in two sections: the permanent section with some pictures and a big room",
          "We stopped off at Musee Fabre and were surprised about the quality of Art on display. It is an interesting collection that one would not expect in a regional city like Montpellier. The European masters are as good as you see in the Major city galleries - Paris or London. But",
          "Wow. Impressive space, collection and incredible location. There was far more to the museum than I had anticipated and I wish that we had allowed more time to soak in what was available to see. Well recommended.",
          "Impressive gem of a museum -- 17th - 20th century European fine arts masterpieces, well displayed. Museum building itself is a work of art. Inexpensive admission. Staff is helpful, friendly. Easy walk from the town square, the Place de la Com\u00e9die.",
          "It might not be one of the flashier museums, but it has a bit of everything - not so much modern art. It is certainly bigger than it looks from outside.",
          "This is a fascinating and large museum of fine art. At 7\u20ac each we felt it worthwhile. Our only real criticism was the leaflet that was handed out to help one find the best way round, could have been simpler; it was a bit difficult to wander around with It.",
          "This museum is a must. It has an extensive collection of art and artifacts that are displayed in a building that has been embellished through a modern but highly attractive building extension. Though a museum by name, it is just as much an art gallery and has a very commendable",
          "bit confusing to find your way around - not well sign posted. Not really for me but then again I am not a fan of Flemish artwork - good selection",
          "I had high hopes for this museum experience, but that feeling quickly disappeared after purchasing my ticket. I understood the collection would be limited, but didn't expect just how limited given the size of the place. The Flemish and Dutch pieces are good, and the Salle",
          "When was the last time You have been in art gallery? Have you ever had a closer look at the original painting dated in the middle of 17-th century? For me both answers were embarrassingly adverse :-( That's why I'm happy I have visited Musee Fabre. I'ts not the Louvre or",
          "Something completely unexpected. I was own my own visiting that wonderful and fine collection of art, and that's a really strange experience these days. Difficult to spend less than 2 hours there. The staff is helpful and friendly. Not to miss the collection of modernist art.",
          "Be prepared to spend several hours in the museum, there's soo much to see. When we bought our ticket, we were frienldy informed that we could leave the museum for coffee or for lunch, and come back to see the rest, a very good idea indeed!",
          "I was in Montpellier visiting a friend but, as she had to go to class all morning, I went to the Musee Fabre on my own. Probably one of the best experiences I've had in an art gallery (I don't know too much about art). It is really huge, nicely laid out, the paintings were",
          "This is a fairly large fine Arts Museum located in what appears to be an old palace. The good news is that the place is modern inside ,the works well displayed and the staff pleasant. Unfortunately the quality of the art works displayed is not on par with their setting. There is",
          "The museum has lots to see, so don't try to do everything in one day. Better to seek out the specific things you want to see and spend time there. We made the mistake of trying to see everything and found it too difficult and tiring!",
          "On the oil painting side, has a bit of everything, with some focus on local artists who gained fame, such as Cabanel and Bazille. Also a few sculptures. After the Languedoc sections, the most interesting rooms might be those devoted to Delacroix, and the Impressionists. While",
          "Really worth a trip to this Museum - very informative and enjoyable visit. Airy rooms, huge windows. Particularly liked the sculpture gallery.",
          "Great museum with revolving exhibits. We visited during a pointillism exhibit of the works of Paul Signac and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. A must-visit in Montpellier.",
          "This is a wonderful museum for those who appreciate art- bear in mind though, that there is a lot to see, so make sure you plan what to visit and prioritise accordingly. Sometimes they also host temporary displays and special exhibits, so do check those out. Staff are friendly,",
          "Recommended for painters' lovers. It's big, the works displayed are amazing, it does take time to visit it all, so it's highly recommended to have a good meal right before you enter. I do think it's expensive for a \"ville\" museum.",
          "The Fabre Musuem is housed in a very beautiful old building which is delightful to wander through. Staff at entry are friendly and helpful and the permanent collection is large and interesting. Difficult to cover in a day - certainly worth a visit if you are in Montpellier.",
          "An hour or two at the Fabre in between coffee and aperitifs is always worthwhile. If the temporary exhibition doesn't appeal (Viallat this summer, admittedly not to everyone's taste) there is the opportunity to browse through the more traditional galleries. The admission is good",
          "This is a real find in the heart of the city and it has some wonderful artworks many by well known artists as well as those lesser known to overseas visiter's but which are still of merit and highly regarded by the French. The building is beautiful and it was so easy to get",
          "We enjoyed a few hours exploring the Musee Fabre and the furnished house around the corner which is included in the entrance ticket. A wide range of art from different periods, displayed in a lovely building. Despite being the middle of August it was very quiet and we enjoyed",
          "An collection of well displayed works of international significance in a very pleasing set of spaces. If taste is for modern work I would recommend doing the recommended route in reverse, as you can suffer museum burn out before you get there, as the \"old masters\" collection is",
          "This is a beautiful museum of art, and had it not been for a couple of odd things I would give it the full five points. The French cherish their art, and this extensive collection is beautifully displayed, with full attention to the quality of the lighting, sufficient space for",
          "I had made the Musee Fabre my priority having just a whole afternoon in Montpellier and had not been to it before. It's on the side of a tree covered promenade beyond the Tourist Office east of the Place de la Comedie. This is one of the best classic collections I've seen",
          "The musee Fabre is even nicer than before since the work they have done The themes change regularly and the other floors show amazing paintings that lived through centuries without aging a bit A must go in Montpellier.",
          "We visited the museum during our stay in Montpellier. The location is convenient and the building is beautiful. It is not a large museum. Nice to visit.",
          "We stopped in to see the permanent collection. Well arranged with some very interesting pieces. I liked the flow of the museum too. Easy to navigate. I found it hard to believe that the front staff spoke no English. Really. The woman we dealt with didn't even try. She",
          "When we travel, my wife and I enjoy exploring the city and local food and wine. So museums are not our main focus. Still, I enjoyed this museum and its collection, and I could have easily spent a half day here. Beautiful building itself, across from park",
          "Most impressive. We visited during a short trip to Montpellier and very glad we did. An interesting collection of art spanning a number of centuries. Some very interesting pieces with some excellent examples of the impressionists. Look out for Monet, Manet and Renoir in",
          "It is wonderful. It is well laid out and the paintings and sculptures are amazing. I spent three hours hers.",
          "The temporary exhibits that we've seen over 15+ years are always worthwhile and the permanent exhibit is worth a revisit every couple of years.",
          "The Mus\u00e9e Fabre has undergone a facelift to show off its impressive collection , dating from the 17th to the 20th century. Housed in a series of galleries within a 17th C. Jesuit College, an 18th C. Hotel de Ville and 19th C. extensions, the building itself is quite",
          "I've been to Montpellier often, but never visited the art gallery (which is what it is) despite it being very conveniently situated on the edge of the Old Town and a few minutes from the principal shopping area. Old outside but new inside, the museum has been skilfully and",
          "I'm by no means an art expert, but I really enjoyed taking time to wander through the museum. The recently modernised part of the museum was a surprise to see, it great that they have invested the money and time in preserving and honouring the local art history of the area.",
          "nice building and good that during the day you pay 6 euros and pop in and out. Well stocked shop too. The museum has a large selection of fine art 1500's to 1900's (the most modern room was closed unfortunately). The museum is very clean and well staffed and they let you take",
          "An excellent museum. Mostly paintings arranged in chronological and \"school\" order. A lot to see and we could have spent the whole day there. Very good value.",
          "Clever modern additions to a beautiful old building make the musee Fabre interesting for both the collection and the space it's hung in. It is easy to find on the place de comedie and well worth a visit for a few hours.",
          "We enjoy museums and visit all over. The Fabre is a lovely place with excellent hanging of the works. But, it is largely of painters you may or may not recognize. Some, Metsu, Terrier are good and if the books or my Profs told me they were first rate I would have believed it.",
          "Very large Arts museum with a huge range of high quality paintings and sculptures by well-known artists - also includes present day work. Fabre was an artist in his own right and is exhibited. This is a wonderful find outside the 'great' museums of Paris. Really worth a visit -",
          "This museum has been radically restructured with 9200 square metres of displays, including additional works by Francois-Xavier Fabre, Frederic Bazille, Simon Hantai and others. It reopened in 2007. The building is beautiful and the artworks well displayed, including some huge",
          "This gallery is pleasant as something to do if you have nothing else to do. I entered for free as a student but I wouldn't have paid to enter. Nothing special.",
          "This is actually an art gallery in a gorgeous old mansion containing works of many of the European masters from 15th to 18th century. It's a huge collection and it's really fantastic! And there's currently a special exhibition of the works of French neoclassical painter,",
          "If you need some indoor culture, walk just down from the Comedie area to the Musee Fabre. A nice collection of old master, with some contempory pieces. Nice bistrot for lunch next door.",
          "You need a lot of time to see it all. The Buildings are worth visiting for both the Construction of the museum and for the paintings the museum owns. There are several pieces inspired by the surroundings in the South of France. And the Museums own Collections will take time to",
          "The museum itself is a bit of a maze -- it comprises two buildings, each built around a courtyard, with split levels. Fortunately one receives a small guide with a clear numbering of the rooms. Some of the halls are worth a visit in their own right (the Hall of Columns, the",
          "Liked: not overcrowded, the administration controls the number of visitors for special events, a reasonable collection well balanced with respect to centuries. Not liked: inner organization, signs are not sufficient, it is difficult to find the next room when changing floors.",
          "Whether you visit will probably depend on what's on during your stay in town. The gallery is well located on the green avenue that leads to the Comedie. It is well laid out and we enjoyed a comprehensive collection of Paul Signac, little known to us, but worth having discovered.",
          "there is an excellent collection of art. Several masterpieces of Western painting and sculpture. The building is very interresting too. It is a good museum for kids also and for everyone",
          "They had a special exhibit of Signac which was excellent. The museum itself is larger than I expected and had lots of interesting material. Unfortunately I was pressed for time, so I spent most of my time in the special exhibit.",
          "Montpellier culture available near to Comedie Centre. Easy walk from tourist information centre. We had a tasty baguette in the nearby park (Euro 3.50) ,then enjoyed the Flemish , Dutch, Italian and French masters. Explanatiions available in English from a menu card.",
          "If you find yourself in beautiful Montpellier on a Sunday afternoon I can't think of a better place to spend a few hours enjoying the wonderful collection of this place. Leave some time to browse the museum store, they have nice souvenirs that make great gifts to bring back",
          "Well organised temporary exhibition on Sagnac. Audio guide in English provided as part of the entry fee and was a great help in understanding the exhibition. We had a quick look around the regular galleries and they also have some very impressive pieces.",
          "Good range of art to be seen and reasonable entrance fee. I went there twice and each time it was enjoyable.",
          "The biggest gallery in Montpellier and definitely worth a visit. Spacious and well curated. They have a very good deal if you want to visit over the course of a few days, unfortunately we could only make the one visit and of course it was way too much to see in one day.",
          "The museum always has a varied collection of art to suit all tastes, and the current special exhibition of works by Signac is stunning. This is a museum with very reasonable charges, well set out and the location is easy to find. It has an excellent book and gift shop on site,",
          "I enjoyed visiting this museum very much. When I was there there was a temporary exhibition (until Oct 2013) with many works by Signac, which was excellent and informative. The permanent exhibition was also very good although classical works are not so much to my taste as more",
          "beautifully displayed works of art; very strong in 17th an18th century art; not so much from later artists. A must do in Montpelier",
          "The temporary Signac exhibition of 2013 complements a marvellous permanent collection housed in this impressive complex. The museum is within easy walking distance of the Tourist Office and the large Polygone Centre shopping complex which has handy parking. Your ticket is valid",
          "This is well worth a visit if only for the beautiful buildings alone. Make sure you visit both parts - the main Fabre with the art collection and the adjoining building which has been furnished as a luxurious 18th Century home. To really explore the collections you should allow",
          "The core collection is not to my taste, but there are occasional travelling shows worth seeing. What's most unpleasant -- and this has been my experience and that of other visitors I've known -- is that the guards go out of their way to treat you like cattle. The poster for the",
          "Previous visits were most enjoyable so this time it was especially to view their current exhibition \"Signac The colours of Water\". This collection will remain until 27 October 2013. Ticket price of 9 euros includes the permanent collection of Musee Fabre and a reduction if",
          "Great art gallery. Really enjoyed wondering round look at all the paintings. Its a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.",
          "comprehensive art collection - through the centuries you need time to see it all or choose the period you most like",
          "The museum is set up in chronological order starting with the earliest pieces. You follow the proscribed route through time seeing how art changed over time. The museum has 52 (!) galleries. I was amazed at how large it is. It doesn't look that big from the street. The",
          "The old masterpieces were good to look at, but the modern stuff further on didn't do it for me.The layout is that the pictures are very well spread out but feels that there shoud be more to \"fill It up\"",
          "To be honest this Art Gallery is so high on the list of 'Things To Do\" in Montpellier that I was a little disappointed - as were the two others who came around with me. Perhaps I have been spoilt by the London and Paris art galleries. It certainly is a VERY \"varied and eclectic\"",
          "Great selection of paintings although the way around the galleries could be a little better routed. The ticket also provides free entry to the 12 room Hotel de Cabieres next door, which is WELL WORTH going round even if you're not normally into furniture etc.",
          "Musee Fabre is worth a visit if only for the wonderful collection of Dutch art. But, linger and explore as it offers much, much, more.",
          "A varied and ecclectic collection of art with something for everyone. We particularly enjoyed the extensive range by Dutch artists. Signage was not good and it was easy to get lost around the maze of corridors and interconnecting rooms. Am sure there was much we missed in this",
          "The Musee Fabre is worth a visit for its collection. The Flemish masters are all around and many of the rooms are of interest. As far as I am concerned the permanent exhibition of Pierre Soulages is what makes Musee Fabre a MUST SEE when you are in Montpellier and makes me give",
          "Visted the museum on a rainy afternoon. It is much larger than I expected and has a fine collection of art. You can purchase a ticket, leave for lunch, and return using the same ticket. The information cards (French & English) in each gallery are worth reading. The museum was",
          "If you like Pierre Soulage work of art, do not miss the Musee Fabre which displays numbers of his paintings from all his various periods. Some other quite interesting local painters are on display",
          "The Mus\u00e9e Fabre was wonderful. I wouldn't consider myself to be too much of an art-lover, but I'm mildly interested by it and wound up spending about four hours in the museum. Even though we bought a cheap ticket that only allowed us to see the permanent collection, there were",
          "This is a very nice museum. The collection is not that large, but because it is focused, it is enjoyable. Most of the paintings are pre-Impressionist 19th c. French art. I learned a lot from the information cards, available in almost every room in French and English. There is",
          "This is a must for art lovers. The museum is well designed and by the standards of provincial cities contains a rich array of artworks - from the Renaissance to the contemporary period. As one who loves impressionist art I was taken by the works of Jean Millet and Eugene",
          "This place is huge. If you want Impressionists, go elsewhere, but there are many interesting works here from the 16 to 1800s.",
          "A museum with lots of sunlight to be seen in Montpellier. You can admire paintings of numbers of painters who resided in the Languedoc area. You can see that southern part of France has inspired generations of talented artists. A modern and classical museum at the same time.",
          "We went for the 19th century French paintings and were quite satisfied. Good emphasis on Bazille and Bruyas. Apparently you can leave and return on the same ticket; there is a cafe adjacent to the museum. Very good bookstore. The interior is a bit difficult to navigate. We were",
          "I was not expecting this museum to have such an interesting permanent collection. What a pleasant surprise. The Dutch masters represent a good portion of the collection. French artists, such as Monet and local artists, see their works displayed in well lit and spacious rooms.",
          "The Fabre is a fantastic building, well funded, superb location and easy to access. And then they seem to forget why they are there. One of the best museums in France is run in a way that is underwhelming and often uninspiring. Maybe it's confidence but with so much going for it",
          "The museum's national importance is recognized by it being classified as a Mus\u00e9e de France by the French Ministry of Culture. Around 2001, the Library moved out of the complex, freeing a sizeable area and offering the chance to carry out a major modernisation and enhancement",
          "A wonderful museum with an excellent permanent collection and the audio is only 1\u20ac! Great value and useful for non French speakers. The entry ticket of 6\u20ac enables you to go in and out for the whole day which is great if you have small children or get tired quickly! I don't",
          "The permanent collection holds many surprises. The temporary exhibits are generally quite good - de haute qualit\u00e9",
          "I enjoy the museum and I have to say that from time to time they organize nice temporary exhibitions like that of Caravaggio or the abstract painting. Worth visiting but not an amazing museum, in my opinion.",
          "No art lover should miss this amazing gallery. In a fantastic setting you'll discover a wonderful variety of art and sculpture from local artists (like Fabre) to Dutch masters ('liberated' by Napoleon) and Spanish and French masters of the 16th to 20th Centuries. We only had a",
          "Beautiful museum with wonderful art. And we had the place to ourselves, always a treat. Delicious lunch in the cafe.",
          "a mini Louvre, a master piece.Who would have thought a small city like this would have such a great art museum?",
          "Food here is always delicious and beautifully presented. Unfortunately it is sometimes crowded and hard to find a quiet table.",
          "Unexceptional collection of mainly 19th century pre-Impressionist art. Nice building but there are far better museums elsewhere in Europe.",
          "The Caravaggio exhibition was very good, but the reproductions for postcards etc were most unfortunate.",
          "We never actually good inside the Musee Fabree because each time we tried in our three day stay there were queues into the street",
          "Only 9 Euro's....amazing price compared to what we pay for similar in London!!! TIP : Went early pm on a Wednesday as opening hours from 1pm that day...when I left at 3.30...there was a very long queue!!",
          "We travelled to the exhibition after finding that 2 Caravaggio's were on loan to it when we visited Florence in July. A whistlestop visit for the exhibition, but so worth it.",
          "Superb Caravaggio exhibition. Also, fine permanent collection. Excellent layout and architectural design. Loved the glass wall. Enjoyed learning about Soulanges. Altogether very good.",
          "This museum has a fine permanent collection. It also featured an excellent exhibition on Caravaggio.",
          "During our stay in the area the museum was hosting a special collection of works inspired by Caravaggio, unfortunately only one painting was by the artist himself the others were by followers. However, I was astonished to find such a large and excellent collection of Dutch and",
          "Best exhibition of Caravaggio and contemporaries I have ever seen. Superb location and superb facility!!",
          "Exceptional exhibition on Michaelangelo now being held, featuring some of his greatest works with famous paintings being provided from galleries all over the world. Exceptionally well organised and a must-see!",
          "We live between Toulouse and Lisboa and neither can boast a museum as beautifully restored as Le Fabre. As it turned out it hosted a very impressive exhibition on Caravaggio. A nice break from the beach. We also tried the restos at its entrance, a good offering if you're not too",
          "Have been several times over the years to this great art gallery/museum. Present Caravaggio exhibition only a small part of what you can see with permanent expo. Disappointed with the Caravaggio temporary exhibit as only about a dozen Caravaggio's but 100 or so look",
          "An excellent exhibition. Just forget the fantastic weather and go inside.Even without this temporary exhibition the museum is one of the best in France!",
          "Saw some amazing paintings, sculpture and pottery but found the Faience exhibit of old glazed decorated medicine jars fascinating. Great place to escape the heat for a few hours!",
          "This is a very large musuem spread over several buildings. It is well worth a visit, especially if it is the first Sunday of the month when it is free to enter.",
          "The entry fee is steep if you wish to revisit again. There are not many great works of art to see.",
          "Very disappointed with my long awaited trip there. Asked for audioguide to the collection and told it was only available in French, I tried it but it was too difficult for me to get much benefit from it (only A'Level French I'm afraid), and most of the paintings I wanted to",
          "According to our guide book this gallery has one of the best collections of french art outside of Paris. I have to disagree with that. There was nothing particularly outstanding in the galleries at all and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they happen to have specific",
          "Art is not too special apart from the local artists - but a good way to see a grand house",
          "The museum is about 6 euros if you opt for the permanent collection (there is decor museum that you pay a little extra to go see, but we didn't have the time or inclination). The museum is very large, so I'd recommend starting with what you really want to see because we got",
          "This museum/art gallery was renovated over a four year period and well worth the wait. Frequent special exhibits make for a new and delightful experience every visit. Plus, a really good restaurant in the front courtyard adds to the pleasure.",
          "Unlike neighbouring N\u00eemes, Montpellier does not have a contemporary art museum, but the recently renovated Mus\u00e9e Fabre has a vast collection of 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th century works (including a whole floor devoted to the gorgeous paintings of Pierre Soulages) and is the",
          "It is wonderful that Montpellier has invest to open a large and well appointed museum and art gallery/ We live near Montpellier and have visited several times when they have presented special exhibitions of French artists. These exhibitions have been excellent, well presented",

          "Don\u00b4t miss it if you like paintings. I was surprised to see paintings by some of the best artists. A total discovery.",
          "Skip the old European masters. There are better ones at the Louvre and throughout Europe. But the Modern Paintings are absolutely beautiful. Also the staff throughout the museum are helpful and kind.",
          "Housed in a beautiful building facing the esplanade, it is easy to find. Art is subjective but we really enjoyed the collection of painting and sculptures from most genres. Some of the great French masters are there, Corot, Monet, Sisley, European artists and local modern day",
          "Very large collection with special section on Odilon Redon",
          "Had a great trip to the Musee Fabre, everything was written in both French and English, some beautiful paintings. Well worth a visit.",
          "Mus\u00e9e Fabre has a nice small collection of Art. For my preferences it had a fine collection of impressionists and it is nice to go and see if u are in Montpellier as it is nicely located in front of the Corum, near la Place de la Comedie, etc. However, if you are a museum geek",
          "I was plenty bored w/ the permanent collection here. In fact, the most interesting thing about the museum was probably the piecemeal (and well done) refurbs over the years. Especially if you're also heading to art museums in bigger cities, you are okay skipping this one.",
          "I live here in the region but visited the Musee Fabre for the first time today. Ok, it was cloudy outside so perhaps that affected the light inside but I was truly shocked by how awful the atmosphere in this museum is. Over 60 million euros have been spent on it but I found the",

It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Line 1 runs from Mosson in the west to Odysseum in the east. Line 2 runs from Jacou in the northeast to St. Jean-de-Vedas in the southwest. Line 3 and Line 4 opened in April 2012. Line 3, which is 22.4-kilometre (13.9 mi) long, links Juvignac and Perols with a branch to Lattes and serves 32 stations. Line 4 circles the centre and serves as a connector line between the various arms of tram system. They intersect at Gare St. Roch station, Rives du Lez and Corum.\nThe TaM also manages the large bike sharing scheme V\u00e9lomagg', started in June 2007, comprising 1200 bicycles and 50 stations.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMontpellier was the finish of Stage 11 and the departure of Stage 12 in the 2007 Tour de France.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

          "This is not a very impressive cathedral, but it is worthy to go inside. The light through the windows makes the place to look a bit romantic. We were so lucky that they were playing the impressive organ that day. The entrance is for free.",
          "When we first arrived the cathedral was closed, but we sat outside in a little cafe and wandered in when the doors opened. There was organ practice going on and it was such a surreal experience, very eerie and powerful. It's very impressive inside and out!",

          "I was able to go to the church during an openhouse. We were able to climb the steps to the top for a nice view. There is a large organ inside the church. What appears to be the main entrance with red doors is closed so to enter go down the side street.",

          "Interesting architecture. The church looks massive from the outside. Inside it's dark, cavernous and sparse. I was a little disappointed in that the interior does seem to match the impressive exterior. Still worth a visit.",
          "Went into the cathedral and was in the process of reading the sign when a woman at the desk started shouting at me in french. I did not understand what she was saying and said as much. Apparently it was because you aren't allowed to wear shorts. Which is fair enough but the tone",

          "A cute spot. There are always lots of people taking pictures as it seems to be one of few cathedral type buildings in Montpellier",
          "As far as church viewing goes this is worth it. Not much remains of the original building but it is grand and good to see.",

          "This is a must-see when you're in Montpellier. Fork over the 50 cents for a sheet of paper that'll guide you a bit through the visit. And when you're done, if you enjoyed the visit, why not donate a few euros for the maintenance of the cathedral, as it obviously requires",

          "I was here on a Sunday, passing to Barcelona. Very nice building. Unfortunately, only from the outside because the cathedral is opened at the time of the mass! For sure I will not come here again, after I was treated by the \"locals\" - very rude people live here.",
          "The cathedral stands out as you approach it you feel overpowered by the size and architecture. Set down a small street, just lovely",
          "This enormous church looks like the entrance to a medieval fort at the doorway. We were lucky enough to be there on a Sunday morning when the choir was practicing. The acoustics were amazing. Then the many church bells rang and the sound echoed across the old city streets",
          "The Cathedral a beautiful and historic building in Montpellier. Its organ is one of the highlights as are the stained glass windows. For a visitor, this is a must see.",
          "We walked by on a holiday but did not get to see the interior. Will have to do that next time. I guess it was closed because of a holiday.",
          "Beautifully cleaned recently and the porch is extra-ordinary - but didn't get to see the interior, but certainly worth seeing as is is very unusual architecturally",
          "It is an unusual building from the outside but we happened to pass by on Easter Saturday evening as the vigil mass was in progress so we went in to the mass. The place was in semi darkness and the atmosphere was very solemn, enhanced by the huge roof space and general interior.",
          "Stumbled on the cathedral while walking around Montpelier, very impressed with the interior, which was improved by a singing rehearsal they were to perform there later in the evening with a full concert, we sat down to listen, but they were at the end of their presentation, but",
          "I really like to visit places of worship wherever I go in the world so I was keen to see this cathedral. The outside was impressive - big arches stretch out into a relatively small street. The interior was slightly strange (although maybe I went at the wrong time of day). There",

          "My personal favourite among the historic sights in Montpellier is undoubtedly Cathedrale Saint Pierre (Saint Peter). The gothic Church was founded 1364 belonging to the Saint Benoit Monastery, but in 1536 it was elevated to a cathedral when the bishop of Maguelone transferred to",
          "It is such a joy to enter this historic building.There are some really beautiful stain glass windows.Great tranquil atmosphere.The ceiling is also good, and it was nice to enter into the cool atmosphere , when it was so hot outside.You cannot help being affected by the reverence",
          "Well worth a walk to get to, and see the superb architecture. The cathedral is attached to other buildings housing museums of art and anatomy.",
          "We visited this cathedral, which resembles a castle, during the French cultural days and so we were able to climb the bell tower for free. Amazing view and experience. Highly recommended.",
          "I adore old churches, so while many have described Cathedral St-Pierre as gloomy, I really appreciated the ambience. From outside, it's so big it's difficult to try fit into the camera frame, and the architecture is a bit more plain than other cathedrals. Inside, however,",
          "Fine building in an interesting part of town. But as so often, somewhat gloomy and not particularly attractive",
          "The Medical college next door and its courtyard, when open, also make for some great photo opportunities.The labyrinthine streets around the Cathedral make for an exciting tour around the most curious parts of Montpellier. Lots of high quality gift shops and small cafes reside",
          "An amazing set of stained glass windows in a spectacular space, though the stonework is quite simple and austere by comparison with many cathedrals. Not so sure about the porch, which to me looks a little bizarre and out of proportion with the rest of the structure. Has the",
          "Another impressive cathedral in France, visited this on a day trip to Montpellier, i found it agreat place to walk round and very atmospheric",
          "It is very impressive even when you see the photos of Cathedrale St-Pierre, imagine the feeling to stand before its entrance. Very close to the city center, you should definitely visit it. Very useful during a rainy day. Nowadays, the Faculty of Medicine is situated within this",
          "We went for a visit in May and there was something on with the children so we had to wait outside for it to finish. They let us in and it was worth the wait. What a lovely church and seeing all the families there celebrating was very special.",
          "I really came here to rest my tired feet and for some time away from the sun, after a long walk around the city. I was pleasantly surprised by this well maintained building. It is the seat of the archbishops of Montpellier and whilst not as ornate as some other great cathedrals",
          "A much rebuilt cathedral with loud bells and a fabulous witches-hat portico! Cool on a hot day, too.",
          "The cathedral, tucked out of the way in the historic city center, is distinguished by its twin towers rising above the surrounding buildings. It has a massive porch supported by two huge columns topped with Gothic towers, but the entrance is by a small door down the side of the",
          "I'm not sure how busy it can get at the Cathedrale, when we went we had it all to ourselves! It is a huge and breathtaking place, quite different to many other cathedrales I have visited. Beautiful stained glass, very peaceful, fantastic organ...would definately recommend.",
          "This medieval Catholic cathedral was built in the 12th century as a church and elevated to cathedral status in the 16th. It has to gigantic columns outside the west door and, unusually for a building of this type has very small windows which makes the interior very cool and the",
          "Very beautiful cathedral in the center of the old part of town. The outside is very unique and the inside is filled with little chapels.",
          "This is one of the many beautiful buildings in Montpellier, with its own unique style. When wandering around the city I came across this building, and it looks very nice both from the inside and the outside. Unfortunately when I was visiting there was some construction work",
          "Other than the Comedie Opera house, I think this was the best piece of architecture in Montpellier's city center. Excellent castle like structure outside and beautiful inside with soaring celings, gorgeous stained glass and many intricate alcoves. Definitely worth the short walk",
          "I attended a tour (in French) of the cathedral. It has a very interesting history and lovely stained glass windows. The light filtering in on a sunny day make it magical.",
          "It's lovely to just sit inside and to explore with lots to see. Ornate figures and no charge. Unless you want to light a candle which costs 1 or 2 euros, the usual. Very good and no charge visit.",
          "Beautiful stained glass and soaring stonework, with a serene atmosphere and some wonderful old religious paintings.",
          "This is located close to the facult\u00e9 de medicine, l'arc de triomphe, parc du peyrou, and jardin des plantes, so it's nice to visit everything at once. The cathedral inside is large, darkly lit, and has some pretty statues and paintings. The most impressive thing we saw there was",
          "Worth visiting the church and the surroundings. The faculty of medicine next door is beautiful.",
          "Worth finding though, interesting architecture. Free entry and some interesting art and glass. Very helpful lady at entrance.",

        "wiki": "The University of Montpellier (French: Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier) is a French public research university in Montpellier in south-east of France. Established in 1292, the University of Montpellier is one of the oldest universities in the world.\nThe university was split into three universities (the University of Montpellier 1, the University of Montpellier 2 and the Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier 3) for 45 years from 1970 until 2015 when it was subsequently reunified by the merger of the two former, with the latter, now named Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier, remaining a separate entity.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe university is considerably older than its formal founding date, associated with a papal bill issued by Pope Nicholas IV in 1289, combining all the centuries-old schools into a university.It is not known exactly when the schools of liberal arts were founded that developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools that gathered around masters of rhetoric. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, from the school of law at Bologna, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The faculty of law has had a long career. Professors from Montpellier were prominent in the drafting of the Napoleonic Code, the civil code by which France is still guided and a foundation for modern law codes wherever Napoleonic influence extended. The faculty of law was reorganized in 1998.\nThe prestigious school of medicine was founded perhaps by people trained in the Spanish medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier University. It is the world's oldest medical school still in operation. The school of medicine owed its success to a policy of the Guilhem lords of Montpellier, by which any licensed physician might lecture there: with no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures multiplied, thus providing a great choice of teachers coming from all around the Mediterranean region (Guilhem VIII act of January 1181). The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III, which were confirmed and extended in 1240, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne, but the school enjoyed a great deal of de facto autonomy.\nThe school was famous for arguing in the fourteenth century that the Black Death was caused by a miasma entering the opening of the body's pores, citing theories developed by Galen. Doctors educated at Montpellier advocated against bathing because they claimed bathing opened the body's pores, making one more susceptible to the bubonic plague.In 1529, after some years as an apothecary, Nostradamus entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a \"manual trade\" expressly banned by the university statutes.[8] The expulsion document (BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87) still exists in the faculty library. Rabelais took his medical degree at Montpellier, and his portrait hangs among the gallery of professors.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, founded in 1593, is the oldest botanical garden in France. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine. The Benedictine monastery that had been converted into the bishop's palace, was given to house the medical school in 1795. A gallery devoted to the portraits of professors since 1239 contains one of Rabelais.\nThe school of theology had its origins in lectures in the convents: St. Anthony of Padua, Raymundus Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille all lectured. Two letters of King John II prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Pope Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law.\nIn the 16th century the local triumph of Calvinism interrupted the somewhat somnolent Catholic school of theology, which was reinstated in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. In better days, among Montpellier's illustrious pupils of law were Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers were William of Nogaret, chancellor to Philip IV, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards Pope Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, afterwards antipope Benedict XIII.\nLike all other provincial universities of France, that of Montpellier was suppressed at the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1793. The faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. The university of Montpellier was officially re-organised in 1969, on the aftermath of May 1968 and the students' revolt all over the country. It was split into its successor institutions the University of Montpellier 1 (comprising the former faculties of medicine, law, and economy), University of Montpellier 2 (science and technology) and University of Montpellier 3 (social sciences, humanities and liberal arts).\nOn 1 January 2015, the University of Montpellier 1 and the University of Montpellier 2 merged to form the newly recreated University of Montpellier. Meanwhile, the Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier 3, now only Paul Val\u00e9ry, remains a separate institution.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nOverall Ranking\nUniversity of Montpellier secured 55th and 16th places in the world and Europe, respectively, in Reuters - The World's Most Innovative Universities 2018.

          "In case you want a break from the busy city, the Botanical Garden, is a nice place to relax your mind. It is actually the oldest Botanical Garden in France, created by Professor Pierre Richer de Belleval in 1593 after an order from King Henri IV. In fact, the garden served as an",
          "Such a tranquil space! We loved the huge greenhouse with cacti in it, and the herb garden was delightful.",
          "The garden is being updated presently by Montpellier University and they're doing a fantastic job. Even in late October, there was still plenty of colour. The middle section is closed at present, but around the edge are many varieties of trees, all labelled, including a sequoia.",
          "While as others have mentioned, it is a little run down, there are sections currently closed off and (I assume) being fixed up. Nevertheless, I didn't really mind - not all gardens need to be pristine and manicured! Bring a book, bring the kids or just bring yourself for a",
          "as a very old botanical garden from 1789 it shows the lack of $$ and care over the past period of quite a few years. Run down, and in urgent need of $$ and some tender loving care. While some work is now being done, lots more needed. Orangery [ very famous ] is awful, too",
          "A good collection of plants. Pretty, Calm. Part being renovated. Busy at weekends but quiet in the week. Went twice. Spot the frogs in the pond",
          "A large part of the garden is closed for renovation, the rest has a run down air but quiet pleasant nonetheless. Goo place for relaxation and quiet contemplation.",
          "Mix of new and old garden design. Originally the garden for the Ecole de Medicine opposite. Nice place to wander and relax in away from the City.",
          "We spent a pleasant 45 minutes exploring the gardens and taking pictures. You do have to go in the entrance along Boulevard Henri IV as we walked the opposite direction by mistake and, though we found other gates, they were all locked. Very relaxing.",
          "Kind of smelly. Got the impression that nearby university students just use this place to smoke weed.",
          "The botanical gardens make for a great escape from the pandaemonium of the city and there are lots of excellent cafes and bistros nearby.",
          "This is an ideal antidote to the worthwhile, but somewhat sombre and oppressive atmosphere of the nearby cathedral. The garden has a superb hothouse and a pleasingly informal layout which is a welcome relief from the tree lined open deserts of the typical Parisian type space,",
          "We did not have as long here as I would have liked, so had to rush a bit; but I found it delightful. It is part of the university, and I think it is being restored in some parts, so I am not sure we had access to the full area. There are some beautiful formal layouts in the",
          "If you have an hour and you don't know how to spend it - go to the jardin des plantes and walk the trails Nostradamus walked. Beautifull, romantic! You might meet the wild cats there too :)",
          "We went to visit the gardens during the regular business hours but they were closed. There was not indication as to why this was the case. We tried a second time but the gates were still locked.....unfortunate.",
          "A work in progress but a lovely and peaceful spot nevertheless. Thought there would be more colour. Conservatory of cacti was closed.",
          "These are lovely gardens, the local people appear to eat lunch there. They are very interesting as it specializes in plants with medical uses.",
          "Loved this place! Loved that it's so natural, not one of these fancy botanical gardens but really a keeper of natural environment. Free entrance too. Was told one couldn't picnic there, and so said the signs, so I had my lunch in the park at L'Arc de Triomphe, before heading",
          "Hidden down away from the main town this park is lovely, has a great collection of plants and trees as well as a cactus greenhouse. Also great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the main town",
          "Walking through the Jardin de Plants i found a lot of emotions with myself. Moments of: stunning, amazing, romance, disbelieve, loving and seeing myself and my work. This garden is a joy for all persons in the world....nature lovers, families with children, older people.",
          "It is fascinating and offers a glimpse into what it was like years ago. It is beautiful and quiet and a great place to find a bench and enjoy the scenery or read a book",
          "I agree with the reviews that point out how neglected and under-watered the plants are. It is a pity to see plants expected to \"fend for themselves\" instead of receiving proper care. This is a historical medicinal garden that dates back centuries. What a treasure it could be",
          "We\u2019ve been here before, a couple of times in the last 10 years. Each time, we hoped that there would be an improvement. Sadly, this isn\u2019t the case\u2026 The Jardin seems to be the joint responsibility of the University and the Ville and though there have been some changes, the same",
          "A great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. So pleasant to walk through the gardens which are pretty and peaceful. There's no entry fee and often used by the locals at lunchtime. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We loved spending a few hours strolling through the gardens, it was great to escape the hustle and noise of the city without having to travel too far. It was very pretty and peaceful. Free entry and not a soul around to disturb. Well worth a visit. The locals seem to use it as a",
          "A bit of a disappointment. Parts of it were being rebuilt and the rest seemed a little neglected. Bushes not trimmed for instance. It's a pleasant enough afternoon stroll but not the best Jardin des Plantes I've been to.",
          "The garden has been there since the time of Henry IV which is quite some time and even though it will never rival the more formal gardens of the great palaces this is a place of gentle beauty which is also a centre for botanical/medical research - prepare not to be blown away",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon here. The gardens are less formal than others but extensive. They close around 5:30 pm so plan accordingly.",
          "I've visited here twice, the first time it was a bit dry and I didn't love it. The second time it was after a bit of rain and the plants were alive again. It was nice when everything is alive.",
          "Set in about ten acres, these fine botanical gardens were set up for the study of medicinal plants and the propagation of seeds for exchange with other gardens from around the world. Some parts are formal with parterres and cool rows of cypress trees whilst others show more",
          "Visited in September and saw Lotus pods growing , frogs jumping on lily pads and a thick grove of bamboo. Will revisit in spring .",
          "I think it's probably the best park in Montpellier, but that's not saying a lot because there isn't exactly a lot of choice! Don't expect to lie on the grass with a picnic, it's more of a place to walk along paths talking or to sit on a bench and read a book. There are a wide",
          "Gardeners standing around chatting doing no work for over 45 minutes was our first impression - and that isn't great. Lots of the interesting parts of the grounds were fenced off - under planting - or something or other - but in other climes it would have been open to wander",
          "Great botanical gardens in the centre of the city Interesting specimens It was totally free An oasis of calm",
          "This was the garden of medical research for the university but it has much more than medicinal herbs. Lots of interesting palms, but it was no longer the season for flowers and the famed Ginko trees were closed to the public. But you can spend a pleasant hour wandering.",
          "As newcomers to the city, we were looking for a place to escape to, away from the urban, without venturing out too far - and we found it. The Jardin des plantes offered us a lovely walk through a small forest of various species, a beautiful bamboo forest to observe and a great",
          "The Jardin des Plantes is a great place to go if you are visiting Montpellier. There are lots of different places to wander in this garden - a lake, tree-lined paths, a bamboo forest, and more. I have been several times and I don't think I have visited every part of it! It is",
          "These are very pleasant gardens with some welcome shade in the summer. Unfortunately some of the gardens were closed for maintenance when I visited but overall they were lovely. I would certainly include a visit as you walk around Montpellier.",
          "nice place to laze and cool in the shade. Don't forget to put your head in the college of Pharmacy. 1 hour is enough to do the circle but it's very beautiful",
          "Still well maintained these botannical gardens were the first in Europe established by the faculty of medicine in Montpellier. I have grown a Ginko Biloba from a (stolen) fruit from the first Ginko ever grown in France!!",
          "If you like gardens these are worth a visit, really lovely to wander around with some nice features.",
          "We hope to walk around but it was too hot. We sat and had a rest so did not see as much as we had hoped.",
          "I had high hopes for the oldest botanical garden in Europe and was so disappointed! The collection is sadly neglected, likely because they don't charge an entry fee and so likely can't afford the labor required to care for a botanical garden. The structure is all there, but",
          "We were disappointed with the Jardins. They were not very well kept, closed before midday and nearly half were under renovation. Not worth the visit. The Place Royale 200 metres further up at the top of the hill were infinitely better.",
          "A bit disappointing - in fairness it is being renovated but I felt the whole area was neglected and did not live up to what I thought it would be. Not worth the time if time is short",
          "A nice and quiet walk in the middle of the city close to the Cathedral and the faculty of medicine. The greenhiouses are being restaured and worth seeing. And you have the impression that - walking next to the statues - you are experiencing a promenade in another century",
          "Within easy walk of the old city, the Jardin des Plantes is a good, quiet place to sit down and relax.",
          "Montpellier is hot in the summer - and this is a spot of green just at the edge of the old city walls. Walk it from the Com\u00e9die in 10 minutes. Once there, you'll find ... plants! The Jardins used to be part of the ancient medical school. Many famous people have passed through",
          "Great place with some lovely scenery. Some more explanation about the plants etc would have been appreciated but we still enjoyed our trip there. Great for a picnic!",
          "This is a lovely garden filled with plants and beautiful flowers. There is loads of places to sit and take in the scent of the flowers. It is an oasis of peace and quiet. Just lovely",
          "This is one of (if not the) oldest botanical gardens in France. I visit it weekly, and the changes are wonderful to see as the various plants bloom. There are the various plantings, but I like the pond with water lilies, koi, turtles and frogs. It is a quiet oasis in the heart",
          "We were disappointed half the garden is cordoned off as its being renovated, but it is in sore need of some TLC so good thet they are doing it! A wonderful garden with ancient trees ruins and different habitats including a parterre, pine walk and huge lily pond. Watch out for",
          "Sadly, many specimens were struggling for survival after an exceptionally hard frost as evidenced by the dead palm trees etc in other parts of the city. Whereas a park in Britain would have been a riot of colour at this time of the year, in fact the overall effect was drab.",
          "Nothing much to see and what there is there is all falling into disrepair. I found it very depressing. I named it the Abandoned Gardens.",
          "Established when Montpellier became a seat of medical learning. Has been a bit shabby but renovation on going",
          "as i was enjoying my holidays in Montpellier, i heard people talking about \"Jardin des plantes\", and i decided to visit it in order to discover this famous place from close!! My surprise when i get there was verryy unexpected, its a really amazing place, where we can have a",
          "As I walked on the street and peered into the garden, I thought that I would really enjoy it, but I was a bit disappointed (maybe because we went in March and not everything was in bloom yet?). The dead leaves from winter had not yet been cleared away and a large section of the",
          "This is an oasis of calm based on an ancient \"herb\" garden dating back many centuries. In the center of the old city, yet just off the main tourist roads - it is worth a visit",
          "This rare plant garden features medicinal plants and dates from the time of Henry IV. It is slowly being restored and a lovely place to wander and ponder. The conservatory was being restored when we visited and looks like it will be truly magnificent once completed.",
          "I enjoyed walking around this park, very pleasant.",
          "Jardin des Plantes was a nice place to visit. They had some nice plants to look at, but it doesn't look like a super well-maintained garden. However, the flowers that are blooming when you visit look nice, and there are some nice large trees to relax under. Definitely worth",
          "It is not so much of an exhibition garden as a public park that has exotic plants. So it is a bit worn down and not exactly exciting. But it is a nice little oasis in the city and a good place to find shade and some peace and quiet."

          "Workers are nice, but once you go in, some of the fishtanks are empty and the penguin exhibit smells awful.",
          "The aquarium is very nice, but you can be disappointed if you have visited before some large ones..... The price is tooo high for half an hour (that is how much you need to see everything calmly because the place is quite small )... They have some shows scheduled if you are",
          "I enjoyed this trip as a 30 year old!!! I was in amazement at some of the features. Definitely recommend for 15 euros. It took me about 45 -60 mins to get around. I imagine if you had children you spend much more than this as they have slides and other features geared to",
          "I have been there a few times after the opening, and their collections are impressive! Since then, some of the fish must have grown even bigger (especially the baracoudas in the big tank), so you should definitely check them out",
          "This aquarium is a very nice place for a minimum of four hours visit. It is located in a shopping mall facility and it has easy access with the tram.",
          "It's a nice way of spending your time. The price is a bit high, but the visit is very nice, the traject very well made, there are many species of fish and other creatures. I was pleased with the visit.",
          "That's a very good place to visit especially during the rainy days, the sharks are amazing. Now after few of Aquariums like this one in France, they are all the same....don't expect to find The Aquarium :) !!! cheers",
          "We took our three year old grand-daughter to the aquarium wondering if she would be interested. She was enchanted and we could not get her away. We spent about four hours walking around examining all the tanks. We looked at several more than once and enjoyed the interactive",
          "Spent there several hours with French-speaking kids. Many different fishes, sharks and sea animals on show, some inter-active info available. Some of the written explanation is in English, otherwise you need to enjoy what you can see. Unsure that there are audio-guides. Many",
          "I didn't expect to spend at least two hours in an aquarium. The large aquaria were fabulous. I don't know how long I spend with my nose glued against the glass staring at the sharks and other fish swimming overhead. I couldn't care less about all the semi scientific garbage at",
          "We went here in the summer on a burning hot day day and our two kids loved it. Loads to see and a great option. I would highly recommend it,",
          "if you have 2 hours spare in Montpellier, it's a great idea to take the tram 1 towards Odysseum, and visit the Aquarium. It feels like being in the water yourself surrounded by fish, amazing views and fun watching feedings. Guidance in French and English.",
          "One of the best we have ever seen. This was a really well-conceived and interesting attraction.The themed experiences were especially impressive and for children the 'experience of the typhoon hit ship' was fascinating. GREAT. Must see.",
          "The aquarium is nice for children and families, though some parts are just sad. The big fish tanks are interesting, and the fish seem to be ok (or as fine as a fish can get being confined in such small spaces I guess), the simulation of a boat in a storm is a delight for",
          "This is a great experience, we spent just under 2 hours here. We arrived at about 11am and had to queue for about 15 minutes for tickets. There is a car park that gives you two hours free parking. The aquarium consists of a number of zones that feature each ocean or major sea.",
          "Worth a visit, but cost Euro 31 for two. Good to see the penguins and the talks - for the money they should provide an English translation, perhaps via headphones as husband's French is not up to that level. NO toilet paper in an entire ladies' on the ground floor - had to use",
          "The aquarium is not big but super nice! We loved it and our 2 years old was absolutely happy! They have a ship there with real storm \u263a and it's very realistic! I would definitely recommend this place.",
          "Nice aquarium, good to see, not very big, it doesn't have a lot of variety of fish but it's worth visiting... Spend good time overthere",
          "A great area of different displays, live creatures, perspectives of sea life. Much better than the average 'aquarium' - also providing welcome air conditioning on a hot August day!",
          "Been to many aquariums such as London and seaworld in florida. Doesn't compare to those however still has some excellent fish tanks. Loved the marine fish including the puffa and cow fish. Some impressive sharks. There is a talk on the sharks however was in French. There are",
          "I visited in July and it was wonderful to see different species of marine life. It is a nice and well-maintained place but it is rather small and not as vast as other major aquariums I've been to.",
          "This is a great day out. Go early to avoid the queues. The penguins are really cool as are the different sharks. Lots to do and the info is given in English and French. Great for adults and kids. Allow about 3 hours for the full trip.",
          "Good value for money. Plenty to see and do. The large shark tank was particularly impressive. Very educational place for the children also.",
          "I took my friends to the Aquarium. Even though they did not speak French, there were many things to engage us at the visit. The Exhibition is well laid out and entire afternoon was enjoyable.",
          "I went with my partner, sister, brother in law and 2 nephews, aged 12 and 10. We had a fantastic time! You can see the penguins being fed if you time your visit well. The smell if awful, but they are very cute, and the carers / animators are very interesting to listen to. There",
          "An excellent aquarium. Great for the whole family. Lots of hands-on stuff. Excellent explanations and a realistic experience on a boat in a storm. A must-see for kids of all ages.",
          "If you want to see marine animals and learn a lot about them visit this interesting aquarium. They com mostly from the Mediterranean Sea, hence the name \"Mare nostrum\", but penguins and tropical fish are not forgotten. You can also enjoy without anything to fear the thrills of a",
          "This is a nice place to go with friends or with your family. Impressive aquarium where you can see real sharks! A place to go!",
          "We visited the Aquarium on our last day in Montpellier. Beautifully kept and with some engaging details along the way (where the aquarium is set out like a boat, submarine etc). We particularly liked the penguins and watching the sharks. It was quite expensive (15.50\u20ac) for",
          "There are bigger and better Aquaria in the world but this one in Montpellier deserves a visit. My wife and I thoroghly enjoyed the trip into the aquatic world.",
          "This aquarium is just big enough for young children and quite fun The whole family loves this place.",
          "I was expecting big things when I walked into the enchanting entrance, but as I walked further into the aquarium, I realised its just average compared to others I have visited. Also, I feel its not very visitor-friendly as not all the information boards are written in English.",
          "I hadn't been to an aquarium for 40 years and wasn't at all sure I wanted to go to this but it was recommended by a friend who lived in Montpellier and we didn't regret following his advice. Lots of things to see and plenty of opportunities to learn about the ocean. Nicely",
          "Not a bad attempt, went to the one at La Rochelle last year and found it to be a bit better, and La Rochelle is a small town. A bit expensive @ e15.50c each I thought, about half the price would be a true reflection of it's contents, The Ships bow video display was good though,",
          "From the beginning I was impressed with the aquarium. It was huge, with many different activities, notably the life-like boat experience and the feeding of the penguins. Must-see for all animal lovers; the sharks were amazing, as well as the indoor waterfall. Loved it loved it",
          "I love aquariums but this one was especially enjoyable. I went with my brother (12), my parents (50) and my Grandma (82) and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. The range of fish is spectacular (especially the large shark tank), but it was the educational activities and parts where",
          "I'm a big fan of aquaria and this one was right up there with the very best. Outstanding layout and content and very knowledgeable staff with a clear pride in where they were working. Highly recommended!",
          "The planetarium itself is fantastic and has the capability of putting on a great show. However, this was really disappointing. I would recommend having a look at going to the 7+ one. The show was mostly about moles, worms and a spider very little to do with the stars or",
          "It doesn't look like much from outside, but this place is great, very educational, it has some interesting activities like a wind demonstration and ecological movies. I'm 21 and I enjoyed it with my friends, I can imagine children also might enjoy it. I most enjoyed watching",
          "Spent a few hours here on a wet and wild day weatherwise. Average aquarium, not up with the best ,but not the worst either.",
          "A very nice aquarium with lots of sharks and the usual species. But, it also has a small but impressive collection of deep sea animals and fish from rare places around the world.",
          "This was a memorable visit: enormous tank with enormous sharks, sword fish, penguins, tree slide which our toddler loved, brilliant simulation of a ship going through a storm - really made you feel like you were on board.",
          "This is a really fun and relaxing experience in Montpellier. Next to a shopping mall, movie theaters; there is easy parking and even easier access by tram. Don't forget to validate your ticket after boarding, they have strict enforcement on those trams. We saw they removing two",
          "I've been to this aquarium 3 times now, and everytime I love it! There are loads of different fish to see and it is a large set up which means you get your moneys worth (it isn't just over in 5 mins). The setting and scenery is very well done and makes it interesting and",
          "Highly recommend and lovely to see all the fishes and the animals. So easy to find by parking near the tram line and within walking distance. Nice air conditioned building on a hot day was good for us. Our teenager kids loved all the zones to see and do.",
          "We had to queue to get in as we visited in peak season, but the queues moved quickly and we were greeted by friendly, efficient and multi-lingual staff. This isn't the largest aquarium we have visited but it is well laid out and has a good range of exhibits. Particular",
          "Although a good way to spend a wet afternoon, we only managed to make it last an hour (not the 2hr30 advertised!) and I was expecting a lot more given what you pay for it. Perhaps that's just because we weren't there with kids, but we certainly stopped to look at all the",
          "The aquarium is built around a large shark tank. Guests start at the top and wind down though various exhibits. It is well-designed to engage young children, of which there were many on the day of our visit. My college-aged kids liked it very much and wished they had visited",
          "This is a must for the family and can easily spend 2-3 hours in a calm and relaxing environment, the variety of the fish and getting up close is great, staff speak good English and were keen to introduce the various species and their knowledge, a great morning thank you",
          "they have a cool shark aquarium to be seen, otherwise it is fine but not overwhelming like Marineland or Sea World",
          "My 2 adult children and their parents all LOVED the Aquarium. Cool exhibits and exciting space. All the signage was in French, but we got the idea. Cool sea creatures. Go see it!",
          "I have been there twice, and every time was a good experience. Staff is lovely and helpful. There is a lot to see (and a lot of space). I just think it is too expensive, even with reduced prices (students, etc.) I would recommend it though!",
          "I liked this place. We went on a week day morning so there was no one there. It was really well organised, they had put a lot of effort into the displays and information, and most of all, the tanks were well maintained, meaning the fish didn't look too annoyed that they were",
          "We spent about 3 hours wandering around, enjoying the animals and all the aquarium had to offer! The penguins and 'storm simulator' where highlights! (If you have children, hold on to them in the wind simulator!) Was surprised at how many things we see, do and play about with.",
          "We had a fun hour and a half in the aquarium on a very busy day. There is a good variety of animals and plenty of different things to do, especially for younger children. Mine loved it and I would visit again!",
          "This is a fun day out for kids and adults alike. We loved the penguins and the simulated boat on the high seas! Would definitely go back",
          "Good range of displays and the shark tank is excellent. It is not too expensive and the rain forest cafe is a good place to grab something to eat.",
          "A little pricey but well worth it! We spent a whole afternoon there looking at all the different sea life. It's right beside a shopping centre if anyone fancies some retail therapy after their visit. The gift shop in the aquarium is also very good!",
          "Visited here recently, just out of the high summer season, and had a great afternoon. Entry feels a little expensive, but I think it's well worth it for the clean, modern and excellently presented aquarium. We took my 'spirited' two-year-old, and without doubt it has been the",
          "Clean and detailed information. The kids loved the ship simulator, the big fish pool, and last the hurracaine simulator.",
          "Very happy to go around. Typical aquarium experience - a little expensive when you look at the price, but when you go round, you see it's easily justified.",
          "We took our pree-teens her for a day trip. We have been to aquariums all over the world and this is a good as any that we have been to. It is not cheap but it is worth the money. They have a virtual ship's bridge that is quite realistic and overall it is a very good experience.",
          "We visited the aquarium in early July. We thoroughly enjoyed it particularly the penguins and the hurricane simulator and plenty to see. It was expensive as all aquariums are. It was very easy to get to by tram.",
          "Our two year old daughter loved it- a great way to spend an afternoon, a great range of sea life we loved the penguins",
          "Lovee the aquarium. Was a super visit well worth it. It has very varied basins with great varieties of fish. The texts are really good and the aquariums are amazing. There are some great shows too. Go and see it if you are in montpellier!",
          "This is a very nice, if somewhat small, aquarium. Visitors get quite close to the animals in places - the penguins, especially. They though my daughter's camera was a fish, I guess- they followed her everywhere that they could. The tanks were very clean and clear, and the",
          "The tanks and rooms of the exhibits are as good as the exhibits themselves. The offering is mainly fish with some penguins and reptiles. There are not any large exhibits such as whales. Make sure to spend extra time in the room that you captain a boat and experience all the",
          "We have been to aquaria in many parts of the world and this is probably the most boring poorly laid out one that we have seen. The exhibits are poorly lit, many with small or inconveniently placed viewing portals. There are several \u201cattractions\u201d that were definitely created",
          "Our second aquarium in two days (after the very good Seaquarium at La Grau du Roi), Mare Nostrum was different but equally enjoyable. The stand-out highlight is the ship in the storm, very cleverly done and not just for the kids. The arctic zone and its penguins were also an",
          "The aquarium is well laid out and the fish are easy to observe. It has the added attraction of a ship on the high seas where visitors can experience what it is like to be at sea in the middle of a storm; it is very good for children.",
          "This came highly recommended by a friend, and we were glad we listened to her. It's not a huge aquarium, but we definitely felt like we got our money's worth. Several times we thought we had gotten to the end, only to find there was another room... and another... It is a very",
          "Not the word I would normally use for an Aquarium but this is special - theatrical in fact. First stop is on the bridge of a ship going through the \"roaring forties\" - you pitch and toss and water hurled at the windows and then the lights go out. Great and worth a visit",
          "Easy to find, a big plus! Just off the motorway(Peage.) Well laid out with interesting displays and lots of fun for children of all ages, especially the \"ship in a storm\" and feeding of the various fish and other animals. Well thought out and much more \"hands on\" than many",
          "Thought it was a bit expensive at 15 euros but well worth trhe money. Really well thought out but couldn't understand why cafe was closing at 2 o'clock!",
          "The aquarium is made for kids in mind (5-12 years old is best I think). I went with my 5 years old son and his cousins (4 and 7) and they enjoy every bit of it. The displays are made a bit like a playhouse, you get to experience a storm in a fishing boat, go down a a submarine,",
          "Really nice, not the best aquarium i've ever seen though. But for the price, you can expect a 1,5 hour tour. You will like the storm simulator, as well as the hurricane simulator. A lot of different species, fancy sceneries. Note: if you are an adult, you can skip the last 3D",
          "The Aquarium Mare Nostrum is a fabulous aquarium. The price may seem a little high at around \u20ac15 for an adult ticket, but I can assure you it is well worth the price. All the facilities are very new and clean and user-friendly. Our favourite areas of the aquarium were the"

        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Line 1 runs from Mosson in the west to Odysseum in the east. Line 2 runs from Jacou in the northeast to St. Jean-de-Vedas in the southwest. Line 3 and Line 4 opened in April 2012. Line 3, which is 22.4-kilometre (13.9 mi) long, links Juvignac and Perols with a branch to Lattes and serves 32 stations. Line 4 circles the centre and serves as a connector line between the various arms of tram system. They intersect at Gare St. Roch station, Rives du Lez and Corum.\nThe TaM also manages the large bike sharing scheme V\u00e9lomagg', started in June 2007, comprising 1200 bicycles and 50 stations.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMontpellier was the finish of Stage 11 and the departure of Stage 12 in the 2007 Tour de France.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Montpellier's main railway station is Saint-Roch. There are plans to construct a high-speed railway linking N\u00eemes and Montpellier with the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.\n\nThe Montpellier \u2013 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Airport is located in the area of Fr\u00e9jorgues, in the town of Mauguio, southeast of Montpellier.\nThe Transports de l'agglom\u00e9ration de Montpellier (TaM) manages the city's public transportation, including its 56-kilometre (35 mi) tramway network consisting of four lines and several parking facilities. Line 1 runs from Mosson in the west to Odysseum in the east. Line 2 runs from Jacou in the northeast to St. Jean-de-Vedas in the southwest. Line 3 and Line 4 opened in April 2012. Line 3, which is 22.4-kilometre (13.9 mi) long, links Juvignac and Perols with a branch to Lattes and serves 32 stations. Line 4 circles the centre and serves as a connector line between the various arms of tram system. They intersect at Gare St. Roch station, Rives du Lez and Corum.\nThe TaM also manages the large bike sharing scheme V\u00e9lomagg', started in June 2007, comprising 1200 bicycles and 50 stations.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMontpellier was the finish of Stage 11 and the departure of Stage 12 in the 2007 Tour de France.  It was also the finish of Stage 11 and the departure of Stage 12 in the 2016 edition. The city is home to a variety of professional sports teams:\n\nMontpellier H\u00e9rault Rugby, of the Top 14 who play rugby union formerly at the Stade Sabath\u00e9 and now at the Altrad Stadium.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

          "Inspired by the Pont du Gard, this 18th century aqueduct once brought water from nearby springs to the city. It is currently inaccessible (walking atop the aqueduct is prohibited), but there are nice views from street level or from the ornate water tower.",
          "Definitely a must see and runs along side part of the road. Fascinating structure and great photo ops.",
          "Beautifully structured ancient viaduct. Placed on the top of the hill is giving you opportunity to take amazing pictures. You can\u2019t cross the aqueduct but even the \u201cgate\u201d to avoid the visitors to go in is made in impressive style. The best time to see it is in a sunny day.",
          "Yes this is an impressive site. I walked down into the neighborhood below to take my photos. The neighborhood is not all that interesting but the aqueduct is impressive.",
          "Water tower at the top is good place to view the aqua duct and surrounding countryside, with info boards showing what is in view. Walk from place de Peroux.",
          "Ancient viaduct for bringing water to the city. It is a well engineered structure and the views are very good.",
          "The aqueduct is impressive, no doubt, but the area needs some help. The pool at the arched structure was gross green, the inside of the structure (cistern) was a huge pigeon poop zone with large piles on every visible surface, along with empty water and soda bottles. The view",
          "This is well worth a visit and likely 15 walk from Cpmedie, or 2 mins from the nearest tram stop. At the end of a small park you go up some steps to see an impressive aqueduct stretching west. Careful near the walls as these were quite low with a big drop down. Definitely",
          "Worth going there and have a view on the city. And a bonus: a nice distant see breeze can help you cool down in summer time.",
          "One of the nicest areas in Montpellier to walk up to - it's not far at all and lots of places to sit and enjoy the sunshine and to admire this wonderful structure. Walk back into town through the Porte du Peyrou",
          "A fabulous construction, once Montpellier's main water supply and very reminiscent of Pont du Gard. Just a shame it's not possible to walk along it...",
          "Whilst this long aquaduct is impressive, it does not quite compare to the Roman aquaducts of Nimes (Pont du Gard) or Segovia. Worth a detour to admire it.",
          "Happened upon this amazing structure while wandering through old town. It is interesting to think about the incredible engineering that went into creating and building something so important to the area in days gone by.",

          "We were staying in a hotel opposite the aqueduct so we were very lucky to have the view of it all the time. We walked the length of the aqueduct so we saw it in it's full glory. It's a stunning piece of construction and in some ways has more charm than Pont du gard. I would",
          "Very doable although its build on a hill. So be prepared for steep streets with nice flat pavement. The view at the Parc on top of the aquaduct is marvelous. We had our lunchbreak here and enjoyed our sandwiches with a great view in a calming small parc. There is a beautiful",
          "This really is an amazing piece of engineering and construction! To think that this was the only way the city could be supplied with clean water from the mid 1700s. Surrounded by the royal gardens and great photo opportunities of the city this is certainly a place to visit",
          "An amazing specimen of ancient engineering , great views and some good photo opportunities. It is in easy reach from the city centre.",
          "The aquadukt as well as the surroundings are very nice and inviting for a walk during the day. It is very close to the Jardin des Plantes.",
          "This site is worth a digression from old Montpellier. It includes a pleasant park, promenade with extensive views, statue of Louis XIV, Arc de Triomphe, Tower, and finally the surprisingly impressive aqueduct. The aqueduct or what remains of it is quite long, stretching out",
          "Entertaining and delicious markets happen on tuesdays under the acqueduct. Spent too much money on food but have a few days to finish it",
          "Interesting and imposing in that part of the town but looks like it could soon fall apart as it seems no one cares about repairing it. Nice market underneath the arches, but a long walk to get there from the top",
          "It is interesting, but it doesn\u00b4t blow your mind. It seems nobody is taking care of the place. Wild flowers on the top and a parking area beneath the structure. When the sun goes down you can take better photos of it.",
          "It's gorgeous for sure, and you will not miss it when you walk along the gardens of Peyrou. But there is no grand thing to see. Pont du Gare is much more worthwhile for a visit.",

          "Worth a detour to see this aqueduct and its associated tower and park, a quiet space away from the bustle of this fine city. It\u2019s a shame not more is made of it, perhaps by relocating the parking and traffic from underneath !",
          "This Aqueduct was built to feed the gardens and fountains of the city and is a great piece of architecture, we got the bet view from the top at the cistern end before walking down into the town centre",
          "An antique Roman ruin. Beautiful but the access is usually closed. Not even close to the one in Avignon. Do not go out of your way for just that.",
          "Strolled out to this fabulous aqueduct which gave a wonderful insight as to to the lengths people went to move water in the past. A magnificent structural edifice to the engineers of the past.",
          "It is nice to see an aquaduct at such close distance and easy to get to. Took some photos. Saw it from the park. I hope they maintain it and not let it become a ruin. It is good to appreciate this ancient structure and hope that future generations appreciate it.",
          "Although not used for many years, this is an important example of how an aqueduct works. You can trace it for miles and see the gradual decent of the gradiant from the far away hills to the centre of the city and the reservoir.",
          "This aqueduct was built in XVII century to supply the town's fountains. Beautiful views over the Carrigue from the top.",

          "At the Arc de Triomphe on teh edge of teh old town is a park with a statue of the sun king, Louis XIV. At teh end of teh park is this aquaduct that feeds water to the fountain in the park. Its impressive and worth seeing.",
          "Nice to check this aquaduct out if you are strolling around the Jardins du Perou; otherwise not sure it is worth the trip just to see the aquaduct, unless you are a real history buff.",
          "The pictures we saw were impressive - in actuality is was just good. Shame it was surrounded by a dust bowl of a park. Needs some upkeep to keep it looking good otherwise it will gradually become a total ruin.",
          "The aqueduct in Montpellier, across from the Porte de Peyrou makes for a very nice historical place to visit. Beautiful views and structures. Work the visit",
          "Went to see the aquadukts and was pleasantly surprised that if you follow it far enough, there was a nice outdoor market with lots of food & shopping. We had a nice time",

          "a very old water acquaduct from about the 1800s. With water tower located there too. Great views from there.",
          "If you came by car, then right under the aqueduct there is a large parking. If you walk on foot, then it is directly under the Place royale du Peyrou. In any case, a very convenient point for the beginning or end of the city tour. The aqueduct itself makes a big impression of",
          "Although similar to ancient Roman aquaducts, this relatively new 18th century aquaduct served Montpelllier water demands until recent times. Nicely preserved with stunning views of the old city surrounding city and country and within easy walking distance from the old city this",
          "Visited in Dec so very quiet, good oportunity for photos of the Arc de Triomphe and the water tower and only 5 mins walkinto the old quarter which is fascinating",
          "I was there on Sunday morning, the place was empty and calm, so I could enjoy the wonderful views. Once I took some pictures I took the way back and found an artisan fair with a lot of music and nice things. It's a must see in the city!",
          "I might have previously reviewed another Montpellier aqueduct thinking it was this one but this one is just past the arc de T and is surrounded by a lovely park that has a spectacular view North, West and South. Nice trees, great sunsets, and miscellaneous music (A brass Klezmer",

          "Check out the ancient aqueduct used to transport water to the city from a spring over 14km away. The skyline in Montpellier is quite something with no skyscrapers and this is a great place to check that out. The surrounding park has a relaxing setting and a great spot for some",
          "Interesting example of a pretty old Roman water supply infrastructure. I believe it was built around first century.",
          "It is within walking distance from the Place de LeComedie. Interesting to see this ancient engineering project",
          "Definitely an aqueduct it can't really be mistaken for anything else, except perhaps a viaduct...it's not as old as we thought though!",
          "Impressive. Still looks very nice, but off course not working anymore. You can see the scale of the structure and how massive these aquaducts have been, and still are",
          "Well spaced out with different sections. It has an amazing range of marine life, lots of hands on and lots of information. Great place to take children. There is a lot for them to see and do. The bridge of the fishing trawling is an interesting experience.",

          "This is one of the finest examples of an intact Roman aquaduct I've ever seen or visited. We were sat under the arches in awe of the architectural feet that it is. Go!",
          "This place was incredible. The view from the top, the tree lines, the water features and of course the ancient Aqueduc was absolutely beautiful. BE AWARE~~ the park closes at night and you cannot access the water tower all, the park, the statue or get close to the Aqueduc.",
          "Staying in Gambetta we didnt realise until we got the tourist map that Montpellier had an aqueduct. Possibly not as specatular as Nimes but still an awesome piece of architecture. Great views across Montpellier and out towards the Arc de Triomphe. Although not accessible at",

          "I think aqueducts are nearly always fascinating to look at and this doesn't disappoint! I would recommend going through the Porte du Peyrou and walking through the park to the end and down the steps to get a beautiful view of it. The surroundings are very pretty and there are",
          "Saw many similar on the drive down through France. Nothing special. Park nearby is also pretty boring. Mostly graffiti.",
          "Worths visiting to see! It's a part of city's architecture and adds to the overall landscape! Pity it's closed to public access! We took an evening walk in the square next to aqueduct an enjoyed marvellous sunset over it! I'd definitely suggest visiting it if you have time!",
          "A 17th century aqueduct that descends from a public park overtop of a car park, it's in good repair and if you are in the area, worth a quick stop. The surrounding area is rife with garbage and dog leavings. Take your photo and move on.",
          "We took a walk around Monpellier with a friend and stopped at this park to see the \"fake\" Roman ruins and aquaduct. The park was nice with good views over the city and surrounding area.",
          "Overall nice to see the open sky, its not to bad just to walk along to and look at. This bridge is not old but it is still nice to look at an the view is beautiful. However the area needs to be kept a little cleaner (bits of rubbish floating in the water) and we (like in the",
          "The walk up to the aqueduct was really quite unpleasant. The lower terraced gardens are brimming with dog mess. We were harassed on two occasions by the fountain. The Aquadukt itself is an unexceptional imitation of le Pont du Gard. There are much better things to see in",
          "A remarkable structure slicing through the town. An essential port of call on your sightseeing tour. A bit more on site interpretation would have been nice, but hey, that's what the internet is for right?",
          "The Aqueduct St-Cl\u00e9ment was built during the 1700s modeled after the Pont du Gard aqueduct in N\u00eemes, France. Quite impressive as it runs several city blocks. One cannot access it as there is a locked gate. But an impressive structure nonetheless.",
          "An unusual tourist attraction, this is located behind the Chateau D'eau down from the main town, it stretches out over a river and was used to bring water into the main town, a great view from beside it, however there is no access onto the aqueduct,",
          "It is actually a very well-preserved aquaduct. It is recommended to visit the contiguous park in the eveninto enjoy the view along the aquaduct and the new city of Montpellier.",
          "This is a nice tranquil park just across the road from the Porte du Peyrou. Having sat in the shade of the avenue of trees for a while, walk to the end of the park to see the Chateau D'Eau and the St-Clement Aqueduct. They were both built in the 18th century and the aqueduct,",
          "Though not from Roman times, this 18th century aqueduct is an imposing structure that spans blocks. Apparently it was modeled after Pont du Gard, and though not in a park setting, it is still an amazing structure."

        "wiki": "ZombiU (known as Zombi on platforms other than the Wii U) is a first-person survival horror video game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier and published by Ubisoft. It was released for the Wii U as one of its launch games in November 2012. In the game, the player assumes control of a human survivor amid a 2012 zombie apocalypse. Featuring a permadeath system, it uses the Wii U GamePad extensively to scan the environment and maintain the survivor's inventory. ZombiU was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2015 as Zombi. The port, handled by Straight Right, adds new melee weapons and removes the multiplayer feature.\nUbisoft was approached by Nintendo to develop a mature game for its gaming console, Wii U. Originally envisioned as a spin-off of the Raving Rabbids franchise and a fast-paced first-person shooter, Killer Freaks from Outer Space (with small, agile monsters), the game was retooled as ZombiU after the development team realized that the Wii U GamePad was suitable for slower-paced games. Many of the game's features, including the GamePad feature and the permadeath feature, went through several iterations. Among other video games, ZombiU was influenced by Resident Evil, Condemned: Criminal Origins and Peter Jackson's King Kong. London was chosen as the game's setting because of its blend of modern and medieval architecture and its rich history. Ubisoft Bucharest led development of the game's multiplayer portion. \nIt received generally positive reviews from critics, with the game's emphasis on survival horror, atmosphere, and the permadeath system praised. Critics had mixed opinions about gameplay, multiplayer, story and use of the GamePad. Technical problems, such as glitches and load times, were criticized. The game was unprofitable for Ubisoft, prompting it to turn another Wii U exclusive, Rayman Legends, into a multiplatform game. A prototype for a sequel was developed, but was canceled when the game failed financially.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nIn ZombiU, a first-person survival horror game set in London, the player is a survivor of a zombie apocalypse. They are contacted by the Prepper, a mysterious figure who tasks them to maintain his safe house in order to be properly prepared for survival in this new destroyed London, all while the survivor seeks out a cure for the infection at the behest of Dr. Knight, a scientist/doctor stationed at Buckingham Palace. The player has a number of ways to deal with enemies, and can confront the zombies with firearms, land mines, and Molotov cocktails. They can use an unbreakable cricket bat, which does less damage than other weapons. There are several types of zombies, including those which explode, are armored, or spill corrosive fluid. The zombies are sensitive to light, and are attracted to a player who is using a flashlight or flare. Sound produced by firearms will also attract nearby enemies to a player, who can push them away with their weapon. The player can also use stealth to avoid being noticed by enemies.\nExploration is encouraged in the game. By exploring the game's world, players can find beds (which are save points) and routes leading them back to their safe houses. New weapons, ammunition, and scarce items can be collected by searching areas or dead bodies. These items include food and medkits (which restore health), plywood scraps (used to barricade doors), and weapon parts (which can be used in the safe house to upgrade weapons). As players discover new items during the game, previously-inaccessible areas can be entered. These items are stored in the player character's inventory (known as a bug-out-bag) or a cache in the safe house. If the player's character is killed by a zombie (which can occur with one bite), the character will permanently die and the player will then assume the role of another survivor. The previous character will become a zombie, whom the player must kill to reclaim their inventory. If Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters may also appear as zombies carrying the items they collected. A player can also place symbolic clues and hints, visible to other players, on walls. In addition to the normal-difficulty mode, ZombiU has a \"Chicken\" mode, which lowers the game's difficulty, for new and inexperienced players and a survival mode where the game ends when the player's original character dies.The game's controls make extensive use of the Wii U GamePad. During normal play, the touchscreen manages player inventory and displays a mini-map of the immediate area (indicating the locations of the player and nearby enemies). The touchscreen is also used for context-sensitive actions such as executions, escaping from enemies, and hacking combination locks. The GamePad's gyroscope, which allows the controller to sense its rotation and tilt in three-dimensional space, is also used. While viewing the touchscreen, a player can move the controller to scan different areas to find items. While performing these actions, the television's perspective switches to a fixed third-person view of the player character and the surrounding area. The player is vulnerable to attack in this state, and must watch the GamePad's touchscreen and the television screen in to avoid harm. The Wii U camera allows players to import a face, which will be \"zombified\", into the game.ZombiU has three multiplayer modes. In Time Attack mode, players must kill as many zombies as they can in a limited time. In survival mode, players stay alive as long as possible with a limited supply of resources. The results of these two modes will be posted on the game's online leaderboard. The third mode, King of Zombies, is an offline asymmetrical multiplayer mode. A player, using the Wii U Pro Controller, plays a human survivor who must navigate a map to obtain all capture points. Another player, known as King Boris and using the Wii U GamePad with a top-down perspective, must deploy a maximum of 10 zombies to halt the players' progress and capture a flag. A progression system is present, in which the Pro Controller player and the GamePad player unlock more-powerful weapons and different types of zombies.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nFour hundred years ago, scientist John Dee made what was known as the Black Prophecy. The Prepper (an ex-army, no-nonsense man) prepares for the coming apocalypse, and a secret society known as the Ravens of Dee researches Dee's predictions to stop them from taking place. In November 2012, the Black Prophecy begins to be realized in the form of an outbreak of zombies in London.\nAfter the outbreak the player character is led to the Prepper's bunker, where he receives weapons, a bug-out bag and the Prepper Pad, a device with a built-in scanner and radar. The Prepper, a Raven of Dee, left the organization due to a difference in interpreting Dee's prophecy. According to the scientist, Black Angels would save the world; the Ravens thought that Dee was referring to their organization, but the Prepper believed that he was talking about something worse.\nThe player goes underground while scavenging at Buckingham Palace and is contacted by Dr. Knight, a physician for the Royal Family who is trying to find a cure. He orders the player to find diaries and notes left by Dee in exchange for scanner upgrades and a virucide, a chemical capable of killing the virus in those that are infected. This is done without the Prepper's knowledge, who believes that a cure is impossible. After leaving the palace the player is contacted by Sondra, who leads him to the remnants of the Ravens of Dee and tries to escape with the player in a helicopter on the Tower of London. A supernatural force drives a flock of ravens into the propeller, making the helicopter crash. The player returns to the Prepper's bunker, and Sondra promises to save them.\nIn the bunker, the generator is running out of fuel and the Prepper tells the player to get petrol from a man named Vikram. The player finds Vikram, who has gone mad; he and his young child tell the player to go to a local nursery to get antibiotics for his wife. Despite the Prepper's protests (who thinks the player should raid the petrol station), he goes to the nursery; the staff and children have been eaten by a nurse, who became a ghost-like monster capable of teleportation. The player returns with the antibiotics to find that Vikram has become a zombie and eaten his family, forcing the player to kill him.\nOn the way back to the bunker with the petrol, the player receives a distress signal from a young girl that she and her family are barricaded in St. George's Church. Although the Prepper correctly insists it is a trap, the player goes to rescue her. The player is kidnapped by Boris (the self-proclaimed King of Zombies) and his gang, who force survivors to fight off waves of zombies in the church's courtyard. Boris' lights, microphone, and music attract a horde of zombies, and he and his gang are eaten whilst the player escapes.\nThe player has enough upgrades to collect Dee's remaining letters for Dr. Knight, who believes that he can now make a Panacea. He returns to the safe house, where Knight informs him that the Panacea is not a cure but a vaccine. The Prepper expresses profound disappointment in the player as he returns to Buckingham Palace. Knight has left his bunker for the queen's quarters to access data on a USB key. The player makes his way through the palace, discovering that Knight has been killed and turned into a zombie. The player uses Knight's eye to bypass a retinal scanner and collect the USB key.\nThey run back to the Tower of London as the RAF is about to firebomb London and Sondra tries to keep her promise to rescue the player. This enrages The Prepper, who orders the player to leave the safe house and vows to outlive the Ravens of Dee. After the player leaves, the Prepper (who has been using survivors to stock his food supplies) finds a new lackey to do his bidding. The player reaches Sondra and leaves London as the RAF (the prophecy's Black Angels) destroy the city.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nZombiU was developed by Ubisoft Montpellier with an 80-person team; Ubisoft Bucharest provided additional assistance. The game's development paralleled that of Rayman Legends, another Montpellier project. It was produced by Guillaume Brunier, with Gabrielle Shrager its director and lead writer; Brunier and Shrager had collaborated on the development of From Dust. The team was approached by Nintendo to develop a mature game for their Wii U platform. The team developmed the game using the proprietary LyN game engine. Since the hardware design was incomplete, the team made a number of prototypical games and decided that the new title would extensively utilize the Wii U GamePad. Originally conceived as a tie-in for Raving Rabbids, ZombiU was described as an experiment by Montpellier in adapting the Rabbids franchise for a more \"hardcore\" audience. According to Guillaume, the monsters were based on the Rabbids because  some people found the sound generated by the Rabbids annoying; in the game, players can \"trash and destroy\" them. The association with Rabbids was eliminated by Ubisoft during development, since they thought that turning Rabbids into monsters did not suit the Raving Rabbids franchise. Announced at E3 2011 as Killer Freaks from Outer Space, the arcade first-person shooter had players with extravagant weapons killing small monsters.Although reaction to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while muting the TV display's utility; players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean-Karl Tupin-Bron, the team was saddened by the fact that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted by the results of the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie-game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video-game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name since it was a zombie game for Wii U.\n\n\n=== Design ===\n\nThe team chose London as ZombiU's setting because the city hosted the 2012 Olympics, and its dark history (including Jack the Ripper) matched the game. Although the zombie theme originated in the US, the UK has a blend of modern and medieval architecture which contributes to the game's dark tone. London's proximity to the French developer also allowed the team to research the city. According to writer Antony Johnston, the game features environments from a lavish palace to decaying ruins to \"reflect the contrast of modern London\". London allowed the development team to use Beefeaters, royal guards and a cricket bat inspired by Shaun of the Dead. The cricket bat was the only melee weapon in the game's original Wii U version. After realizing that some players used the bat almost exclusively while playing the game, Shrager regretted not adding more melee weapons and thought that the players deserved a more-varied experience.The Wii U GamePad was described as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.ZombiU was designed as a realistic zombie game. Fear was the game's core emotion and it should be played slowly, similar to some classic horror games. According to game director Jean-Phillipe Caro, players will do badly if they try to play it as a fast-paced action shooter like Call of Duty and ignore the GamePad. A prominent game mechanic is the permadeath system, intended to increase its tension. With the system, the game featured several survivors instead of a hero character. Its narrative was designed to rely on environmental storytelling rather than cutscenes, and players would understand the story through the game experience. The team introduced a persistent level design, in which when players continue playing after their initial survivor is killed. Action by the previous survivor will still affect the game's world; previously-killed zombies will not re-spawn. The permadeath system was debated, with concerns about loading times and backtracking. To ensure that the game's narrative would continue after a player-controlled character died, the survivors were not voiced to avoid narrative dissonance; this made the player, not the survivors, the protagonist. Although Shrager was relieved when the central character was dropped, writing the game was the \"toughest challenge\" she had ever faced in games. Since survivors can die anywhere in the game, linking the story became difficult. The team introduced the Prepper, an important character who communicates with the survivors by radio to link them and advance the narrative. During development, the permadeath concept was nearly removed.\n\nA core team goal was a game which was difficult but fair, inspired by difficult games such as Dark Souls and Demon's Souls. The permadeath system ensured that players are often challenged, since every zombie can be a deadly threat. It fit the game's survival theme, giving players an incentive to continue. The game was designed for players to learn by experience, slowly improving their skill. The Metroid franchise inspired ZombiU's structure, enabling players to backtrack; Left 4 Dead inspired enemy placement, and Condemned: Criminal Origins influenced the game's first-person perspective. Its content was inspired by Capcom's Resident Evil and zombie comics, films and books such as Dead Set and Night of the Living Dead: London.ZombiU's offline multiplayer mode was developed by Ubisoft Bucharest. Conceived during early development, it was kept when the core game was reiterated; its asymmetrical experience made the developer believe in the Wii U's potential, and was the demo Ubisoft showed the public during E3 2011. A cooperative multiplayer mode and online play were planned by the developer, but were removed due to time constraints.Cris Velasco was the game's composer. By the time Velasco began composing its music, ZombiU was playable; its audio director sent him game footage to help him understand the type of music needed. He spent 10 days composing the music, and assembled a string quintet of two violins, a viola, and two cellos to record it. Known as the Apocalypse Ensemble, it played \"rawer sound\" which makes the soundtrack menacing.\n\n\n== Release ==\nZombiU was introduced during Ubisoft's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012. A webcomic, written by Johnston and illustrated by Kev Crossley, was published on November 12 to promote the game. The 14-page comic, Z-14, was the game's prequel and linked ZombiU to the initial zombie outbreak. ZombiU was released on November 18, 2012 as the Wii U launch game. At release, European players could only purchase the game from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. due to a Nintendo-imposed restriction. According to Nintendo of Europe, a German law required that games with mature content be played only at night. After negotiations with the German entertainment software self-regulating organization, the restriction was lifted in March 2013. A Wii U package with the game was released on February 13, 2013. In addition to the Wii U, its accessories and ZombiU, the package contained a downloadable copy of Nintendo Land and ZombiU artwork and developer commentary.Ubisoft executive Tony Key said that although the game was designed for the Wii U, the company might bring it to other platforms. Following several leaks, Ubisoft confirmed Zombi for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developed by Straight Right (who had developed Mass Effect 3's Wii U version), it was released on August 18, 2015. The game is similar to the original, with minor updates and enhancements. Second-screen gameplay was moved to the main screen, only appearing when required. Although the cricket bat was the only melee weapon in ZombiU, Zombi added two weapons. The shovel has a longer range and the ability to hit more than one zombie at a time. The second (a nailed bat) inflicts more damage, has a higher critical-hit chance and can also hit more than one enemy at a time. ZombiU's flashlight can switch to a wider, further-reaching beam which uses more battery life and increases the risk of attracting zombies. The flashlight must be kept off for 30 seconds to recharge, requiring that its use be planned. Zombi has only the solo campaign, without local multiplayer or online single-player features. The boxed game was released on January 21, 2016.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nZombiU received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, with scores ranging from 4/10 given by GameSpot to 9.2/10 awarded by Official Nintendo Magazine. Although Montpellier was initially disappointed by some of the critical reviews, the studio was pleased with the game's overall reception.Jim Sterling of Destructoid wrote that ZombiU's zombies were intimidating by comparison with other zombie games. Sterling called it an \"oppressive\" experience, since players were diverted by the GamePad while the game continued in real time. This was echoed by Rich Stanton of Eurogamer, who thought that the system made the game experience scarier. According to Stanton, it was one of the few zombie titles which lived up to the phrase \"survival horror\". Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar agreed, saying that ZombiU \"[honed] in on the 'survival' part of the 'survival horror' genre better than any release in recent memory\". Patrick Klepek of Giant Bomb wrote that the game had some very scary moments, which players who liked survival horror would enjoy. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq praised its atmosphere, which he compared favourably with Condemned: Criminal Origins. Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com agreed, calling its atmosphere \"authentic\" and \"rich\". However, Schilling found the later stages of the game disappointing as the game become less frightening with the introduction of more-powerful weapons.Sterling wrote that the permadeath system makes the game feel scarier, saying that the emotional impact on players is more significant than the typical game over screen; the former player character could be considered a \"mute monument\" to player failure. According to Klepek, seeing a player character becomes a zombie was depressing and \"soul-crushing\". Arthur Gies of Polygon wrote that the system helped create an \"overwhelming sense of fear and risk\", and made him play the game in a more careful, tactical manner. Stanton wrote that the system often leads to \"fraught backpack hunts\", since players must retrieve their items from the previous player character; if they die, the items would be lost forever. According to Stanton, the system makes the game's items more meaningful and backtracking more fun. Greg Miller of IGN found the game paradoxically cool and nonsensical.Sterling called the plot \"typical\", writing that it was a basic backstory to complement the game's survival theme. Miller agreed, saying that ZombiU did not require a strong narrative. Stanton found the game's narrative not particularly engaging, but the environmental storytelling was \"skillfully done\". Turi found its concept interesting, but was disappointed with the lack of a central character and the game's excessive backtracking. Cooper called the story \"light\", but too complicated by the end; he was dissatisfied with the lack of interesting characters. Gies appreciated the game world's development, praising Ubisoft for creating a believable setting; however, he and Schilling were disappointed by the story's supernatural elements.\n\nSterling wrote that there was too little enemy variety, which made the game's combat repetitive. He also criticized its map design, saying that in his 11-hour experience with the game, he could not find his way to objectives for at least two hours. Turi called the game's map confusing, agreeing with Sterling that players would easily get lost. He criticized the game's melee weapon as unsatisfying to use, comparing it unfavorably to Dead Island and Left 4 Dead 2. According to Turi, the melee-combat shortcomings were highlighted by the game's shortage of ammunition. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot and Miller shared similar concerns, calling the melee combat repetitive. According to McGee, the game's simplistic mission design and puzzle offer little variety. Stanton wrote that although the game's combat was simple, it developed into \"something special\" since players needed to choose their weapons wisely. Cooper found several flaws in the systems, such as characters not acknowledging the death of a previous player character and forcing players to replay some game segments. Klepek found the gunplay to be mediocre, but thematically correct.Sterling found the use of the Wii U GamePad \"hit-and-miss\", stating that the scanning and radar functions are enjoyable. He noted that he was annoyed by the lock-picking and barricading minigames, which required players to press the touchscreen rapidly. According to Sterling, the latter two functions were pointless filler. Stanton praised the scanning system for immersing players in the game. Turi found the two-screen experience a noble effort, but was dissatisfied with its controls. According to McGee, the GamePad adds little to the game and some of its functions are better handled with a controller. Klepek called most of GamePad features well-implemented with the exception of the gyroscope controls. Mitchell wrote that the GamePad enhanced the overall gameplay, but disliked the screen-taping minigame in certain GamePad features.Sterling compared its graphics to a Wii title and noted technical flaws, including glitches and slow loading times. He and Stanton thought that some of the game's assets were used excessively. Turi severely criticized the game's lighting system, saying that it looked blurry even given its nighttime setting. Miller also noted the game's sub-par texture, and was disappointed by its lack of visual appeal. Turi and Gies noted the difficulty of dragging items with the GamePad, but Gies thought it added tension to the game.Sterling called the multiplayer mode King of Zombie being fun to play; playing as King Boris was more enjoyable than playing a zombie survivor. Turi echoed him, noting that a player should only play as a human survivor with a Pro Controller; playing with the nunchuck was \"unbearable\". McGee enjoyed this mode more than the single-player campaign for its action. Cooper liked the mode, but felt that the lack of online multiplayer limited its longevity. Klepek also liked the mode's concept but called the two-player mode a bit limited and not sufficiently enjoyable, a sentiment shared by Mitchell. Schilling thought the mode offered only \"brief entertainment\" and was an \"afterthought\".The game's Zombi version also received mixed reviews, according to Metacritic. Christopher Livingston of PC Gamer noted that the PC version had many glitches and occasionally crashed. Shabana Arif of GamesRadar found the system unrefined and repetitive, even with new melee weapons. Disappointed with the lack of enhancement of the original game's graphics, the limited 30 frames per second and the GamePad transition to other home consoles, she called the package a wasted opportunity. James Orry of VideoGamer.com also criticized the lack of visual upgrading and overall improvement and the exclusion of the multiplayer mode, but found the game \"an excellent entry in the survival horror genre\".\n\n\n=== Sales and legacy ===\nZombiU was the 17th-bestselling game in the UK in its first week of release, the bestselling third-party Wii U launch title. The game was unprofitable for Ubisoft, and a sequel (which would have had cooperative multiplayer and levels with multiple paths) was cancelled. ZombiU helped shape the asynchronous gameplay of Ubisoft's 2014 game, Watch Dogs; its disappointing sales prompted Ubisoft to turn Rayman Legends (an announced 2013 Wii-U exclusive) into a multi-platform game to reach a larger audience.\n\n\n== See also ==\nZombi, an adventure game released as Ubisoft's first title in 1986\nList of horror video games\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Saint Roch or Rocco  (lived c. 1348 \u2013 15/16 August 1376/79 (traditionally c. 1295 \u2013 16 August 1327) was a Catholic saint, a confessor whose death is commemorated on 16 August and 9 September in Italy; he is specially invoked against the plague. He may also be called Rock in English, and has the designation of St Rollox in Glasgow, Scotland, said to be a corruption of St Roch's Loch, which referred to a small loch once near a chapel dedicated to St. Roch in 1506.He is a patron saint of dogs, invalids, of falsely accused people, bachelors, and several other things. He is the patron saint of Dolo (near Venice) and Parma.\nHe is also the patron of Casamassima, Cisterna di Latina and Palagiano, Italy.Saint Roch is known as \"S\u00e3o Roque\" in Portuguese and as \"San Roque\" in Spanish, including in many now-English-speaking areas, such as the Philippines.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSaint Roch is given different names in various languages:\n\nAlbanian: Sh\u00ebn Rroku\nArabic: \u0631\u0648\u0643\u0632\u200e\nCatalan/Valencian: Roc\nCroatian: Rok or Roko\nCzech: Roch\nDutch: Rochus\nEnglish: Rock or Roch\nFilipino: Roque\nFrench: Roch\nGerman: Rochus\nGreek: \u03a1\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (Rokkos)\nHungarian: R\u00f3kus\nIcelandic: Rokkus\nItalian: Rocco\nLatin: Rochus\nLatvian: Rohs\nLithuanian: Rokas\nMalayalam: \u0d31\u0d4b\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3f (Rockey)\nMaltese: Rokku\nOccitan: R\u00f2c\nPolish: Roch\nPortuguese: Roque\nRomanian: Rochus\nSlovak: Roch or Rochus\nSlovene: Rok\nScots: Rollox\nSinhala: \u0dc1\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad \u0dbb\u0ddd\u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dca (Santha Rogus)\nSpanish: Roque\nTamil: Arockiya Nathar\nSwedish: Rochus\nUkrainian: \u0420\u043e\u0445 (Rokh)\n\n\n== Traditional biography ==\n\nAccording to his Acta and his vita in the Golden Legend, he was born at Montpellier, at that time \"upon the border of France,\" as the Golden Legend has it, the son of the noble governor of that city. Even his birth was accounted a miracle, for his noble mother had been barren until she prayed to the Virgin Mary. Miraculously marked from birth with a red cross on his breast that grew as he did, he early began to manifest strict asceticism and great devoutness; on days when his \"devout mother fasted twice in the week, and the blessed child Rocke abstained him twice also, when his mother fasted in the week, and would suck his mother but once that day.\"On the death of his parents in his twentieth year he distributed all his worldly goods among the poor like Francis of Assisi\u2014though his father on his deathbed had ordained him governor of Montpellier\u2014and set out as a mendicant pilgrim for Rome. Coming into Italy during an epidemic of plague, he was very diligent in tending the sick in the public hospitals at Acquapendente, Cesena, Rimini, Novara, and Rome, and is said to have effected many miraculous cures by prayer and the sign of the cross and the touch of his hand. At Rome, according to the Golden Legend he preserved the \"cardinal of Angleria in Lombardy\" by making the mark of the cross on his forehead, which miraculously remained. Ministering at Piacenza he himself finally fell ill. He was expelled from the town; and withdrew into the forest, where he made himself a hut of boughs and leaves, which was miraculously supplied with water by a spring that arose in the place; he would have perished had not a dog belonging to a nobleman named Gothard Palastrelli supplied him with bread and licked his wounds, healing them. Count Gothard, following his hunting dog that carried the bread, discovered Saint Roch and became his acolyte.\nOn his return incognito to Montpellier he was arrested as a spy (by orders of his own uncle) and thrown into prison, where he languished five years and died on 16 August 1327, without revealing his name, to avoid worldly glory. (Evidence suggests, as mentioned earlier, that the previous events occurred, instead at Voghera in the 1370s.)\n\nAfter his death, according to the Golden Legend;anon an angel brought from heaven a table divinely written with letters of gold into the prison, which he laid under the head of S. Rocke. And in that table was written that God had granted to him his prayer, that is to wit, that who that calleth meekly to S. Rocke he shall not be hurt with any hurt of pestilence\nThe townspeople recognized him as well by his birthmark; he was soon canonized in the popular mind, and a great church erected in veneration.\nThe date (1327) asserted by Francesco Diedo for Saint Roch's death would precede the traumatic advent of the Black Death in Europe (1347\u201349) after long centuries of absence, for which a rich iconography of the plague, its victims and its protective saints was soon developed, in which the iconography of Roche finds its historical place: previously the topos did not exist. In contrast, however, St. Roch of Montpellier cannot be dismissed based on dates of a specific plague event. In medieval times, the term \"plague\" was used to indicate a whole array of illnesses and epidemics.The first literary account is an undated Acta that is labeled, by comparison with the longer, elaborated accounts that were to follow, Acta Breviora, which relies almost entirely on standardized hagiographic topoi to celebrate and promote the cult of Roch.The story that when the Council of Constance was threatened with plague in 1414, public processions and prayers for the intercession of Roch were ordered, and the outbreak ceased, is provided by Francesco Diedo, the Venetian governor of Brescia, in his Vita Sancti Rochi, 1478. The cult of Roch gained momentum during the bubonic plague that passed through northern Italy in 1477\u201379.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\n\nHis popularity, originally in central and northern Italy and at Montpellier, spread through Spain, France, Lebanon, the Low Countries, Brazil and Germany, where he was often interpolated into the roster of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, whose veneration spread in the wake of the Black Death. The 16th-century Scuola Grande di San Rocco and the adjacent church of San Rocco were dedicated to him by a confraternity at Venice, where his body was said to have been surreptitiously translated and was triumphantly inaugurated in 1485; the Scuola Grande is famous for its sequence of paintings by Tintoretto, who painted St. Roch in glory in a ceiling canvas (1564).\n\nWe know for certain that the body of St. Roch was carried from Voghera, instead of Montpellier as previously thought, to Venice in 1485. Pope Alexander VI (1492\u20131503) built a church and a hospital in his honor. Pope Paul III (1534\u20131549) instituted a confraternity of St. Roch. This was raised to an arch-confraternity in 1556 by Pope Paul IV; it still thrives today. Saint Roch had not been officially recognized as yet, however. In 1590 the Venetian ambassador at Rome reported back to the Serenissima that he had been repeatedly urged to present the witnesses and documentation of the life and miracles of San Rocco, already deeply entrenched in the Venetian life, because Pope Sixtus V \"is strong in his opinion either to canonize him or else to remove him from the ranks of the saints;\" the ambassador had warned a cardinal of the general scandal that would result if the widely venerated San Rocco were impugned as an impostor. Sixtus did not pursue the matter but left it to later popes to proceed with the canonization process. His successor, Pope Gregory XIV (1590\u20131591), added Roch of Montpellier, who had already been memorialized in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass for two centuries, to the Roman Catholic Church Martyrology, thereby fixing August 16 as his universal feast day.Numerous brotherhoods have been instituted in his honor. He is usually represented in the garb of a pilgrim, often lifting his tunic to demonstrate the plague sore, or bubo, in his thigh, and accompanied by a dog carrying a loaf in its mouth. The Third Order of Saint Francis, by tradition, claims him as a member and includes his feast on its own calendar of saints, observing it on August 17.\n\n\n== Saint Roch in art ==\n\nFollowing the Black Death, especially the Italian plague epidemic of 1477\u201379, new images of Christian martyrs and saints appeared and Saint Roch gained new fame and popularity. The religious art of the time emphasized the importance of the saint to plague-ridden Christians.\nThe new plague-related images of Saint Roch were drawn from a variety of sources. Plague texts dating from ancient and classical times, as well as Christian, scientific and folk beliefs, all contributed to this emerging visual tradition.  Some of the most popular symbols of plague were swords, darts, and most especially arrows.  There was also a prevalence of memento mori themes, dark clouds, and astrological signs (signa magna) such as comets, which were often referenced by physicians and writers of plague tracts as causes of plague. The physical symptoms of plague \u2013 a raised arm, a tilted head, or a collapsed body \u2013 began to symbolize plague in post-Black Death painting.Plague saints offered hope and healing before, during, and after times of plague.  A specific style of painting, the plague votive, was considered a talisman for warding off plague. It portrayed a particular saint as an intercessor between God and the person or persons who commissioned the painting \u2013 usually a town, government, lay confraternity, or religious order to atone for the \"collective guilt\" of the community.These plague votives worked as a psychological defense against disease in which people attempted to manipulate their situation through requesting the intercession of a saint against the arrows of plague.  Rather than a society depressed and resigned to repeated epidemics, these votives represent people taking positive steps to regain control over their environment. Paintings of St. Roch represent the confidence in which renaissance worshipers sought to access supernatural aid in overcoming the ravages of plague.\nThe very abundance of means by which people invoked the aid of the celestial court is essential in understanding Renaissance responses to the disease.  Rather than depression or resignation, people \"possessed a confidence that put even an apocalyptic disaster of the magnitude of the Black Death into perspective of God's secure and benevolent plan for humankind.\"The plague votives functioned both to request intercessory aid from plague saints and to provide catharsis for a population that had just witnessed the profound bodily destruction of the plague. By showing plague saints such as St. Roch and St. Sebastian, votives influenced the distribution of God's mercy by invoking the memory of the human suffering experienced by Christ during the Passion. In the art of St. Roch after 1477 the saint displayed the wounds of his martyrdom without evidence of pain or suffering. Roch actively lifted his clothing to display the plague bubo in his thigh. This display of his plague bubo showed that \"he welcomed his disease as a divinely sent opportunity to imitate the sufferings of Christ\u2026 [his] patient endurance [of the physical suffering of plague was] a form of martyrdom.\"Roch's status as a pilgrim who suffered plague is paramount in his iconography. \"The sight of Roch scarred by the plague yet alive and healthy must have been an emotionally-charged image of a promised cure. Here was literal proof that one could survive the plague, a saint who had triumphed over the disease in his own flesh.\"\n\n\n== Saint Roch in literature ==\nF. T. Prince published a long monologue from the perspective of Saint Roch's dog entitled 'His Dog and Pilgrim' in his 1983 collection Later On.\n\n\n== Saint Roch churches ==\n\n\n=== Asia Pacific ===\nSt Roch's Church, Puthenthurai, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India\nSt Roch Church, South Ramanathichen puthoor, Kanayakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India\nSt Roch Church, Vavathurai Kanyakumari,Tamil Nadu, India\nSt Roche's Church, Manickamangalam, Kalady, Ernakulam, Kerala, India\nSt Rocky's chapel, Kottamam-Kalady, Ernakulam, Kerala, India\nSt Rocky's Church, Areekara, Kottayam, Kerala, India\nSt.Rock's Church, Chelikere, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India\nSt Roque Parish Church, Neerude in Mangalore Diocese of India, Karnataka\nSt Rocky Church, Kovilakathumkadavu, Palliport, Vypin, Kerala, India\nSt Roch Church and Grotto, Pootharakkal, Kerala, India\nSt Roch's Church, Delatura, Ja-Ela, Sri Lanka\nSan Roque Parish, Bagumbayan, Quezon City, Philippines\nSan Roque de Alabang, Alabang Muntinlupa, Philippines\nSan Roque Roman Catholic Parish, Sulop, Davao del Sur, Philippines\nParokya ng San Roque, Brgy.

          "This is a small, but perfectly formed museum dedicated to Art Brut \u2013 art created by artists who have remained largely outside the mainstream art world. I\u2019m not sure there was a single artist whose name I recognised, and yet this was probably one of the most enjoyable couple of hours I have spent in any art gallery or museum anywhere in the world. The works on display are visually striking, bold, witty, macabre, childish, inventive, thought-provoking\u2026 I came away energised and inspired. Art Brut is sometimes translated as \u2018Outsider Art\u2019 or \u2018Folk Art\u2019 but having visited the museum, I think the French term (\u2018Art Brut\u2019 / \u2018Raw Art\u2019) actually comes closest to describing the collection. The thing that unites these artists is not whether they are \u2018outsiders\u2019 or \u2018folk artists\u2019 but the fact they each have such a singular vision of the world and a compulsion to make art on their own terms, no matter what the critical or commercial reaction. If you love art and design you will love this museum."

Noted for delicate light structures and permeable enclosures, Fujimoto designed several houses, and in 2013, was selected to design the temporary Serpentine Gallery pavilion in London.Fujimoto published a book in 2008 called Sou Fujimoto: Primitive Future.

        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

        "wiki": "The Hospital of the Holy Spirit (Italian: L'Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia) is an ancient and the oldest hospital in Europe, which is located in Rome, Italy, and works now as a convention center. The complex lies in rione Borgo, east of Vatican City and next to the modern Ospedale di Santo Spirito (which continues its tradition). The hospital was established on the site of the former Schola Saxonum, a part of the complex houses of the Museo Storico.\n\n\n== Premisse ==\n\n\n=== Christian brotherhood ===\nThe Christianity gave rise to a new philanthropic feeling in men, as evidenced by the words of Tertullian; \"We are like brothers by right of nature, our common Mother\". Tertullian himself railes against the pagans and their way of treating the sick, mostly left to their ungrateful fate. It is reasonable, therefore, to attribute the birth of hospitals to the push given by Christianity which, even in the darkness of the Catacombs, did not fail to \"be towards the most needy\". And so the feeling of love, charity, piety and concern for the sick received a healthy and lively impulse with the change of perspective offered by the Christian religion. This feeling finally turned into practice in 325 AD with the First Council of Nicaea in Bithynia where the 300 and more bishops gathered established that \"in every city houses are built called Xenodochi and hospices for pilgrims, for the poor and for the sick\". These dwellings were entrusted to the bishops of the various dioceses: each of them was considered \"father of the poor\" and in this regard we find in the Apostolic Constitutions \"O bishop, take care of the poor, as a minister of God, distributing to everyone the necessary time, to widows, orphans, derelicts, the sick and the unfortunate\". After the First Council of Nicaea the Church was strongly committed to the creation of brephotrophs for exposed infants, orphanages, gerontocomia for the non self-sufficient elderly, as well as Xenodochi and Nosocomi, for pilgrims.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From the Schola of the Saxons to the birth of the Hospital ===\n\nThe early edifice of the Hospital of Santo Spirito in Saxia was the Schola, erected by the King of Wessex Ine (689-726). At the beginning of the eight century the Schola had been conceived to host the Anglo-Saxon pilgrims visiting Rome, and in particular its innumerable holy places, like the tomb of Saint Peter. Bede wrote that \"Nobles and plebeians, men and women, warriors and artisans came from Britannia\". This pilgrimage lasted centuries; in that period Rome enjoyed such a fame that at least ten sovereigns are known to have come ad limina Apostolorum the first of them was C\u00e6dwalla, King of the Western Saxons (685-688). Following the foundation of the Schola, the whole quarter took an exotic character, so that it was known as the \"town of Saxons\"; even now the right bank of the Tiber is called Borgo (Italian for \"village\").\nAt the beginning of the pontificate of Leo IV, a violent fire - portrayed by Raphael in the fresco \"The Fire in the Borgo\" - devastated the quarter of the Saxons and also damaged the Scholae of the Frisians, the Lombards, the Franks and the Saxons themselves, coming to affect St. Peter's Basilica. Such an extended fire had to be malicious: it was probably set on by Saracens, penetrated up the river. Pope Leo IV looked after the reconstruction of the Church of Santa Maria in Saxia and of the Schola of the Saxons, in which many kings of Northern Europe, like Burgred of Mercia, or the Prince Alfred the Great, found rest after an exhausting journey.\nA prosperous period followed; but, due to historical events such as the Norman invasion of England in 1066 and the beginning of the Crusades, which routed the crowds of pilgrims towards other destinations, the institution declined and just maintained its name. Innocent III was the Pope who brought it back to the top, modifying it and making it one of the most famous hospitals in the world. Furthermore, on November 25, 1198 he approved and recommended the Order of the Hospitallers, through the bull \u201cReligiosam vitam\u201d, by which he welcomed Guy de Montpellier and the institution he had founded under the protection of the Vatican.\n\nIn order to protect and uphold the orphan children, Innocent III dedicated them a new institution, the renowned ruota degli esposti (\"baby hatch\"), where the abandoned children were left.\nSoon afterward Reginald, Bishop of Chartres, offered to the Hospital - at that time called Santa Maria in Saxia - a prebendary of his church. Thanks to the consecration of this new institution, Innocent III created a statute of rules for the Order of the Hospitallers, who was entrusted with the management and the safeguard of the Hospital, under the control of Guy de Montpellier.\nIn 1201 the same Pope endowed to the Hospital of Santa Maria the church with the same name and its incomes. This deed sanctioned the birth of the Venerable Roman Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Saxia, while the bordering church became a hospitality shelter. At the beginning of its existence, the new structure only consisted of a rectangular aisle enlightened by little windows, with a capacity of 300 patients and 600 indigents.\nThe Hospital received conspicuous donations, like the ones by the King of England John Lackland, who granted \"the donation of the Church of Wirtel and of its incomes as an endowment to the Hospital\", or the ones by the Pope himself, who erected new edifices alongside of the new institute and, starting from January 1208, granted to the new structure the privilege of \"Sacred Station\" on the Sunday following the eighth Epiphany, thus increasing the zeal of the faithful. The celebration was accompanied by a procession and a solemn ceremony, after which the Pope donated 3 dinars to the members of the Hospital and to 1000 poor men. It was a very important event, that gathered the people into the rising institute. The Pope pronounced a very significant homily, that began with the words taken from the Gospel of John: \"On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus\u2019 mother was there, and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding [...]\".The Roman Hospital was enlarged by many Popes and, century after century, it gained greatness and splendour, so that Pope Pius VI could proclaim it \"The throne of Catholic Charity\".\n\n\n=== Guy de Montpellier ===\nGuy de Montpellier is known as a knight templar, coming from the Montpellier family of the counts of Guillaume. He built in his native town an Hospital House, that rose in the area now called Pyla-Saint-Gely, and founded a regular order of Hospitallers Friars (1170), consecrated to give assistance to infirm, abandoned children and whoever needed help and cares. Documents dating back to the decade 1180-90 prove that the Hospital of Montpellier already had great importance, such as the new Hospitallers order. These documents show the existence of 6 Houses of the Holy Spirit all over France, following the model of Montpellier. By giving rise to the Holy Spirit organization, Guy wanted that \u201dthe assistance and care were free from the cold-heartedness of a paid service, and raised up to the degree of a sacred duty, deserving to be compared to the pureness of the Apostles and early Christianity age\u201d. The future Pope Innocent III, during his stay in France, had had the opportunity of admiring this effective institution and commented: \"Here the hungry are fed, the poor are dressed, the orphan children are fed, the infirm are rendered the necessities and all kind of consolation is given to the poor. Therefore The Master and the Friars of the Holy Spirit should not be called hosts of the poor, but their servants, and they are the real poor men, as they charitably share the necessity to the indigent\".As soon as he ascended the papal throne, Innocent III publicly celebrated the institution of the Houses of the Holy Spirit: \u201dThrough hard informations we know that the Hospital of the Holy Spirit, founded in Montpellier by our beloved son Friar Guy, shines over all the other hospitals in terms of Religion and practice of the greatest hospital charity, as all the ones that experienced it can testify\u201d. Innocent III esteemed Guy insomuch as to appoint him commissioner against the heretics in France. With the 1198 bull he confirmed the foundation of the Hospitallers and placed them under his protection, together with all the French branches and the ones that were rising in Rome, such as Santa Maria in Trastevere and Sant\u2019Agata on the Via Aurelia. The yearning of Guy was lucky enough to meet the thought of Innocent III. The Pope himself, in a letter to the bishops of France, proclaimed Guy as a \u201cGod-fearing man, dedicated to the good works\u201d.\n\n\n=== Arrival of Sixtus IV ===\n\nIn 1471 the Hospital suffered an imposing fire that led it to a crumbling condition. Sixtus IV (1471-1484), visiting the Hospital soon after his election, described it: \u201cthe falling walls, the narrow, gloomy  edifices, without air and whichever comfort, look like a place intended for the captivity rather than health recovery\u201d. He decided the immediate rebuilt, in view of the Jubilee of 1475. Thanks to Sixtus IV, the hospital enjoyed a real rebirth, thus becoming the most important place for scientific research: it hosted famous doctors, such as Giovanni Tiracorda, the personal doctor of Clement X, Lancisi and Baglivi, who conducted important medical projects. Furthermore, within the Antica Spezieria (Italian for \"Ancient Spicery\"), the use of quina bark was first experimented for the treatment of malaria.\nIn religious terms, the hospital could relish the presence of such personalities as St. Philip Neri and St. Camillus de Lellis. Finally, the importance of the Anatomical theatre can not be overlooked: it summoned such artists and scientists as Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Sandro Botticelli, who reproduced the fa\u00e7ade of the hospital in the background of the fresco \u201cJesus cleansing a leper\u201d.\n\n\n=== Former Rule of Santo Spirito ===\n\nThe Hospitaller Order is based on its Rule, consisting of 105 short chapters, many of which extensively recall the duties of former religious orders. Two examples of the Rule of Santo Spirito have been conserved: one is in the National Archive of Rome, the other in the archive of the hospital of Dijon, both dating back to the fifteenth century. This Rule is effectively appropriate to the hospital framework, pervaded with discipline and unselfishness, and thoroughly clarifies the progression of the everyday life in the hospital. It is especially noticeable that most of the chapters have the purpose to make the stay of the ill in the structure more comfortable and healthy. For instance, Chapter 1 says that all goods belong to everybody and that \"Nobody shall dare saying that a thing is his own\", while Chapter 15 says \"The spirit of charity shall be a constant rule\" and Chapter 33 contains scrupulous rules about clothing provision and orphans breeding.\n\n\n=== Hospitals of Santo Spirito between 12th and 13th centuries ===\nAt the end of the 12th century, two hospitals of the Order of Santo Spirito worked in Rome: the first one was the subject of this item, while the second one rose close to the Church of Sant\u2019Agata, at the door of the town; another hospital of the same Order rose in the same century close to the church of San Biagio in Orte. At the end of the 13th century the Hospitals of Santo Spirito amounted about to a hundred, the majority of which in Lazio, but also in Umbria, Abruzzo, Marche, Tuscany and Kingdom of Naples. The most famous and important ones, besides the mother house in Rome, were the ones in Florence, Milan, Foligno, Pozzuoli and Viterbo.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nSince 2000 the monumental complex has become one of the congress centres of Rome and is managed by Giubilarte s.r.l. It houses conventions, gala dinners, fashion shows and art exhibitions.\nThe complex of Santo Spirito in Sassia belongs to the association \"Historic Conference Centres of Europe\" and is a supporting member of the Healthcare Convention and Exhibitors Association.\n\n\n== Complex ==\n\n\n=== Corsia Sistina ===\n\nThe Corsia Sistina (Italian for \"Sixtine Aisle\"), erected for the will of Sixtus IV after grieves, sacks and fires, is the main building of the hospital. Surmounted by an octagonal tower, the Corsia is an immense hall, 340 ft long and 40 ft wide, divided into two sections separated by a lantern: the two rooms were called \"Lower Wing\" and \"Upper Wing\". The lantern, that puts the rooms into contact, has two levels: on the outer side it shows two- and three-mullioned windows, ascribed to the architect Giovanni Pietro Ghirlanducci from Parma, while the internal side is decorated with shell-shaped niches, housing statues of the Apostles, and barrel-vaulted intradosses with coffers, arguably due to the florentine architect and \u00e9b\u00e9niste Giovannino de' Dolci. In the middle of the lantern rises an altar, probably the only Roman work by Andrea Palladio; behind the altar formerly there was a pipe organ, whose music gladdened the ill during their stay. In the prostyle of the lantern there is one of the two main entrances of the ancient Sixtine hospital; it has a double gate: the inner one, called \"Gate of Paradise\", is ascribed to Andrea Bregno. Close to the gate of Bregno there is the ruota degli esposti (baby hatch), created by Innocent III for the reception of the orphans. The other entrance of the hospital, portrayed by Sandro Botticelli into a fresco of the Sistine Chapel, is preceded by a large portico with octagonal pillars.\n\nIn 1478, the walls of the Corsia were frescoed with a frieze made by more than fifty scenes, depicting the origins of the hospital of Innocent III and the most important episodes of the life of Sixtus IV. The fresco was painted by artists of the so-called \"Umbro-Roman School\", such as Melozzo da Forl\u00ec, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pinturicchio and Antoniazzo Romano.\nThe cycle of the frescoes, depicting the origin of the hospital and a few episodes about Innocent III, starts from the east wall and continues till the south wall; here starts the depiction of the life and deeds of Sixtus IV. The most important episodes include the killing of the kids thrown into the Tiber, the dream of Innocent III and the fishermen showing kids corpses to Innocent III. The dream described in the fresco was the one that persuaded Innocent III to found the Schola of the Saxons, the former seat of the Hospital.\nThe complex of the Ospedale di Santo Spirito lies over an area that, in ancient Rome, was occupied by the villa of Agrippina the Elder (wife of Germanicus and mother of Caligula): in some rooms below the Corsia Sistina, remains of opus reticulatum walls, mosaic floors, carved marbles and frescoes are still visible.\n\n\n=== Cloisters of the Friars and of the Nuns ===\nAfter building the \"Lower Wing\" of the Corsia Sistina, Pope Sixtus IV erected two religious edifices at the service of the foundation, one for the friars and the other for the nuns. Both edifices overlook a rectangular cloister, bordered by a double loggia with arches resting on ionic columns; the refectory and the kitchen were in common. The two cloisters, though very similar at all appearances, nevertheless show subtle but substantial differences: the Cloister of the Nuns has an additional arch and shows the coat of arms of Sixtus IV on the transom of the doors and windows; the same coat of arms is also visible in the middle of the groin vaults in the corners. Furthermore, in 1479 some rooms within the edifice of the nuns were used as an hospice for the nobles and later for the nurses taking care of the abandoned children. In 1791 twelve columns of the Cloister of the Friars and ten columns of the Cloister of the Nuns were removed by the nephews of Pius VI, who re-employed them in the Honour Grand Staircase of Palazzo Braschi.\nIn the middle of both cloisters a fountain rises: the most important is the one in the Cloister of the Nuns, called \"Fountain of the Dolphins\", an example of refined 16th-century elegance, attributable to Baccio Pontelli.\nIn addition to the Cloisters of the Friars and of the Nuns, the hospital has a third cloister, located within the porticoes of the \"Ancient Conservatory\". This cloister is surrounded by a garden with a simple but elegant well in the middle.\n\n\n=== Palazzo del Commendatore ===\n \nPalazzo del Commendatore (Italian for \"Palace of the Knight Commander\"), a 16th-century enlargement of the complex, was erected under the pontificate of Pius V and dedicated to Monsignor Bernardino Cirillo, Commendatore from 1556 to 1575, regarded as one of the most famous Commendatori of the institute. The palace overlooks a quadrangular courtyard bordered by a double loggia with arches resting on doric columns in the lower loggia and on ionic columns in the upper one. The ceiling of the lower portico is a ribbed vault, the one of the upper portico is wooden; the area of the courtyard houses an impluvium, on the model of the houses in ancient Rome. The central arch of the lower loggia hosts a fountain erected by Paul V as a decoration for the Palace of the Vatican and later moved to the Palazzo del Commendatore by Alexander VII. The upper loggia, in correspondence to the fountain, shows a big clock surrounded by the coat of arms of the family of Cardinal Ludovico Gazzoli. The face of the clock is framed by the figure of a snake touching its own tail, symbol of eternity; on both sides there is a cross with two horizontal axes, symbol of the Holy Spirit.\n\nOn the left of the main entrance of the courtyard there is the door of the ancient Spezieria (spicery) of the Hospital, lately restored and still containing its wonderful and a rich collection of fine pictures.\nOn the right of the main entrance are the Accademia Lancisiana and the grand staircase, giving access to the first floor of the Palazzo and to the upper loggia, which shows a plaster impression of a low-relief by Antonio Canova depicting a lesson of anatomy. The walls of the upper loggia are entirely decorated with frescoes commissioned by Cardinal Teseo Aldrovandi to the painter Ercole Pelillo from Salerno; they show landscapes, panoplies and grotesques.\nThe loggia gives access, through a double doorway, to the Apartment of the Commendatore, consisting of many rooms decorated with magnificent tapestries, ancient furniture and sculptures, among which a Virgin with the Child by Andrea del Verrocchio. The most eminent room is the Gala Hall, called Salone del Commendatore; this room was interely frescoed by the brothers Jacopo and Francesco Zucchi, who portrayed the history of the Hospital, from the dream of Pope Innocent III, to Pope Sixtus IV visiting the building sites, up to the whole, diversified endeavour carried out by the Institution (see the paragraph Corsia Sistina). Each scene simulates a tapestry bordered by draperies, on which the coats of arms of Santo Spirito, with its typical \"Cross of Lorraine\", and of the Aldrovandi family are alternately represented. Finally, the corners of the room are decorated with pictures of festoons and fruits.\n\n\n=== Biblioteca Lancisiana ===\n\nThe Room of the Commendatore, as well as the upper loggia, give access to the Biblioteca Lancisiana, founded in 1711 by Giovanni Maria Lancisi, an eminent scholar and the doctor of Pope Innocent XI, who made this library the heart of his project for the promotion of scientific culture. \nThe library was inaugurated in 1714 in the presence of Pope Clement XI. It is composed of two large halls: the first one has an atrium and a vestibule; the second one, the former part of the library, has 16 wooden shelves. The collections of books comprise the Lancisi collection, made with books donated by the King of France Louis XIV, the Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo III and Prince F\u00fcrstenberg. The library also conserves 373 valued manuscripts from 14th to 20th century, among which two parchment codices with Latin translations of texts by Avicenna and the well-known Liber Fraternitatis Sancti Spiritus. A little window, located behind one of the walls of the library, opens up at the level of the frescoes of the Corsia Sistina: it allowed the various Commendatori who managed the Institute to hold in check the staff responsible for the ill assistance. In the middle of the main hall of the library there are two magnificent globes made in 1600.\n\n\n== Church ==\nThe complex includes the Church of Santo Spirito in Sassia.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nCitations\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlloisi, Sivigliano; Alloisi, Luisa Cardilli (2002).

        "wiki": "Valence (US: , French: [val\u0251\u0303s] (listen); Occitan: Valen\u00e7a [va\u02c8lens\u0254]) is a commune in southeastern France, the capital of the Dr\u00f4me department and within the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. It is situated on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne, about 100 kilometres (62 mi) south of Lyon, along the railway line that runs from Paris to Marseille.\nIt is the 5th largest city in the region by its population, with 62,481 registered inhabitants in 2012 (127,559 inhabitants in the agglomeration). The city of Valence is divided into four cantons. Its inhabitants are called Valentinois.Located in the heart of the Rhone corridor, Valence is often referred to as \"the door to the South of France\", the local saying \u00e0 Valence le Midi commence (\"at Valence the Midi begins\") pays tribute to the city's southern culture. Between Vercors and Provence, its geographical location attracts many tourists. Axes of transport and communications are the A7 and A49 autoroutes, the RN7, Paris/Marseille TGV line, as well as the Rh\u00f4ne. In addition, the Valence agglomeration is equipped with a marina, a trading port, two railway stations (Valence-Ville and Valence-TGV) and an airport. Its business is essentially turned towards the sectors of agriculture, metallurgy, engineering and electronics.The commune, founded in 121 BC, after the invasion of Gallia Narbonensis by the Romans, it moved quickly to become the largest crossroad behind Lyon. With its growing importance, Valence gained the status of Roman colony. Over the centuries, the town grew and grew. Today, many vestiges of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, but also from the 17th century, 18th century and 19th century are visible in the city centre. The city is historically attached to the Dauphin\u00e9, of which it forms the second largest city after Grenoble and is today part of the network of French Towns and Lands of Art and History. Formerly the duchy of Valentinois, it was ruled by the Duke of Valentinois, a title which is still claimed by the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, though he has no actual administrative control over the area.\nMonuments in Valence include the Maison des T\u00eates, built between 1528 and 1532 by Antoine de Dorne, the Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral, built between 1063 and 1099 under the leadership of Bishop Gontard and also the monumental fountain designed by the architect Eug\u00e8ne Poitoux. The city has many historical monuments, most of which are in Vieux Valence. Inscribed on the list of flowery towns and villages of France, Valence is one of the seventeen municipalities of the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region to be labeled \"four flowers\" by the Concours des villes et villages fleuris, i.e. the maximum level.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nBy its geographical location, Valence is one of the points of compulsory passage between Paris and the Mediterranean Sea. Its position at the centre of the meridian axis of the Rhone Valley places the city at the mouth of the Valley of the Is\u00e8re (path to the Alps), in the west of the historical province of Dauphin\u00e9, within the natural and historic region of the Valentinois, and the boundary of the department of Ard\u00e8che (from which it is separated by the Rh\u00f4ne). The city is surrounded by several mountain ranges, including the Massif Central and the Ard\u00e8che hills to the west, and the Vercors Massif in the French Prealps to the east. Valence is 561 kilometres (349 mi) to the southeast of Paris, equidistant (100 kilometres (62 mi)) south of Lyon and southwest of Grenoble, 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of Avignon, 220 kilometres (140 mi) north of Marseille, 204 kilometres (127 mi) north of Montpellier, 110 kilometres (68 mi) south-west of Saint-\u00c9tienne, 113 kilometres (70 mi) to the east of Le Puy-en-Velay, 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of Mont\u00e9limar, 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the east of Privas and 65 kilometres (40 mi) to the west of Die. Located a few kilometres south of the 45th parallel, the city is often referred to as the \"gateway to Southern France.\" \"\u00c0 Valence le Midi commence\" [At Valence the Midi commences], say people from the north.\n\nThe agglomeration is based on four alluvial terraces ranging on the left bank of the Rhone:\n\nThe lowest, which is closest to the river, where the districts of fishermen and sailors were.\nThe intermediate terrace, safe from the floods of the river, which grew into the historic city, first within its walls, then expanded outside.\nThe third terrace, highly urbanised in the second half of the 20th century.\nThe highest, called the plateau of Lautagne which has developed as a centre of technological activities since the end of the 20th century on the edge of grain and vegetable farms.Administratively, the commune is located in the south of the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, in the northern half of the Dr\u00f4me department (of which it is the prefecture), and in the south-west of the Arrondissement of Valence (of which it is the capital). Moreover, Valence is the chef-lieu of four cantons, Valence-1, Valence-2, Valence-3 and Valence-4, the city is therefore divided into four at the cantonal level. The commune is part of the Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration Valence Romans Agglo, which includes 56 communes since its inception on 1 January 2017, and Valence is the most populous city. Valence was previously part of two intercommunalities: SISAV (Intercommunal Union of Services of the Valentinoise Agglomeration, better known under the name of \"Valence Major\") which includes seven Dr\u00f4me and Ard\u00e8che communes (Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence, Cornas, Guilherand-Granges, Portes-l\u00e8s-Valence, Saint-Marcel-l\u00e8s-Valence, Saint-P\u00e9ray and Valence) from 1990 to 2009, and of the agglomeration community of Valence Agglo \u2013 Sud Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes which consisted of eleven communes from 2009 to 2014.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring Communes ===\n\n\n=== Relief and geology ===\n\nThe area of the commune is 3,669 hectares (9,070 acres), representing 36.69 square kilometres (14.17 sq mi); the altitude varies between 106\u2013191 metres (348\u2013627 ft).The granitic base, cut by the Rh\u00f4ne in the Saint-Vallier/Tain-l'Hermitage pass, is covered by 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) of sediments in the Valence trough. In the Miocene, a molasse formed of detrital rocks due to the erosion of the Alps and the Massif Central, was deposited in a shallow sea. Its thickness can reach 400\u2013500 metres (1,300\u20131,600 ft). During the Pliocene, the sea was reduced into a lake, resulting in lacustrine deposits and loess formation. During the Quaternary, between glacial periods, moraines were swept away by the meltwater in the interglacial stages and were carved by the rivers. Thus, nested terraces were formed. These nested terraces of Is\u00e8re and Rh\u00f4ne eventually filled the gap of Valence.\nThe Dr\u00f4me des Collines, which integrates Valence, formed at the end of the Miocene. Under the effect of the Alpine thrust, the area was covered by a lake and fluvio-lacustrine molasse formed with a few ripples in the plain of Valence. The confluence of the Is\u00e8re and Rh\u00f4ne and fluvial erosion caused by their waters, in the Quaternary, formed four superimposed terraces which are located in Valence.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nValence is watered by the Rh\u00f4ne river, the commune is on the left bank. One of its tributaries also crosses the city: The \u00c9pervi\u00e8re, a 2.6 kilometres (1.6 mi)-long river, formed by the joining of most of the city's channels, among others.\n\n\n=== Plain of Valence ===\n\nThe city gave its name to a well-defined geographical region: The Valentinois. Over more than three-quarters of its territory, this region corresponds to the plain of Valence, shaped by successive beds of the Rh\u00f4ne which are abandoned fertile sedimentary deposits. Indeed, this plain, perfectly bounded by the Rh\u00f4ne Valleys to the west, the Is\u00e8re in the north, and the Drome to the south, gives the appearance of a cheerful orchard with peach, apricot and cherry trees, alternating with cereal and vegetable crops. Large farms, conquered one by one by the inhabitants of Valence, punctuate this agricultural area, barely broken by rivers and canals for irrigation, with groves and woods on its margins.\nTo the east, the Monts du Matin extend as a long barrier of pleasant hills, dominated by the limestone prow of the Vercors. To the south, beyond the Dr\u00f4me Valley, the plain ends at the foot of the massif carrying the vast forest of Marsanne, topped by wind turbines.\nTo the north, beyond the Is\u00e8re Valley, the Romanais continues, geologically, Valence plain. The lower Miocene molasse in the north of the plain was covered by outwash alluvium of the Is\u00e8re, whose terraces today still mark the shape of the Valentinois.\nThe view from the ruins of the Ch\u00e2teau de Crussol, in front after the first sharp turns in the road on leaving the Col des Limouches, the plain of Valence appears as it is, a large flat surface, bordered by two reliefs which are unobscured. It is also a very large area because of the same formation of physical organisation, one of successive terraces. Only the habitat and crops bring variation, due to the different nature of these terraces.\nToday the plain of Valence is organised around the Valence infrastructure whose urban sprawl gradually extends across its whole area. A number of communes however retain their village identity and their rural character, protecting them from changing into dormitory towns. These are ancient agricultural villages, especially those that precede the first villages on the side of Vercors. Their names evoke an initial high placement to readily give a defensive view of the plain of Valence: Mont\u00e9lier, Montvendre, Mont\u00e9l\u00e9ger, Montoison, Montmeyran and Beaumont-l\u00e8s-Valence.\nHowever, the territories corresponding to the plain of Valence and the Valentinois do not include west of the agglomeration, which is located in the neighbouring department of Ard\u00e8che.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nValence enjoys a humid subtropical climate, whose main characteristic is an almost constant wind which blows and dries the Rh\u00f4ne corridor. Dubbed the \"mistral\" when it comes from the north, it brings good weather and coolness in the summer, but an impression of freezing cold in winter. When it comes from the south, it usually announces the arrival of stormy disturbances. It is then called le vent du midi ou le vent des fous [the midi wind or the uncaring wind] because, for some people, it makes the atmosphere painful to bear, especially in the summer.\nThe climate is semi-continental with Mediterranean influences. The Gotheron weather station of Saint-Marcel-l\u00e8s-Valence, located 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the centre of Valence, recorded an average temperature of 12.3 \u00b0C and 886 millimetres (34.9 in) of precipitation over the period from 1966 to 2004. The annual sunshine in Valence is 2,500 hours/year (average 1970\u20131994). However, there are large variations from one year to another, depending on the dominant influence (in turn Mediterranean and semi-continental). During the period from 1994 to 2004, the following years were remarkable: Lack of sunshine in 1996 (1,712 hours), low precipitation (572 millimetres (22.5 in)) and high temperatures in 1997, significant rainfall in 1999 (1,049 millimetres (41.3 in)) and in 2002 (1,257 millimetres (49.5 in)). There was significant sunshine (approx. 2,500 hours) from 1999 to 2002, accompanied by higher than average temperatures. Frost in April 2003 which affected peach production, followed by a summer heatwave in 2003, with exceptional sunshine for the year (2,781 hours), and a rainfall deficit in 2004 (722 millimetres (28.4 in)).Valence is located in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley where the wind regime is regular, both from the south (mistral) and north. Adding in the course of the Rh\u00f4ne which is linear from Lyon to Valence, this circumstance has allowed navigable sailing on the Rh\u00f4ne from Valence.\n\n\n=== Vegetation ===\nThe vegetation in the plain of Valence is mid-European with a supra-Mediterranean floor (pedunculate oak, oak found in the coldest places, and thickets of hornbeam) mingled with thermophilic species such as downy oak, or even evergreen oaks on exposed slopes with draining soils. Found also in the south of the Dr\u00f4me Valley where the Mediterranean influence finally prevails (20 kilometres (12 mi) to the South) are spontaneous populations of thyme, lavender, Euphorbia characias, Spanish broom (Genista hispanica), cane of Provence (Arundo donax), as well as Aleppo pines on the western face of the massif of Crussol. Due to the exposure and the nature of the soil, the Ard\u00e8che hills offer landscapes of garrigue and Mediterranean Oak (Quercus Ilex) from Tournon which is located 22 kilometres (14 mi) north of Valence (hills of Cornas, Ch\u00e2teau de Crussol and Soyons). The hills (mostly limestone) have a double vegetation: Mediterranean on the southern side and Sub-continental on the northern side.\nFormerly, the cultivation of olive trees was previously on the well-exposed heights of Tain-l'Hermitage (19 kilometres (12 mi) to the north), but they were replaced by the culture of the vine at first, and then by that of apricot, peach and other fruits which are still very present in the region, even though more than 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) of fruits (mainly apricots, cherries, peaches and kiwis) disappeared from the Dr\u00f4me landscapes due to an outbreak of sharka and a bacterial infection forcing wilt since 2003.\n\n\n== Communication and transport ==\nThe central railway station of Valence is the Gare de Valence-Ville, located just south of the town centre. The station offers connections to Lyon, Grenoble, Avignon, Gap and several regional destinations. In 2001 the Gare de Valence TGV opened along with the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, a high-speed rail line extending south from Valence to Marseille. The station is only 1 kilometre (1 mi) south of the end of the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, giving Valence much shorter journey times to northern destinations as well, with a journey to Paris taking 2h11. The TGV station is located 10 km northeast of the town.\nA bikesharing scheme called Lib\u00e9lo started in March 2010, offering 200 bicycles for long-term hire and 180 for short-term hire, in 18 locations around the city. Charges are collected by smart card or credit card.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\n\nThe city occupies a key position, at the centre of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley. Located on a crossroads of road networks, it is known to be a point of passage (cf. the Valence Autoroute Area) of the holidaymakers who head to the C\u00f4te d'Azur. The A7 autoroute (commonly known as the autoroute du soleil [motorway of the sun]) connects it to Lyon (100 kilometres (62 mi) to the north), Avignon (120 kilometres (75 mi) to the south), then to Marseille (220 kilometres (140 mi) south). The A49 autoroute connects it to Grenoble (95 kilometres (59 mi) to the northeast). The A41 autoroute connects it to Savoy (Chamb\u00e9ry and Annecy; 158 kilometres (98 mi) and 206 kilometres (128 mi) respectively) and Geneva (Switzerland) 245 kilometres (152 mi) to the northeast (via the A49).\nOn the other hand, relations with the cities of the Massif Central (Le Puy-en-Velay and Clermont-Ferrand) are more difficult as the roads are very winding. For example, the shortest route to reach Saint-\u00c9tienne passes through the Col de la R\u00e9publique (ex-RN 82) at 1,161 metres (3,809 ft) altitude.\n\n\n==== Underground project of the A7 ====\n\nIn Valence, the A7 autoroute runs along the Rh\u00f4ne and thus crosses the city by cutting the river. An underground project of the autoroute up to the city is being studied.The city of Valence was cut off from its river during the construction of the A7 motorway in the 1960s. The idea is born to bury the fast axis semi-covered trenches over a distance of about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi). This project to bury the motorway should make the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne available to Valence. However, the project would not be completed prior to at least 2025. The studies, which will be soon carried out, should enable a decision on the exact length of motorway involved, the technical choices and the financial cost. According to a preliminary study, the construction costs should culminate in an amount of \u20ac500 million, of which the cost will be shared between the State, the company Vinci Autoroutes, the department of Dr\u00f4me and the city of Valence.\n\n\n==== Valence ring road ====\n\nThe p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (ring road) of Valence consists of the A7 autoroute, Route nationale 7 and the Route nationale 532. It is located on the European routes E15 (A7) and E713 (RN 532).\nForming a half-loop, the Valence ring road covers a little more than 22 kilometres (14 mi) and connects the commune of Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence to the north (up to the toll of Valence Nord) in the city quarter of Fontlozier to the south (to the toll of Valence Sud exit), thus bypassing the major part of the city whilst ensuring the city is served to the east. It also allows easy access to the Valence TGV station in the north, by the RN 532. The ring road of Valence features motorway except in two singular points. The portion of the A7 autoroute in the centre is the legacy of the 1960s when the city turned back to its river. It is even doubled by urban roads, the D2007N.\nPlans to form a complete loop, connecting the current ring road to a western bypass of Valence, on the right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne, are under consideration. The east ring road is of more recent design and it ensures the continuity of the RN 7, which offers a free alternative to the A7. This section also provides the extension of the A49 autoroute right to Valence. A road-doubling project of the A7 and A49 autoroutes was considered to relieve the ring road of its transit traffic but was abandoned, even though this axis was granted to the society of the Autoroutes du Sud de la France (ASF) and acquisitions had been completed.\nThe west bypass is gradually emerging and it relates directly to the department of Ard\u00e8che. It is materialised by a second bridge (L\u00f4nes Bridge) on the Rh\u00f4ne (D 96 and D 534) coming to relieve the Mistral Bridge located in the city centre. This bypass is to develop because it is located in the core trunk with the D86, the main axis of the right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne. The bypass of the communes of Guilherand-Granges, Saint-P\u00e9ray and Cornas is programmed, which ensures its realisation by 2025. It will then require the construction of a third bridge over the Rh\u00f4ne in the north of the metropolitan area (in Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence) to complete the ring road that will then form a complete loop: This project is at the stage of preliminary studies and it seems that a passage on the present dam of the CNR is retained in order to minimise the cost.\n\n\n=== The bridges of Valence ===\n\nDuring antiquity, the existence of a bridge providing, as in Vienne, the link between the two shores, is likely. Indeed, as early as 1388, the toponym \"Pont P\u00e9ri\" [P\u00e9ri Bridge] is carried by a sector of the quarter of Basse-Ville lying in the extension of the east-west axis of the ancient city. In addition, A. Blanc would have discovered, still in this same extension, piles of oak, closer perhaps to a pier. He also mentioned the \"tour de Constance\" [Constance Tower], on the Valence shore, a construction already known in the Middle Ages and which bore all the floods of the Rh\u00f4ne. In any case, the existence of a link between the two banks is in no doubt and a crossing point could even have existed at the site of Valence from the prehistoric time. Whether or not that existed, this ancient bridge was not replaced until the nineteenth century.\nThe different successive bridges of Valence, in chronological order, are:\n\nThe Seguin Bridge built from 1827 (two years after that of Tain-Tournon, which was the first bridge of this type installed in France) and delivered to traffic in 1830.\nThe stone bridge, dating from 1905, destroyed 19 June 1940 by French engineers to slow the advance of the German troops. In August 1940, Rhone is again passable by boat and then a ferry to traille. A temporary Pigeaud bridge was then installed by the engineers. This bridge was again damaged on 18 August 1944 during a bombing by the Allied forces.\nA temporary suspended walkway installed in 1949 and which was in use until 1967.\nThe Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral Bridge, completed in 1967, is still in service. It joins the commune of Guilherand-Granges (Ard\u00e8che) to the city centre of Valence (Dr\u00f4me).\nFinally, the L\u00f4nes Bridge was inaugurated on 18 December 2004, located at the south of the city, is the \"second bridge\" of Valence, long expected to alleviate the problems of movement between the two banks of the Rhone. It connects the communes of Guilherand-Granges and Soyons (Ard\u00e8che) in the southern districts of Valence.During long periods where no bridge was available, a reaction ferry could cross the Rhone River. On the right bank, in Guilherand-Granges, an old pile used by this ferry is still erect.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe region has a bus network called Cit\u00e9a which covers the Valence agglomeration (located across the departments of Dr\u00f4me and Ard\u00e8che) and the romano-peageoise town (about 20 kilometres (12 mi) north of Valence). The network is managed by Valence Romans D\u00e9placements and controlled by the Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration Valence Romans Agglo and its operation is entrusted to VTV (V\u00e9olia Transport Valence) from 2012 (the former CTAV network to July 2006). Given the large extent of the Cit\u00e9a network, the latter is divided into two sectors, Valence and Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re.\nThe territory covered by the network is 1,037 square kilometres (400 sq mi). It consists of 64 communes located in and around the towns of Valence and Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re and is inhabited by nearly 220,000 people. Fourth urban network of the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, it has 20 regular lines, over 200 stops and a fleet of 220 bus.\nThe Oura! card is a transport document which consists of a smartcard which allows not only to travel on any Cit\u00e9a network (charging its transport tickets), but also to combine travel with other modes of transport in the region such as the TER Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes (Transport express r\u00e9gional), networks of transit of Saint Etienne (STAS), Grenoble (TAG) or Lyon (TCL), or even rent-a-bike in free service.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nValence has two SNCF railway stations. (Gare)\n\n\n==== Gare de Valence-Ville ====\n\nValence has two SNCF railway stations. Commissioned in 1865, the role of the Valence-Ville railway station has refocused on regional transport since the 2001 commissioning of the gare de Valence TGV, or simply Valence-TGV. It is the point of departure of the trains in the direction of Grenoble, Chamb\u00e9ry, Annecy and Geneva. Valence-Ville railway station was also the origin of the relationship which serves Livron, Crest, Die, Veynes-D\u00e9voluy, Gap, Embrun and Brian\u00e7on. The passenger building of Valence-Ville railway station has been in service in April 1866. It was designed by Louis-Jules Bouchot, architect of Napoleon III. The facade of the main body, in stone, is inspired by the Petit Trianon of Versailles. The main fa\u00e7ade on the Rue du Pavilion Central has been registered as an historic monument since 11 October 1982.\n\n\n==== Gare de Valence TGV ====\nValence TGV railway station, on the Lyon-Marseilles LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line, is located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) north-east of the city centre. Prior to its opening in 2001, the high speed TGV trains stopped in Valence-Ville railway station. Trains reached Paris in 2 hours 36 minutes. At the opening of the TGV station, a service of fifty TGVs per day was planned with eight of these TGVs continuing to serve Valence-Ville. Valence TGV station rail connections regularly connect to 35 cities, including Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Nice, Montpellier, Nantes, Le Havre, Reims, Avignon, Besan\u00e7on, Strasbourg, Dijon and Brussels. In 2003, 60 daily TGVs served the station, with 1.8 million passengers. In 2008, the station was served by 58 daily TGVs, carrying 2.2 million passengers.\n\n\n=== Inland waterway ===\n\nThe Port de l'\u00c9pervi\u00e8re contains 478 berths: It is the first river port of France. Built in 1973, at the initiative of the Chamber of commerce and industry of Dr\u00f4me (CCI of Dr\u00f4me), around a pool of 44,000 square metres (470,000 sq ft), it is included in a leisure park of 17 hectares (42 acres). The quality of the services offered allowed it to obtain the blue flag of Europe, in 2005.Created in 1978 and operated by the CCI of Dr\u00f4me, the river port of trade in the Dr\u00f4me (more often called Port of Valence) is located for its part, on the territory of the commune of Portes-l\u00e8s-Valence, just to the south of the city of Valence. It spread over 41 hectares (100 acres) and has in addition to the port itself, an industrial zone with 9 hectares (22 acres) of area of warehouses, including customs, a grain terminal, a 'wood' centre, and the storage sheds (7,600 square metres (82,000 sq ft) all products). Its strategic location on the Rh\u00f4ne (in the heart of the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, close to Is\u00e8re, Savoy and Switzerland) allows it to serve the countries of the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. As of July 2013, the Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne (CNR) began a campaign of work, with a cost of \u20ac14 million, to develop the port to make it a place of exchange at the European level.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nValence-Chabeuil Airport, located in the commune of Chabeuil, is co-managed by the General Council of the Dr\u00f4me and the Chamber of commerce and industry of Dr\u00f4me. It is open to commercial national traffic, to private aircraft, using IFR and VFR but welcomes more regular routes since the decision of the Valence-Paris service, which has run since 1969.\nThe airport has three runways: one of 2,100 metres (6,900 ft) in concrete, and two smaller, 1,300 metres (4,300 ft) and 440 metres (1,440 ft). The 530 square metres (5,700 sq ft) terminal has two gateways for access to aircraft. The aircraft parking area is 16,000 square metres (170,000 sq ft). Passengers have at their disposal a 150-space car park and a hotel area. A flying club, as well as a helicopter company are installed at the airport.Grenoble-Is\u00e8re Airport is located 80 kilometres (50 mi) north-east of Valence along the A49 and offers flights to several European cities including London, Bristol, Dublin, Rotterdam and Warsaw. Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport is 114 kilometres (71 mi) north of Valence via the A7 motorway and offers international flights. The airport is considered to be the second airport in the province after Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport and connects Lyon with most capitals and major European cities. More than 100 cities are connected one or more times a week, some up to five times per day, such as London. In 2013, the Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00e9ry airport processed more than 8.5 million passengers.\n\n\n=== Self-service bicycles ===\n\nSince 28 March 2010, the city has a system of self-service rent-a-bike and long-term hire called Lib\u00e9lo. It includes 160 bikes on the Smoove key concept spread over 18 then 20 stations and 200 rental bikes for long duration in Valence, Guilherand-Granges and Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence.\nUnlike most other bike sharing systems, its management is not delegated to a business, or related to an advertising market but provided by the transport company of Valence (subsidiary of Transdev) in partnership with the Cit\u00e9a transit network.\n\n\n== Urban planning ==\n\n\n=== Urban morphology ===\nThe old centre is based on the Roman foundation on a grid plan, occupation of the banks of the Rhone is sparse, probably because of instability. The orientation of the streets of the Roman city, orientation still quite widespread in the streets of the old town, is identical to those of the ancient cadastres of the surrounding countryside. The grid plan follows a dual orientation, varying neighbourhoods, the dual orientation which corresponds to two modules of this plan: One of about 360 Roman feet (107 metres (351 ft)), the other 420 feet, which sometimes breaks down into 120 feet spacing. This second module describes the angle of the Rue de l'\u00c9querre; Place des Ormeaux exactly a square actus (i.e. a square with a side of 120 Roman feet); the Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral occupies two square actus. The presence of the Roman amphitheatre near the Porte Neuve (New Gate) is detectable only in the design of the streets of the cadastre from 1807.The first alluvial terrace, at 120\u2013125 metres (394\u2013410 ft) altitude, was fully occupied by the western part of the communal territory in the 1960s. The city of Valence then expanded eastward, on the Riss terrace, at an altitude of approximately 150 metres (490 ft). To the south, the Lautagne plateau, at an altitude of 180 metres (590 ft), determines a narrow groove between this advance from the terrace of la L\u00e9ore and the Rh\u00f4ne, which has limited the development of the city in that direction. At the end of the 20th century, the city was again cut off from the Rh\u00f4ne by the construction of the A7 autoroute. Port areas are alone in the south towards Portes-l\u00e8s-Valence. The Valence agglomeration stretches on the right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne, but is limited by the edge of the Vivarais plateau. However, it includes the communes of Guilherand-Granges, Saint-P\u00e9ray, Cornas and Soyons.To facilitate the expansion of the town to the east, a large expressway was built (it is used by the RN7), where the Valence-Chabeuil Airport has been in operation since 1969.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\n\nThe city of Valence is made of twenty quarters (with an average of 3,500 people per quarter). They are all different from the other: The northern quarters are rather popular and residential (Polygone, Fontbarlettes, le Plan and la Chamberli\u00e8re) and even rural (Thodure), while the southern quarters are generally inhabited by the middle class and pensioners (Fontlozier, Hugo-Provence, Laprat, les Baumes, Mannet, Valence Sud and Lautagne), although there is a popular district (Valensolles), the central quarters are commercial and animated (Centre-ville, Gare, Victor Hugo) and also for tourists during the summer (Vieux Valence, Basse ville, l'\u00c9pervi\u00e8re) and the east quarters are areas with residential character (Baquet, Grand Charran, Petit Charran, Ch\u00e2teauvert, Danton and Briffaut), however the Martins quarter is rather rural.\nSome districts are represented by a \"Quarter Committee\", which makes for a very lively micro-local fabric. A Quarter Committee is an association of people who play a role with regard to public institutions, and who allow an exchange of information between people and municipal services. In this way, residents can participate in the direction of development projects of their quarters according to their aspirations.\nTo avoid a trip to the city hall, the city of Valence has created five city hall branches in outlying quarters. The mayoral branches of Fontbarlettes, le Plan, Centre-Ville, Valence Sud and the Chamberli\u00e8re are placed at the disposal of the inhabitants and are in charge of certain administrative services delegated by the Central Council.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\nIn 2009, the total number of dwellings in the municipality was 34,661, while it was 32,376 in 1999.Among this housing, 88.4% were primary residences, 1.0% of secondary residences and 10.6% vacant housing. These dwellings were 24.1% detached houses and 74.7% of apartments.The proportion of primary residences, as properties of their occupants, was 43.1%, up slightly from 1999 (41.1%). The share of social housing (empty rented HLM) was 16.5% against 18.8%, their number having dropped: 5,059 against 5,439.Concerning social housing, there are several organisations which are the Public Housing Office of Valence (OPH) and Housing Development of Dr\u00f4me (DAH) who construct, maintain and manage social housing throughout the city and in the Valence agglomeration, most are located in so-called working-class quarters. As for the grants of the OPH, they come from the city of Valence, the Dr\u00f4me department, the region and the State. Those of DAH come mainly from the department.\n\n\n=== Development projects ===\nThe major projects of the municipality do not yet concern the city centre, even if they have the merit of addressing the three terraces which line the city: the first terrace concerns Valence-le-Haut (quarters of le Plan and Fontbarlettes), the second concerns the centre and the south, and the third the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne.\nOne of the city's major projects is the reclamation of the banks, disfigured by the passage of the A7 motorway over 1.4 kilometres (0.87 mi). When he was Mayor of Valence, Member of Parliament Patrick Labaune had defended a bypass with an eastern route. Thus advocating the \"removal the A7\", when elected, specifically a burial of the motorway in semi-covered trenches. The project would have been validated by the company of the Autoroutes du Sud de la France (ASF), but the mayor refuses for now to give a price, which would be some \u20ac500 million according to experts.Other projects will be launched to create a 24 kilometres (15 mi) green route, on the banks, through the municipalities of Valence and Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence. In addition to a renovation of the tourist facilities on the site of the l'\u00c9pervi\u00e8re, the city wants to transform the \u00eeles quarter into an ecoquarter, with positive energy housing. This project could lead to the removal of family gardens there. However, there is a building plot and the gardens will be resettled on fertile lands of the plateau of Lautagne.\nLike the \u00eeles quarter, a new quarter is planned in the south of the city on the brownfield site of the Hugo-Provence area, in place of the former Cime building (destroyed in 2013), with the construction of 200 housing units (half social, half private), shops and a hotel. The first part should be delivered before 2015.One of the major issues of the municipality is the opening up of the Hauts-de-Valence, which is subject to a program of urban renewal of \u20ac117 million, jointly funded by the city and the National Agency for urban renewal (ANRU). It includes the demolition of 417 houses in the working-class districts of the Plan and Fontbarlettes and their reconstruction by the end of 2014 throughout the city. The project also includes an opening up and connection of these areas to the rest of the city. Shared public spaces will be created on Roosevelt and Kennedy boulevards.\nAt an estimated \u20ac100 million cost, the last big project supported by the city concerns the creation of a city of sports and culture on the former military wasteland of Latour-Maubourg. It will host the new Jean-Pommier pool, a municipal exhibition hall, a media hub with the headquarters of the radio station France Bleu Dr\u00f4me Ard\u00e8che and the Le Dauphin\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 newspaper, and finally a centre of higher education. The renovated buildings will house a students' halls, Maestris private school, nursing school and the regional school of fine arts of Valence, which has created a public establishment of cultural co-operation with that of Grenoble. In addition to the space of the wasteland, the city will have the land released by the relocation of the prison, in 2015. It has also launched a study to establish a new palais des congr\u00e8s in the area.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe demonym corresponding to Valence is Valentinois, but \"Valentinois\" also designates a geographical area, and one of the old provinces of France, with its capital Valence having been part of the province of Dauphin\u00e9.\n\nThe word valence comes from Latin valentia, meaning \"strength or capacity\". Known in Roman times as Valentia Julia, the city had been the capital of the Segalauni, and the seat of a celebrated school prior to the Roman conquest. It became a colony under Augustus, and was an important town of Viennensis Prima under Valentinian I. It was the seat of a bishopric perhaps as early as the 4th century.In the 5th century, control of Valentia passed from the Romans to the Alans and other barbarians: in 413, the Goths under Ataulf besieged and captured the brother of the usurper Jovinus, Sebastianus, at Valentia on behalf of the emperor Honorius. In 440, Alans led by Sambida were given deserted lands in Valentia by the Romans. Three years later, Aetius settled the Burgundians in the region, under King Gondioc which became part of the Kingdom of the Burgundians. His son, Chilperic II, ruled Valence from 473 to 493 when he was slain by his brother Gundobad. Chilperic's daughter Clotilde married Clovis, the King of the Franks, in 493. Clovis's son Childebert I attacked the Burgundians in 534, adding their territory to the Frankish Kingdom. The city then fell successively under the power of the Franks, the Arabs of Spain, the sovereigns of Arles, the emperors of Germany, the counts of Valentinois, the counts of Toulouse, as well as its own bishops, who struggled to retain the control of the city they had won in the fifth century. These bishops were often in conflict with the citizens and the counts of Valentinois and to strengthen their hands against the latter the pope in 1275 united their bishopric with that of Die.The citizens put themselves under the protection of the dauphin, and in 1456 had their rights and privileges confirmed by Louis XI and put on an equal footing with those of the rest of Dauphin\u00e9, the bishops consenting to recognize the suzerainty of the dauphin. In the 16th century Valence became the centre of Protestantism for the province in 1563. The town was fortified by King Francis I. It became the seat of a celebrated university in the middle of the 15th century; but the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 struck a fatal blow at its industry, commerce and population.\n\n\n=== Toponymy ===\nThe conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar made the Rh\u00f4ne corridor a major north-south communication axis, linking with the new Roman possessions around the Mediterranean Sea. Many settlements were founded, including Valentia, a Latin name meaning La Vaillante [brave], La Vigoureuse [strong], in the territory of the Segovellaunes.\nThe town named Valen\u00e7a in Occitan, Val\u00e8n\u00e7o in literary Proven\u00e7al and Valin\u00e7o in local Proven\u00e7al.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\n\n==== At the end of prehistory ====\n\nThe city of Massalia, long on good terms with Rome, asked it for help against the Salyes who had ravaged its territory. The intervention of the Romans, from 125 BC, assured its safety but the war continued against the Allobroges, among whom the Salyes people had found refuge. In August 121 BC, the army of Quintus Fabius Maximus crushed them at the Battle of the Confluence (implied, the Rh\u00f4ne and Is\u00e8re) according to Strabo (Geographica, IV, 1, 11).Orosius noted that Gaius Marius, who was sent by Rome to stop the Cimbri and the Teutons, had established his camp not far from the confluence of the Rh\u00f4ne and the Is\u00e8re. The excavations on the upper part of the plateau of Lautagne (2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) south of the centre of Valence) revealed the presence of devices of a defensive nature dating from the 1st century BC: Thus the foundation of the city could have come from a Roman military camp.Even under the Roman domination, the Allobroges tribe established themselves north of Is\u00e8re, and repeatedly rebelled against the Roman occupation. The Battle of Solonion was the last to take place, identifiable with the modern commune of Soyons (Solo by Livy, Epitome 103) in 62 BC.\n\n\n==== The selection of the site ====\nThe city of Valentia was established on a terrace on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the confluence of the Is\u00e8re and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the Dr\u00f4me.\nThis geographical situation is understood by the crossing of several routes of transport and communications:\n\nValentia had a privileged place in north-south trade through the Rh\u00f4ne and at the Via Agrippa.\nValentia was part of east-west routes since the different paths, which traversed the plain from the Is\u00e8re Valley and the Dr\u00f4me (Voie des Alpes), converged on the city. The Rh\u00f4ne was crossed at Valence on a ferry, by ford or over a bridge.\n\n\n==== The ancient city ====\nThe city of Valence, as many Gallo-Roman cities, received an orthonormal plan. The orientation of the urban streets network successively followed cadastres \"A\" inclined N, 12\u00b030'E and \"B\", inclined N, 23\u00b0E, in the Valence plain.We know the decumanus of the city thanks to the discovery of a pavement and a sewer a few metres north of the city hall. The cardo of the urban network was the Via Agrippa that crossed the city in a straight line from the southern gate of the city to the old gate and Tower of Aion, north of the city, which later became \"Tourdeon\" (now destroyed).It was along the Via Agrippa that a forum was located, probably surrounded by a civil basilica, curia, a temple, etc., of which the location is unknown.To the south of the presumed forum site, between the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre and Rue Vernoux the ruins of the thermae were discovered. This thermal water supply, and more generally that of the city of Valentia, was thanks to the numerous springs in the vicinity. The site of Valence still presents a dense network of streams and canals born of the overflow of water which escapes in sources at the foot of the terraces, forming, in the east, a curved line from the source of the Treuil up to the Fountain of Malcontents, and near the Rh\u00f4ne and the lower town, a quasi-parallel line to the river from the Saint-Pierre source until the descent of the Boulevard Gambetta. Thus, the Chony quarter (in the current commune of Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence), were found remains of pipes that belonged to the aqueduct that brought water from the source of the Treuil to Valence.\n\nAll around the current cathedral were discovered fragments of architecture probably belonging to a large temple.\nThe city had entertainment facilities:\n\nA circus whose memory would be preserved in the name of the Cire quarter (\"Siry\" in the Middle Ages).\nAn amphitheatre, was on the edge of the Rh\u00f4ne, outside of the enclosure or near the New Gate.\nA C\u00f4te Sainte-Ursule theatre: Three surveys have revealed the orchestra, traces of large markets and large wall elements. It was located at the northern edge of the city.\nAn odeon whose curvature would be materialized by the Rue du Croissant. In fact, the foundations of an odeon were found during the construction of the new museum, in the Place des Ormeaux and its outline is materialised on the ground at the entrance to the museum.The city was surrounded by ramparts from the early Roman Empire. This was constructed between 15 BC and 15 AD. In 1869, excavations to the south of the old town revealed the existence of a monumental gate defended by two protruding towers. The fa\u00e7ade, or at least the pillars which were observed during the excavation, was covered with a large piece of sandstone and adorned with a frieze of military trophies: Shields, leggings and reastplates.\nHouses settled around the city, outside the city walls.\n\nTo the east of the city of Valentia, not far from the Voie des Alpes (in the direction of Die and Gap), in the current Rue Faventines.\nTo the west, in the Nonniers quarter, in the commune of Guilherand-Granges (right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne, facing Valence): A bridge or a ferry connecting the banks of the river.The ancient port was perhaps on the territory of the current commune of Bourg-les-Valence.\nNumerous tombs were crowded at the exit of the city, along the tracks: Several burial grounds were discovered in the east and south of the ancient city.\n\n\n==== Late antiquity ====\nDuring the first centuries of the Christian era, Valence became an important road junction on maps and routes, and the late Roman Empire, this city retained its privileged position.\nHowever, as early as the 4th century, Valentia faced many raids but the city within the ramparts retained its monumental adornments competing according to Ammianus Marcellinus (Histoires, XV, 11, 14), with Arles and Vienne.\nAt the dawn of the 5th century, the city lived in shelter of the ramparts erected under the late Roman Empire (still a visible construction in the 19th century). The Visigoths seized Valence in 413 AD; the Burgundians were masters of the Rh\u00f4ne basin at the end of the 5th century; the Valence people fell to the Frankish Kingdom in 533 AD. These successive invasions removed almost all traces of Romanisation.\nDuring this troubled period, the city converted its ancient walls into stronger fortifications: Roman gates were bricked up, thus doing away with the two main axes of the city and lasting restructuring of the urban network. The rural inhabitants settled on small hills of the plain, giving rise to a large number of villages: Montoison, Montmeyran, Mont\u00e9lier, Montvendre, Mont\u00e9l\u00e9ger, etc.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAround 800, a new Cathedral of Saint-Est\u00e8ve (of St. Stephen) was built instead of the baptistery, with a choir that was oriented to the west. It was constructed symmetrically to the Evangelist Church. It housed numerous relics: Those of saints Apollinaire, Cyprien, Corneille, F\u00e9lix, Fortunat, Achill\u00e9e and a fragment of the True Cross. The episcopal district also included housing for the canons, grouped around a court cemetery, and a round church, Notre-Dame-la-Ronde. At the beginning of the 9th century, perhaps before, the Roman wall was raised with walls constructed from pebbles. In 890, the widow of King Boso of Provence had their son, Louis III, crowned King of Provence in Valence.In 1029, the Archbishop of Vienne invested Guigues III \"the Old\" of the County of Viennois. It belonged to the family of the Counts of Albon, which held the region for decades, frequently occupying the county and the Diocese of Valence. The region still suffered the raids of the Saracens at the end of the 9th and the 10th century.The Rh\u00f4ne was sometimes presented as the border between the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire which made Valence part, until the 15th century, but it was especially a link between the countries bordering it. The Diocese of Valence, as the rival principality, the County of Valentinois and Diois, extended on both sides. It was also an important commercial axis, especially for salt, which would benefit the city which guards traces of the name of Rue \"Sauni\u00e8re\", formerly the name of one of the four gates of Valence, the one which gave access to the south. The city also benefitted from its position at a point of change in the regime of winds in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley: In the Middle Ages, vessels ascended the river only by being hauled to the col, by sweat (by men). North of Valence, the rise could be done under sail (but not always). At the end of the 15th century, it was even the capital of hauling along the towpath, because beside this advantage due to the wind, it was a one-day stop from Lyon, and a crossroads into the mountains. Finally, the rise of the Rh\u00f4ne was particularly difficult at Valence, which caused forced stops. Several Valentinois were specialised in the brokerage of haulers. The haulers pulled either a big boat or boat trains, with teams from a few dozen to several hundred men. Each man drew a mass of about a ton. This mode of hauling regressed at the end of the 15th century, to be replaced by hauling by horses, except for local hauling.\n\nThe city, safe from the flooding of the river and protected by its ramparts, was a step on the road for pilgrimages to Compostela. Religious life flourished, the Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral was built as well as the Abbey of the canons of Saint-Ruf. Two major characters vied for power over the city: The Bishop and the Count of Valentinois.\nEconomic growth translated into the development of towns, especially on the side of the Rh\u00f4ne: The Rivi\u00e8re (Riperia) said today, less poetically, as \"Basse-Ville\". The new city, north of the former Pomperi gate and Bourg-Saint-Pierre, formed around the Abbey of Saint-Pierre, which spawned the current commune of Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence. Elsewhere, on the middle terrace, habitat outside-the-walls was associated with religious foundations: The commandery of the Hospitallers, the Tourdeon gate, the Abbey of Saint-F\u00e9lix, the Saint-Sulpice gate, the Faventines Templar Commandery, the Benedictine Priory of Saint-Victor in the south near the former Via Agrippa and, perhaps, further to the south, a leprosarium whose memory is retained through the channel of la Maladi\u00e8re.\nAfter the disappearance of the County of Valentinois, incorporated into the Province of Dauphin\u00e9, the dauphin Louis II de Poitiers-Valentinois may have imposed homage to the Bishop and Abbot of Saint-Ruf (free Abbot and immuniste): Valence was therefore incorporated into the province of Dauphin\u00e9. On the death of Louis II, who was the last count, the Valentinois was sold in 1419 by his heirs, his daughter Louise de Poitiers (widow of Humbert VII de Thoire and Villars) and close relatives to Charles, dauphin and King of France (Charles VII). The County of Valentinois was attached to the Crown of France in 1424.\n\nThe second half of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century were a golden age for the medieval city, materialised by the Maison des T\u00eates and the Pendentif de Valence. Founded on 26 July 1452 by the dauphin Louis, future Louis XI, the University of Valence grew quickly. Renowned professors from various countries, as Jacques Cujas forged its reputation by teaching the law, theology, medicine and arts. After his coronation, Louis XI confirmed its preference by mailing the letters patent for the university on 12 October 1461. In March 1480, the King still supported his preferred university.The dauphin Louis made numerous stays in Valence where, as a sign of allegiance, he donated a gate to the city, the Sauni\u00e8re gate and a few houses nearby. It made for a \"delphinal palace\", later occupied by the religious order of the Recollects. As Louis XI, he allowed a market in the town of Valence, in 1476, during his stay in the city and confirmed tax privileges for the city of Valence.\nThis era ended abruptly in 1562 during the occupation of the city by the troops of the Protestant Baron des Adrets: All the religious buildings of Valence were partially or completely destroyed.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\n\nFran\u00e7ois Rabelais studied at Valence in 1532, before settling in Lyon, a great cultural centre where the library trade blossomed.\nA strategic location in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, Valence had been militarised since its origin and had 7,100 inhabitants in the 1700s, who bore responsibility for housing soliers. To reduce this burden a municipal deliberation was offered in 1714: a barracks was constructed in the current Rue Bouffier, a temporary camp which quickly became inadequate to accommodate the 12,000 men and 20,000 horses stationed there. The city invested 190,000 livres for the installation of a new barracks in the Rollin quarter, north of the Roman road.\nCharles IX passed through the town during his royal tour of France (1564\u20131566), accompanied by the Court and the nobles of the Kingdom: His brother the Duke of Anjou, Henri de Navarre and the Cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine.It was in Valence that the saga of Louis Mandrin ended in May 1755, the smuggler who challenged the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and redistributed the proceeds of his theft from it. After spending several days in the city prison, Mandrin was sentenced to death: It was conducted on the Place des Clercs where the scaffold was erected, his death ensued on the breaking wheel. His body was exposed after his death, during three days, and many people flocked to pay him a last tribute, as his popularity increased. The death of Mandrin on the wheel of Valence marked the end of his actions, but also the beginning of a legend, as the man had marked the minds of his contemporaries.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was assigned in the city from 1785 to 1786 in the La F\u00e8re artillery regiment. He made many future visits. He would indeed return repeatedly to Valence. It included crossing the city on 12 October 1799, during the return of the expedition to Egypt, and offered to his former landlady who came to welcome him at the posthouse, a cashmere of India (offered to the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament), a compass and a powder spoon (available at the Museum of Valence in 1862). He also met the future Cardinal Spina, who would negotiate on behalf of Pope Pius VII in the Concordat of 1801, on the same day.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nAfter the convening of the Estates-General, agitation and anxiety grew until the storming of the Bastille, news of which reached the region around 20 July, causing hope but also increasing concerns of a reactionary plot of aristocrats. The Great Fear arose in the region of a rumor, and spread by degrees, at a blistering pace according to local networks, putting all the villages in motion for their defence. Once the peak of fear passed, a latent anxiety remained, the village communities realised that in an emergency, they were in fact isolated and practically reduced to their own devices. National guards were formed quickly, including in Valence, but communities found it insufficient, and they constituted local federations of mutual assistance, bypassing the old provincial divisions. In the region, it was Largenti\u00e8re which called for a F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration on 23 August, Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re in September, La Voulte gathered 12,000 National Guardsmen to the Champs de l'\u00c9toile on 29 November. Valence invited the surrounding communities on 31 January and brought together 16,000 guards of 293 communes. The region had other celebrations of federation in the winter and spring, culminating in the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration of 14 July 1790, celebrated in Paris and simultaneously in 250 cities in France, including Valence.The university disappeared in 1792 to be reborn at the end of the 20th century. It is now in the 21st Century part of the Community Grenoble Alpes University.\nThis community played another role during the final years of the French Revolution. On August 29, 1799, six weeks after his arrival at this community, the then longest ever reigning Roman Catholic Church's 250th Pope Pius VI died here in exile from his Vatican, then within the 754-1798 Papal States, but now within the 1st Republic of France's created 1798-1799 Roman Republic. After some political intrigue covering more than two years, it will not be until December 24, 1801, that the then late pope's body will finally leave Valence and return to the Vatican.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nAfter the Armenian Genocide of 1915, many Armenians took refuge in France in the 1920s. The community remembers how Valence employers travelled to Marseille to recruit 150 of the first arrivals in 1922. By 1926 827 Armenians had settled in Valence, and 1,670 by 1931 \u2013 from Bursa, Malatya and Harput. If the Armenians were popular among their employers, they encountered the distrust of the Valence people. It was a group with a very high proportion of young adults, children and the elderly who suffered most from the genocide and from the journey into exile. They worked mainly as labourers, or founded small businesses (25% of employed persons). Very quickly, an \"Armenian quarter\" developed between Boulevard Vauban, Rue Farnerie, Rue Madier-Montjau, and the Boulevard d'Alsace, 40% populated by Armenians. The entire old town, with dilapidated buildings, abandoned and inexpensive, became involved in this process.In 1956 the group had 2,500 people, or 6% of the population of Valence, and represented the fourth-largest Armenian community in France (after those of Paris, Lyon and Marseille). The community's very strong identity (with newspapers, cinemas, dance halls, Armenian Sports Union) was dispersed, with the \"Armenian village\" on the Rue de Fontlozier. It showed signs of rapid integration: In 1946, half of the 2,000 Armenians of Valencia opted for French citizenship.In 1947, 200 Armenians of Valence took advantage of the offer to return to the Soviet countries, which proved to be a failure. The strong community welcomed new refugees, escaping from political turmoil in Syria during the 1950-60s, and Lebannon during the Civil war in 1970-80s. As of 1997 7,500 people in Valence belonged to this community, which makes the Armenian community of Valence one of the largest in France: the Armenian National Union is also based in Valence.This strong presence has passed into the odonymy: a street and a square of the old Armenian quarter make reference to it: the Rue d\u2019Arm\u00e9nie and the Place Missak Manouchian. The cultural life of the community is very active, with 28 associations, including the Evangelical Church, the Armenian courts, and the House of Armenian culture.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAfter the invasion of Poland by Germany, on 1 September 1939, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Germany invaded France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 10 May 1940.\nDuring World War II, Valence suffered several allied aerial bombardments, intended to destroy the bridge over the Rh\u00f4ne. On 15 August 1944, bombs destroyed several quarters and buildings in the city, including the hospital, killing 280 people. From the era of the prefecture, there remained only the gate, which has been carefully preserved since. Four days later, on 19 August 1944, a German train loaded with nitroglycerin exploded, largely destroying the quarter of La Palla and causing 335 casualties among civilians, the military and the resistance fighters. On 2 August 1944, south of Valence, bombings of the railway depot and yard of Portes-l\u00e8s-Valence destroyed 51 locomotives, with 12 victims and 58 wounded among the railway workers and the population.The northern part of Valence, almost completely razed to the ground, was rebuilt and today one finds many administrative buildings in this area such as the Hotel of prefecture of the Dr\u00f4me, the general treasury, social security, the post office and the police headquarters.\nDr\u00f4me was one of the departments where the Resistance was the most active. In 1943, the Resistance was organised and grew, and many Dr\u00f4me people were called and committed themselves to the cause. With the introduction of the STO, young men were required to go to work in Germany. Many of them refused this situation and went into hiding in the countryside or joined the Maquis. Resistance developed throughout the entire department in small units. The Dr\u00f4me terrain was conducive to the installation of camps. The population supported increasing resistance.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe city of Valence is a territorial collectivity administered by a municipal council which is the deliberative assembly of the commune and which aims to regulate by its deliberations the business of the municipality. The municipal council elects the mayor. As for any commune whose population is between 60,000 and 79,999 inhabitants, this council has 49 members (mayor, 14 deputies and 34 municipal councillors) elected by direct universal suffrage for a renewable term of six years.\nThe current mayor of Valence is Nicolas Daragon, a member of the UMP elected in 2014. The current council was elected in April 2014.\nThe City Hall of Valence employs more than 1,700 municipal officers (permanent and non-permanent jobs) representing more than 100 trades and all exercising a public service mission, ranging from the maintenance of roads, maintenance of parks, the management of cultural and sports coaching schools, etc.\nFollowing the 2014 municipal elections, the composition of the municipal council of Valence is as follows:\n\n\n==== List of mayors ====\n\n\n=== Cantons ===\nCapital of the department of Dr\u00f4me, the city of Valence is divided into four cantons, of which it is chef-lieu.\nThe cantonal division of Valence has evolved since the creation of the departments in 1790. Established in 1801, the canton of Valence was divided into two in 1964, and then three in 1973 and finally into four in 1984. The cantonal redistricting of 2015 led to the creation of four new cantons each containing a fraction of the commune of Valence and whole communes.\n\n\n=== Political trends and outcomes ===\n\n\n=== Intercommunality and intercommunal trade unions ===\nValence is the largest city of Valence Romans Agglo, an agglomeration community with 51 communes of the region. It is responsible for several areas of skills, including local public transport, economic development, sanitation and environment, sports complexes and public libraries management.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nThe committee of twinning of Valence is the association responsible for the promotion, coordination and organisation of exchanges between Valence and its twin cities, with the support of the city of Valence.\nSeveral cities are twinned or partners of Valence:Valence is twinned with:\n\n Asti, Italy, since 1966\n Biberach an der Ri\u00df, Germany, since 1967\n Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom, since 1969\n Ijevan, Armenia, since 1996\n Gedera, Israel, since 1997\n Batroun, Lebanon, since 2005Valence is a partner city with:\n\n Hammamet, Tunisia\n\n\n== Population and society ==\n\n\n=== Demography ===\nIn 2012, the municipality had 62,481 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793. From the 21st century, the communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants have a census each year as a result of a sample survey, unlike the other communes which have a real census every five years.\nIn 2011, its agglomeration had 127,559 inhabitants (over 10 municipalities) and its metropolitan area had 175,095 inhabitants (39 communes across Dr\u00f4me and Ard\u00e8che).\n\n\n=== Worship and humanist associations ===\nValence has two Catholic parishes, which depend on the Diocese of Valence, Deanery of Valence: Notre-Dame-des-Peuples of Valence and Saint \u00c9milien of Valence.A mosque, in the city centre of Valence, welcomes the members of the Muslim faith.The Jewish community also has a synagogue in Valence.The Armenian community, comprising over 10% of the population has its own church, Saint Sahag (Isaac) and in November 2017 launched the construction of an Armenian language daily-school.\nProtestants also have a place of worship in Valence, through the Reformed Church of France, as well as the Evangelical Protestant Church and the Salvation Army.\n\n\n=== Cultural events and festivities ===\nValence f\u00eate le printemps [Valence spring festival]: Celebrating agricultural productions\nBoulevards de chines [Boulevard of china]: Flea markets and antiques\nFestival de Valence [Festival of Valence]: Free concerts in the city\nLes F\u00e9eries d'Hiver [Winter extravaganza]: Show and Fireworks\n\n\n== Health ==\nValence has two hospitals, a public and a private. Many health professionals are installed on the commune, including 58 physicians, 67 nurses, 80 physiotherapists. Since 2009, Valence is a member of the WHO city health network, through its commitments for the promotion of good nutrition practices, Valence is also very active in the National Programme of Health and Nutrition (PNNS).\n\n\n=== Central Hospital of Valence ===\nThe Centre Hospitalier de Valence [Central Hospital of Valence] (CHV) employed 2,570 people in 2013. It includes all clinical specialties (medicine, Oncology, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, care and rehabilitation, long stay, etc.). It has a maternity hospital where approximately 2,326 babies (including 20.9% deliveries by caesarean section and 60.6% deliveries under epidural) are born each year. The Central Hospital of Valence has a capacity of 740 beds. In 2011, nearly 67,000 people were presented as emergencies; the operating block has practised more than 10,000 interventions, nearly 29 interventions per day. In the maternity ward of the hospital, over 2,000 children were born. The Woman-Mother-Child Centre welcomes paediatrics, neonatology and obstetrics, infant surgery, gynaecology and the hospitalisation units for woman and child. The Medical and Tumour Pathologies Centre welcomes gastro-enterology, haematology, oncology, haemovigilance, pulmonology \u2013 infectious diseases, dermatology, alcohol addiction, and palliative care. The Geriatrics and Rehabilitation Centre brings together the geriatric mobile team, the USLD, the EHPAD, the geriatric SSR, and rehabilitation. The Surgery and Anesthesia Centre block welcomes orthopaedics, ENT, the ophthalmology, gynecological surgery, urology, neurosurgery, anesthesia, and an operating room. The Medicine and Specialties Centre includes cardiology, neurology, department of medicine, multipurpose medicine and dietetics. After the opening of the radiology building, a surgical building of 263 beds and places opened its doors in June 2011.\n\n\n=== Dr\u00f4me Ard\u00e8che Private Hospital ===\nThe H\u00f4pital Priv\u00e9 Dr\u00f4me Ard\u00e8che [Dr\u00f4me Ard\u00e8che Private Hospital] (HPDA) is a complex created in 2005 from the joining of the Clinique Pasteur [Pasteur clinic] (located on the neighboring commune of Guilherand-Granges) and the Clinique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Valence [Valence General clinic] (located in the quarter of Chaffit in Valence). It has 361 beds and places spread across the two sites. Its Emergency Department, located on the site of Pasteur, is open 7 days a week and 24 hours a day. In 2013, the Dr\u00f4me Ard\u00e8che Private Hospital staff consists of 150 doctors and liberal surgeons, 180 nurses, 140 caregivers, 20 midwives, 16 childcare auxiliaries, 110 other hospital workers and porters, 45 other paramedic personnel, and 80 administrative and technical personnel.\n\n\n=== Emergency services and civil security ===\nThe firefighters of the Dr\u00f4me department (SDIS 26) includes 2,735 staff (316 professional firefighters and 2,419 volunteers); its headquarters (which also houses the board of directors) is located at 235 Route de Mont\u00e9lier in Valence. Under the direction of Commander Laurent Blanchard, the firefighters of the Dr\u00f4me took part in 28,551 interventions in 2013. The main rescue centre (known as \"CSP\", commonly referred to as the sapeurs-pompiers de Valence [firefighters of Valence]) is under the responsibility of Captain Fabien Thepaut. It is the most important centre of intervention of the department and is located at 57 Rue de Chantecouriol, Hugo-Provence Quarter in Valence. There are also seven assistance intervention centres (CIS) in the Valence agglomeration (CIS of Beaumont-l\u00e8s-Valence, Chabeuil, Etoile-sur-Rh\u00f4ne, Mont\u00e9lier, Portes-l\u00e8s-Valence, Saint-Marcel-l\u00e8s-Valence and Saint-P\u00e9ray).\nThe SAMU 26 is an emergency medical assistance service which has the mission to receive and treat emergency calls on the territory of Dr\u00f4me. Its mission is to provide pre-hospital assistance to victims of accidents or sudden illnesses in critical condition.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== School education ===\n\n10 coll\u00e8ges (Paul-Valery, Camille-Vernet, Sainte-Anne, Jean-Zay, etc.)\n4 classical lyc\u00e9es (Camille-Vernet [artistic options: Cinema, art, music, Russian], Institution Notre-Dame, Institution Saint-Victor, \u00c9mile Loubet [artistic options: Theatre, dance, Chinese])\n6 vocational lyc\u00e9es (La Providence, Victor-Hugo, etc.)\n1 lyc\u00e9e of technical training (Jules-Algoud industrial lyc\u00e9e)\n1 tertiary versatile lyc\u00e9e\n1 industrial technology lyc\u00e9e\nMontplaisir Catholic private lyc\u00e9e\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nThe city of Valence is now developing its high level educational role in the Dr\u00f4me/Ard\u00e8che area.

Built in the mid-nineteenth century, offices there are now led by the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter according to the extraordinary form of the Roman rite.\nThe Italian theatre dates back to 1837.

There are traces of the walls at the top of the C\u00f4te Sainte-Ursule and at the bottom of C\u00f4te Sylvante; they served to protect the city from invasions, epidemics or flooding caused by the Rh\u00f4ne. They were widely used in medieval times by the people (boatmen, carters, mule, etc.) who used these stairs to go to the small streets and squares of the upper town. The C\u00f4te Sainte-Ursule meanwhile was less used; it separated the properties of two monasteries. It is set at the location of the Roman theatre and probably served as an exit.

The name of Valence comes from three Celtic words: \"val\" (water), \"len\" (plain) and \"ty\" (House) and would mean \"water-rich inhabited place\". At the time these rivers allowed the inhabitants to satisfy many needs and activities: Fishing, irrigation, washing, soaking, driving force for flour mills, oil, fuller and silk. They are now a place to walk for many inhabitants.\nIt is in the neighborhoods east of Valence, at the foot of a terrace, the terrasse du s\u00e9minaire, that the channels (with a total length of 17 kilometres (11 mi), or 40 kilometres (25 mi) when counting secondary irrigation channels) originate. Very quickly, the Valence people strove to channel these waters forming unhealthy marshes. In the 13th century, the regulation and the use of the channels was the privilege of the monasteries of Saint-Ruf and Saint-Victor, who decided the location of the mills.\nIndeed, the water used for irrigation, drinking water and washhouses, was also a valuable source of energy for the economic development of the era. The main (Charran, Thon, Moulins and Malcontents) cross the city from east to west before joining to form the Canal de l'\u00c9pervi\u00e8re which then flows into the Rh\u00f4ne. In the 19th century, the channels lost their significance and would even be a little forgotten, hidden by urbanisation, high-rise buildings and roads.\nIn recent years, the municipality has undertaken a development work of paths, bordered by poplars and willows, along these channels.

These \"lovers\" would travel the world and adorn many objects. Raymond Peynet worked on that momentum for many newspapers. After becoming famous, Peynet returned to Valence in April 1966, to baptise the kiosk which now bears his name.\nThe lovers of Peynet inspired the song Les amoureux des bancs publics of Georges Brassens.

The little couple is sought by collectors around the world. Japan has two Peynet museums (Karuizawa and Sakuto), while in Hiroshima, a statue of the Lovers faces the memorial of the atomic bombing. There is also a kiosque and a museum dedicated to the artist in the small commune of Brassac-les-Mines.

        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Montpellier's main railway station is Saint-Roch. There are plans to construct a high-speed railway linking N\u00eemes and Montpellier with the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.\n\nThe Montpellier \u2013 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Airport is located in the area of Fr\u00e9jorgues, in the town of Mauguio, southeast of Montpellier.\nThe Transports de l'agglom\u00e9ration de Montpellier (TaM) manages the city's public transportation, including its 56-kilometre (35 mi) tramway network consisting of four lines and several parking facilities. Line 1 runs from Mosson in the west to Odysseum in the east. Line 2 runs from Jacou in the northeast to St. Jean-de-Vedas in the southwest. Line 3 and Line 4 opened in April 2012. Line 3, which is 22.4-kilometre (13.9 mi) long, links Juvignac and Perols with a branch to Lattes and serves 32 stations. Line 4 circles the centre and serves as a connector line between the various arms of tram system. They intersect at Gare St. Roch station, Rives du Lez and Corum.\nThe TaM also manages the large bike sharing scheme V\u00e9lomagg', started in June 2007, comprising 1200 bicycles and 50 stations.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMontpellier was the finish of Stage 11 and the departure of Stage 12 in the 2007 Tour de France.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

          "Not the best zoo we have ever visited but it could be when the renovations have been carried out. Over 80 hectares of forest and scrub land plus an Amazonian 'greenhouse' houses hundreds of animals and birds. No entrance fee to the zoo, and only a few euros to tour the",
          "If you are spending a few days in Montpellier then it is well worth a trip out to the zoo for half a day. It is easy to get there on public transport, tram to Saint Eloi then the university \u201cNavette\u201d which drops you off right outside. The zoo is free to visit as its",
          "It is a hard one. The zoo is free even though we paid to visit the Amazon exhibit. But the toilets were terrible and the signs were a bit random. Some great enclosures however. It is a big piece of land and has lots of large animals due to the space. The Amazon exhibit is very",
          "I've visited Parc Zoologique three times, and every time I have found something new to see. The zoo area itself is pretty big, so you can easily get lost and surely get lost for the first time. When we were wandering around, we also discovered \"jogging trails\" in the zoo forest.",
          "We visited the zoo based on the TripAdvisor reviews. It has loads of space, is free and has some excellent animals. But it\u2019s very poorly signposted inside, lacks facilities such as coffee shops, restaurants etc and was lacking animals you find in most zoos such as tigers,",
          "An exceptional zoo in a most unexpected place. A wide array of wild animals in very good condition in a very natural environment. Extensive grounds, allowing you to walk through at your leisure and enjoy the environment. Best of all, to see the major attractions, it is FREE!",
          "This was an entirely unexpected bonus for me in Montpellier. This small zoo is a gem, and while it doesn\u2019t have a vast collection, what it does have makes for an enjoyable outing. Recommended!",
          "I have visited it few times. Its a very nice place for kids and few adults who love animals.The restaurant is cool. They serve verygood Fish recipies like Bar. Go for it on a sunny day.",
          "Ok so this zoo has major potential. The entrance & parking are free, grounds are extensive, the playground is very nice, paid portion is worth it, animals we could see were very cool. It lacked a lot though. Toilets were even by free europe standards not good, paths falling",
          "The park is beautiful. The gronds are kept sufficiently \"wild\" so you are on a \"safari\" through the zoo. The animals are well cared for. You can see they are happy and well fed and cared for. I have never seen it \"full\" as the park is very big. And of course, the staff is",
          "I have no idea how this is free but really nice zoo. It is unlike any I have been to before. The enclosures are very sympathetic to the animals, limited viewing points and unobtrusive. Sure to this there can be pretty long walks between enclosures, but hey, the animals welfare",
          "What a cracking little place this was. And free. Yes, some of the paths are fairly rough and steep and not completely buggy or wheelchair friendly; Yes, there are occasionally large sections of park/woods areas without any animals; and yes if the sun is scorching there is a lack",
          "I'm not a big zoo fan but this zoo is ok by my standards. They take good care of their animals, there is a lot of place for them to run around with a great variety. It's a nice outing for a sunday afternoon. By hot weather make sure to bring a hat and water it can get really",
          "Love that such a great place is free to enter. I enjoyed walking up and down the hills and the good views of the area surrounding Montpellier, as well as the native forest. The animals are clearly well cared for and you sometimes can't see them - a good sign that they have space",
          "Montpellier's main zoo is free! Easy to get there by tram and then bus. You can get good views of rhinos, giraffes, bears and Iberia wolves in particular. Animal enclosures are supplemented by wooden statues of the animals for kids to climb on. It's a bit of a walk, with",
          "Great zoo. Bring a picnic and plenty of water as walk around takes over two hours with young children. But take your time and the surroundings are lovely, as are the animals. The enclosures are large and some animals (leopard) are hard to see, but that gives feeling that the",
          "It's easy to get to on the tram, it's a little different to English ones, the animals are spread out over a lot more land and it's very hilly, make sure you have water with you and comfortable shoes, we took about 2-3 hours to walk round.",
          "This zoo seems a forest. You don\u00b4t feel like \"jails\". Paths between trees drive you to animal locations, wide spaces. No big holes separations, but no sense of danger, near a wild life real experience Free entry! Amazonia has a separae building with amazonic forest and",
          "This zoo is fantastic for people of all ages, we had such a great time at this zoo and it was a nice walk between each animal. There is a free map provided which helps you find your way round. There is also a bus which runs there frequently and it is really easy to get too. It",
          "A different kind of zoo, with a lot of paths and spaces (forested areas) between the animals. No guarantee that you will see animals in the area. Great restaurant near the entrance. We didn't go into the Rain-forest area, but could see into a section from the second floor of the",
          "This zoo is one of the best I've been with my four and nine year olds - and we've been to a fair few! Whilst entry to the Zoo is free, it's worth paying a few extra Euros to enter the 'Serre Amazonienne' which offers an extensive display of Amazonian flora and fauna. It also",
          "We've been enjoying this zoo for many many years. We've watched the zoo evolve over the years and appreciate the spaces and greenery allotted to the animals. Your little ones can opt for smaller trails and your older kids can do the longer distances. Arrive early or outside",
          "Located a bit away from the center, the zoo is in a very nice and maintained park. You can easily walk around with kids and see a bunch of animals. Pretty cheap as well, it was a great activity",
          "The zoo is big and have interesting animals. They have bathroom and water during the path. My complains are that they should put more signs pointing where to go to see each animal (no signs on intersections) and several animals where not visible when we passed through.",
          "A nice and calming experience, great for kids... not sure if adults would enjoy it if they've been to a bigger zoo. Still, it was well organized and a nice way to pass an hour or two.",
          "This place is free, apart from the amazon rainforest house bit. It's a good space, with nice long walks possible. It's not overly commercialised inside with only one cafe and gift shop at the entrance, which both offered reasonably priced goods. There are picnic spots inside",
          "Great day out, lots of animals to see and well laid out and a great children's play area. Great restaurant and very children friendly.",
          "Excellent day out for kids all ages in this lovely Zoo and park in which animals are semi-free and entrance is free! It is a short bus ride from the town.",
          "For a zoo it was ok. The Amazone rain forest was for me the best part. Entry into the zoo is free but there is a charge for the rain forest part. The animals in the main zoo have smaller enclosures than most zoos I have been to. We felt bad for certain animals. Lots of",
          "How this is zoo is free is beyond me. They could easily charge \u20ac10 for entry. We seen plenty of animals and got really close to some we never gave before. Particularly enjoyed the lions, bears and zebras! Fairly easy to get to by the tram and then we walked up to the zoo about",
          "Visited the zoo and it is free entry which is great, seeing the animals was amazing however there were a lot of empty enclosures and found ourselves to be walking around for ages without seeing anything. It was a very quiet day when we visited so perhaps that is why but didn't",
          "We really enjoyed this zoo as it is really a park with animals! It was great to walk in the shade ( it was very hot) and discover the animal enclosures. Amazing that it is free! The restaurant was also surprisingly good-we ate excellent salads there. Easy to get to using public",
          "We took out 4 boys on a hot day. we visited the rain forest area first and that was worth the entry fees. lots of birds,animal, insect and fish life to see.This took about an hour, all the boys enjoyed this area and generated lots of questions from them. The main zoo is free and",
          "The park itself makes for a nice walk but Im not too keen on the size/conditions of some of the enclosures.",
          "Just don't go when it's really hot the animals will be hiding in the shade. There's a lot for picnicking and walking. You could make this the main activity and it's free!",
          "No elephants here but it is a huge zoo. Rather rough walking if you are pushing a stroller. Lots of hills. Go early in the morning to take advantage of the shade as the zoo is large and very spread out.",
          "Big zoo and it's free. But to be fair: nothing spectacular and similar to other, average zoos. But if you've some free time...",
          "Average at best, but for a free attraction worth a trip if you're looking for a something to do for a few hours. There is a tropical section which you have to pay to enter, this was better than the main zoo but still quite limited.",
          "Had read reviews that this was a free zoo and two thoughts sprang to mind... Only for locals carrying a council tax bill paid up in full or there will be a dog, cat and three fish! On arriving the car park was free, good start... We got to the entrance and a queue at a kiosk",
          "A small zoo, but with some interesting animals. An easy tram and bus ride to get there. Nice walking trails.",
          "If you are in Montpellier, the Parc Zoologic is definitely worth a visit. The place is slighltl off the city main beaten track but it\u2019s well connected anyway. It\u2019s free and the animal collection is good. The enclosures are quite big (but some of them have high rough vegetation",
          "The zoo is free which is great ! You can pay to go to the indoor tropical bit, but we didn't do that. Animals are well spread out so the park doesn't get busy. Great for a relaxed walk around in the sun. Make sure you give yourself some time as we had to go twice to get through",
          "The zoo is amazing, there is a vast amount of wildlife to see like Rhinoceros Zebra Giraffe and many other species you would not see in a UK zoo. The zoo is absolutely free although there is a small change to enter the rain forest section but it is well worth the entrance fee.",
          "It is named a zoo but it is more like a park for me, it is free apart from some parts, it is really nice to walk around but this is more a place for local families to spend their weekends so it is impossible to find a parking place. Well; you can also come by bike if you know",
          "We couldn't believe that the zoo was completely free to visit. Apparently there is an indoor area that requires an entrance fee, but we didn't bother with that as there was plenty to see outside. The zoo seems to be treated as an ordinary park by the locals - there were lots",
          "Our children love this zoo! They have big, natural habitats, happy animals, and miles of shaded paths to walk along, enough to tire out the entire family! We also bring our Daily English ESL students here, and it is always a favourite activity among them! My favourites are the",
          "I visited this zoo two times with friends. Huge territory with different kinds of animals. It is possible to see animals closely. I enjoyed this place. But suggest to take a hat and some water with you. In summer it is really hot and on such a big territory it is difficult to",
          "Please note this is not a zoo in the accepted sense, it is a park that has interesting botanical specimens and happens to have some wild animals in decent enclosures. Animals are mostly from Africa and include: small monkeys, giraffe, rhino, cheetah, lion, zebra, and antelope.",
          "The Zoo is a little way out of the centre. We took the tram, followed by an uphill walk of around half an hour. There may be buses which go nearer. Entry is free, except for a tropical house near the entrance, which we did not go into. The grounds are extensive. The animals have",
          "Entrance is free, which was a big bonus. The serre is paying but did not enter here. As the zoo was free, we were a bit hesitant about the conditions, but actually the parc is really great. A lot of open space, it's not cage after cage, but u can walk for a while in a nature",
          "The cost of getting to the zoo was cheap - 6 euros for up to 5 people (and lasts 24hrs). The zoo is free. The only downside is that you need to be prepared to walk as the zoo is enormous and the animals spread apart - although, the scenery was enjoyable. Its also a good spot if",
          "A wonderful half-day visit to a zoo, perfect for a cloudy day. The main zoo is free of charge, the indoor section was \u20ac6,50 for adults. Both are well worth visiting. The zoo is large and has many different species, from lions and leopards to giraffes and rhinos. The enclosures",
          "If you've got a couple of hours to wander around, the Montpellier Zoo is excellent. It is free, well designed, and perfect for strolling.",
          "One of the best places for Sunday afternoon walks in Montpellier I'd say :) A lot of animals, if you're lucky you can even the Lions. Main advantage, it's for free !!! If you notice a stop entry, it's only for the amazonian greenhouse on the right side FYI, no need to pay",
          "First of all you can't beat the price (it's free!). We started by looking for felines, and neither the cougar nor the lions were anywhere to be seen. Other parts of the zoo were much better, and we got some nice sightings of rhinos, giraffes, ostriches and some more. The",
          "While to get around this zoo takes a lot of walking a really stuffed full afternoon, or more relaxing full day, this is a great zoo for the animals. The property is expansive and varied terrain. While all this space can make it harder to see all the animals (the day we were",
          "We went there with the grandchildren - a marvelous day (it took all day indeed) - we went seeing animals and went back on request. The wooden carved animals add to the magic In short - with children/grandchildren do not miss the place",
          "We visited and had low expectations due to some of the reviews, but were pleasantly surprised. It's quite a sprawling and hilly site, with little shade. There is a nice playground for the kids and drinking water fountains scattered around the site. There are not lots of",
          "We had a fantastic day at the park Zoologique today. It is unbelievable that this pale is free of charge. Both the entrance and parking. It was lovely, lots to see and do, my Grandson was mesmerised by the animals, even though his attention span is short. We arrived at 11.30",
          "Rather than a traditional zoo, this is a park with the additional bonus of animals! The enclosures are well spread out so be prepared to walk a long way or have to miss some of the animals. We wish we had taken more notice of the big map at the entrance or picked up a leaflet",
          "The zoo has lots of animals spread out in large open-air enclosures, so come prepared for a bit of walk in the fresh air. There are benches and shade, and free water taps, so make it a picnic day: it's free entrance and free parking! The only paid bit is the amazonian",
          "We weren't expecting too much and are used to visiting Colchester zoo quite frequently. However we had a good day out and were pleasantly surprised. Arrived at midday in August but despite this it wasn't particularly crowded. We paid <\u20ac20 for 2 ad 3 ch to go in the Amazonian",
          "We were a little skeptical having read the reviews, but this was a very pleasurable experience. As members of London Zoo, we knew we wouldn't see what we saw there, but we saw the White Rhinos, giraffes, zebra and plenty more. What we particularly liked was seeing so many",
          "It is not really a zoo but a park with animals. It is quite big and would have been a really nice walk if not in July when the temperature was in the late 30's. Take drinks and snacks with you as there is nowhere inside to buy anything. It is free and definitely worth the visit.",
          "I happen to live 30 mins walk away from the zoo, so i find myself here quite often. It's always full of people and shows how popular it is with kids. its awesome to walk around. there is a small lake inside with ducks and benches nearby, great for picnics. And it is free with",
          "I'm s not really a zoo but a park. If you are ok to walk around with lengthy empty segment then you're ok. If not do something else because it's boring the animals are in tiny cages and you can't really access the rest. So it's boring and were never gonna come back",
          "This attraction is free except for the Amazon experience which is a small fee and well worth it. The good thing and bad thing is the same thing. The animals are given a lot of room in their enclosures consequently the have lots of room to hide and also each enclose is a long",
          "It is must visit when you are in Montpellier! It is free, perfect green area with not sooo many animals, but nice to have a walk",
          "I've taken my kids to this zoo on a few occasions. Honestly, in the summer months it can be very hot (no surprise) but in the winter months especially, the facility is well designed; plenty of space to roam but the animals are not too far apart. Lots of families but people",
          "We travelled by tram to St.Eloi stop and then on to the navette(free if you show tram ticket).There is plenty of parking if you go by car. The zooo covers 80 hectares with 11 kms of tracks.There are all sorts of endangered animals. some of which I had never seen before. They are",
          "For a free of charge zoo, it was great. Lots of variety of animals and wide spaces for picnic to enjoy the southern sun. 10 min from the city center (using the tram +bus), the zoo is worth the visit.",
          "Nice place for a stroll, good for picnics, the free entry is excellent, The animals don't always co-operate and stay hidden, especially on sunny days.",
          "I'm not normally a great fan of zoo's because I don't like seeing animals in being confined. But here, there is sooo much space for them to move around it, that I felt very comfortable and really enjoyed looking at the very wide range of different species they have here! The",
          "Free General Admission. Fantastic walk through area with lemurs & other animals. You can pay extra to see a amazon greenhouse exhibit with some additional animals. Large spacious zoo, you can get quite close to some of the animals. A lot of the exhibits were closed/empty when",
          "The Zoo de Lunaret is a beautiful location to go to for leisure. Animals are well taken care of as are the flora. But it is also a place where one can excercise, run or picnic and relax. Accessable to all ages and with good utilities. The only minor: all information in the Zoo",

          "A hidden treasure - this is a large zoo with large 'pens' for all the animals. There is a good mix of animals with great signs with lots of information (if you speak French!)",
          "Since its free I'd have to say its good but there are some areas where animals are nowhere to be found so it was a bit disappointing. It is nice though, great to go for a walk on a nice sunny day.",
          "This is a great place to have a walk, away from the city. But be careful of the season cause the animals are inside when its too cold or when its rainning.",
          "Very nice, and free, zoo in the middle of a green oak and pine trees forest. Sometimes hard to spot animals as they are in open sapce rather than cages, but just walking in the park is a nice and relaxing experience.",
          "This parc is well worth a visit if you want to spend the day out in a zoo. You could do a whole day here if you brought a picnic and plenty of places to have it. Warm weather tends to make the animals lethargic and occasionally hard to spot as they take shelter but considering",
          "I visited the zoo with my family and we absolutely loved it. It is free, great for an afternoon walk and there are a lots and lots of animals, I think 1 300 animals in all,and written explanations about the animals Staff are helpful and friendly. The place is also very clean and",

          "I visited on a warm day 11 September 2014 and there seemed to be very few other people there. As others have commented, there's a lot of walking to do at this site. Apparently there's 11km of paths, although I didn't do all that! Also, there's much work going on at the site",
          "I've been visiting Montpellier for the last 30 years and the zoo has always been on the agenda. Younger we used to have picnic there next to a small lake, feeding fishes with bread. They have plenty of animals (Giraffe, Bear, Lion, Hypo, Monkey, Wolf, ...) but after visiting",
          "We enjoyed our half day with the family at the parck zoologique Henri de Lunaret. Prepare for a lot of walking so put on a good shoes!",
          "The only good thing about this Zoo was that is free. The Zoo is placed in woodland area most of the time you walking on un even and very dusty alleyways ( not pushchair friendly ) When we visited it was a hot day, most of the animals were not to be seen or hiding in shade, too",
          "I had to take the tram and bus to get to this zoo. To see each animal it was a long trek and the weather was hot too, make sure you bring bottles of water to drink. The animals looked healthy but they were always hiding or resting out of the hot sun so we did not see very much.",
          "The zoo is a bit out of the way to get to (about 30 min from Com\u00e8die if you don't have to wait for a bus at the transfer in St. \u00c9loi), and we chose only to see the free section, but we loved the natural stroll though the pine-tree dotted hills... And of course seeing the",
          "So, we went to the zoo with high hopes - having looked online and seen fantastic photos - some as recent as June 2014, there were cheetahs, bears, lions and wolves - 2 of which aren't available at our local zoo. After aimlessly driving round in the busy car parks - yes plural we",
          "When on holiday in the Languedoc region, en route to Montpellier, my parents told my sister and I they had a surprise for us. We had no idea just how bad it would be. As we neared our destination, we saw signs for a \"zoo\". As expected we were excited. It was free, what could be",
          "We went today on a blisteringly hot day, so only walked to the lion & monkey enclosures after doing the Amazonian Greenhouse which has some amazing creatures inside - even one that this zoo addict had never seen before (a Coendou). The enclosures are huge, which is probably why",
          "This is one of the best Zoos I have ever been to. It is very large and can easily swallow an entire afternoon so it's definitely worth bringing a picnic. There are loads of benches to stop at. There is a wealth of amazing wildlife on show here. There are very large enclosures",
          "We have visited the premises last year, a part of our visit to Montpellier. It is one of the attractions listed for that area and we thought it would be a good fun for our little daughter. The zoo is such a big one and requires a lot of walking, which is exhausting. After a",
          "We walked the 3 miles here and 3 miles back from the city centre and the zoo itself is quite large so another few miles there. The zoo is free of charge and the animals have large spaces so sometimes hard to spot them. This was fine with us as the quality of living is obviously",
          "I love this place as a place for a family stroll, but if you're expecting a proper zoo then this isn't the place for you. It's more like a large park with animals dotted around that you happen to come across. It's great for children and for running. Plus it's free!",
          "If you're looking for a place to run, that's the best place for that. It's free to enter and got really good place for a run in the dirt.",
          "Be warned - this place is extremely big. You will need a couple of visits to get around it all. Our two little boys (4 and nearly 2) found it hard-going but enjoyed themselves. I would also not rely on the zoo for lunch as the caf\u00e9 doesn't look too inviting. That the zoo is a",

          "We decided to visit the zoo this year as we had done the safari park the previous year. It is free in and there is a small fee for special exhibits if you want to go in. However it is a huge zoo and takes several hours to get around, which is fine if its not too hot ( which it",
          "We visited on a hot day in August, which may have affected our perception of this zoo. The grounds are extensive and be prepared for a lot of walking with some hilly bits - if you have small children you may want to take a buggy. There is not much shade so bottles of water and",

          "A bit of walking, yes. But really beautiful! The nature, ths smell of the trees. And then all the animaly in huuge places. I really liked it. Also the little jungle house (6.50 Euro) is worth it.",
          "This is a delight - the zoo is laid out in roaming areas according to the continents and you can see a host of wildlife in as close to natural conditions as possible. The main park is free of charge and covers several acres with picnic facilities. Across from the zoo is another",
          "This place is so big and the animal enclosures are spaced far apart. You'll need to be prepared to walk kilometres and if you're pushing a stroller, it will be hard work. There's some pretty steep hills for tiring out your little one's legs as well as gravel paths which were",
          "We went on one of the warmest days of our holiday and we struggled. Entrance to the park is free so I have no complaints about the cost! But the enclosures were so big and far apart that we seemed to spend longer slogging from enclosure to enclosure than looking at animals.",
          "I visited the Park on a sunny Sunday. It was filled with families enjoying the outing. It is very child-friendly, and all the areas are well-marked. It is great for viewing the animals, taking pictures, or even sitting at the cafe enjoying the people having fun.",
          "We managed to navigate our way to the zoo this week and was impressed with the variety of the animals to see, some of the enclosures could have more grass for the animals to eat and less stones as part of their pastures, lots of walking but plenty of places to rest and picnic,",
          "I'm not sure what the other reviewers are looking for... I have been staying in Montpellier every summer for a number of years, but this fall was the first time that I ventured out to the zoo (even though it isn't all that far away). I liked it enough that I went 3 times, twice",
          "rather an old-fashioned zoo - not the ideal - but for kids and parents looking for a green and refreshing spot, it's a good choice",
          "This zoo is free; perhaps they should charge admission and try to liven it up. Some of the animals were cool, but basically we went because it was a beautiful day to be outside. The signs are sorely lacking. The attached Botanical Garden, however, was worth its separate",

          "I thik that the ZOo of Montpellier needs more work and maintenance. It is sad to see some animals and how they are in small spaces for people to see. Rinos for example are in a really limited space but people cannot complain that they cannot see them. I think that if you live in",

          "I'm not a big zoo fan but this zoo is ok by my standards. They take good care of their animals, there is a lot of place for them to run around with a great variety. It's a nice outing for a sunday afternoon. By hot weather make sure to bring a hat and water it can get really",
          "Love that such a great place is free to enter. I enjoyed walking up and down the hills and the good views of the area surrounding Montpellier, as well as the native forest. The animals are clearly well cared for and you sometimes can't see them - a good sign that they have space",
          "Montpellier's main zoo is free! Easy to get there by tram and then bus. You can get good views of rhinos, giraffes, bears and Iberia wolves in particular. Animal enclosures are supplemented by wooden statues of the animals for kids to climb on. It's a bit of a walk, with",
          "Great zoo. Bring a picnic and plenty of water as walk around takes over two hours with young children. But take your time and the surroundings are lovely, as are the animals. The enclosures are large and some animals (leopard) are hard to see, but that gives feeling that the",
          "It's easy to get to on the tram, it's a little different to English ones, the animals are spread out over a lot more land and it's very hilly, make sure you have water with you and comfortable shoes, we took about 2-3 hours to walk round.",
          "This zoo seems a forest. You don\u00b4t feel like \"jails\". Paths between trees drive you to animal locations, wide spaces. No big holes separations, but no sense of danger, near a wild life real experience Free entry! Amazonia has a separae building with amazonic forest and",
          "This zoo is fantastic for people of all ages, we had such a great time at this zoo and it was a nice walk between each animal. There is a free map provided which helps you find your way round. There is also a bus which runs there frequently and it is really easy to get too. It",
          "A different kind of zoo, with a lot of paths and spaces (forested areas) between the animals. No guarantee that you will see animals in the area. Great restaurant near the entrance. We didn't go into the Rain-forest area, but could see into a section from the second floor of the",
          "This zoo is one of the best I've been with my four and nine year olds - and we've been to a fair few! Whilst entry to the Zoo is free, it's worth paying a few extra Euros to enter the 'Serre Amazonienne' which offers an extensive display of Amazonian flora and fauna. It also",
          "We've been enjoying this zoo for many many years. We've watched the zoo evolve over the years and appreciate the spaces and greenery allotted to the animals. Your little ones can opt for smaller trails and your older kids can do the longer distances. Arrive early or outside",
          "Located a bit away from the center, the zoo is in a very nice and maintained park. You can easily walk around with kids and see a bunch of animals. Pretty cheap as well, it was a great activity",
          "The zoo is big and have interesting animals. They have bathroom and water during the path. My complains are that they should put more signs pointing where to go to see each animal (no signs on intersections) and several animals where not visible when we passed through.",
          "A nice and calming experience, great for kids... not sure if adults would enjoy it if they've been to a bigger zoo. Still, it was well organized and a nice way to pass an hour or two.",
          "This place is free, apart from the amazon rainforest house bit. It's a good space, with nice long walks possible. It's not overly commercialised inside with only one cafe and gift shop at the entrance, which both offered reasonably priced goods. There are picnic spots inside",
          "Great day out, lots of animals to see and well laid out and a great children's play area. Great restaurant and very children friendly.",
          "Excellent day out for kids all ages in this lovely Zoo and park in which animals are semi-free and entrance is free! It is a short bus ride from the town.",
          "For a zoo it was ok. The Amazone rain forest was for me the best part. Entry into the zoo is free but there is a charge for the rain forest part. The animals in the main zoo have smaller enclosures than most zoos I have been to. We felt bad for certain animals. Lots of",
          "How this is zoo is free is beyond me. They could easily charge \u20ac10 for entry. We seen plenty of animals and got really close to some we never gave before. Particularly enjoyed the lions, bears and zebras! Fairly easy to get to by the tram and then we walked up to the zoo about",
          "Visited the zoo and it is free entry which is great, seeing the animals was amazing however there were a lot of empty enclosures and found ourselves to be walking around for ages without seeing anything. It was a very quiet day when we visited so perhaps that is why but didn't",
          "We really enjoyed this zoo as it is really a park with animals! It was great to walk in the shade ( it was very hot) and discover the animal enclosures. Amazing that it is free! The restaurant was also surprisingly good-we ate excellent salads there. Easy to get to using public",
          "We took out 4 boys on a hot day. we visited the rain forest area first and that was worth the entry fees. lots of birds,animal, insect and fish life to see.This took about an hour, all the boys enjoyed this area and generated lots of questions from them. The main zoo is free and",
          "The park itself makes for a nice walk but Im not too keen on the size/conditions of some of the enclosures.",
          "Just don't go when it's really hot the animals will be hiding in the shade. There's a lot for picnicking and walking. You could make this the main activity and it's free!",
          "No elephants here but it is a huge zoo. Rather rough walking if you are pushing a stroller. Lots of hills. Go early in the morning to take advantage of the shade as the zoo is large and very spread out.",
          "Big zoo and it's free. But to be fair: nothing spectacular and similar to other, average zoos. But if you've some free time...",
          "Average at best, but for a free attraction worth a trip if you're looking for a something to do for a few hours. There is a tropical section which you have to pay to enter, this was better than the main zoo but still quite limited.",
          "Had read reviews that this was a free zoo and two thoughts sprang to mind... Only for locals carrying a council tax bill paid up in full or there will be a dog, cat and three fish! On arriving the car park was free, good start... We got to the entrance and a queue at a kiosk",
          "A small zoo, but with some interesting animals. An easy tram and bus ride to get there. Nice walking trails.",
          "If you are in Montpellier, the Parc Zoologic is definitely worth a visit. The place is slighltl off the city main beaten track but it\u2019s well connected anyway. It\u2019s free and the animal collection is good. The enclosures are quite big (but some of them have high rough vegetation",
          "The zoo is free which is great ! You can pay to go to the indoor tropical bit, but we didn't do that. Animals are well spread out so the park doesn't get busy. Great for a relaxed walk around in the sun. Make sure you give yourself some time as we had to go twice to get through",
          "The zoo is amazing, there is a vast amount of wildlife to see like Rhinoceros Zebra Giraffe and many other species you would not see in a UK zoo. The zoo is absolutely free although there is a small change to enter the rain forest section but it is well worth the entrance fee.",
          "This zoo park is really beautiful with alot of exotic animals that I actually hadn't seen before I came here. It's pretty amazing that they actually give you all of it for free! Definitely worth a visit but just remember that if it's really hot it could be hard to cope the heat",
          "Visiting the Zoo in Montpellier is a very nice way to spend the afternoon. There are a lot of animal species and it values your money for sure: because it's free!",
          "The zoo is perfect, especially with children ! Even though it's free (which is why I went there a few times!) there are many animals and it's clean and perfect for a walk with your family/friends. It always depends on the day/hour what animals you will see but I would definitely",
          "A large zoo with lot of international program to save different animals. More over it is free entrance. Juste on the side you can visit (not free) lot of birds from Amazonia",
          "Very interesting and different compared to other zoo's that I have visited. The inclosures was big and build so as to remind of the animals natural habitat",
          "It is named a zoo but it is more like a park for me, it is free apart from some parts, it is really nice to walk around but this is more a place for local families to spend their weekends so it is impossible to find a parking place. Well; you can also come by bike if you know",
          "We couldn't believe that the zoo was completely free to visit. Apparently there is an indoor area that requires an entrance fee, but we didn't bother with that as there was plenty to see outside. The zoo seems to be treated as an ordinary park by the locals - there were lots",
          "Our children love this zoo! They have big, natural habitats, happy animals, and miles of shaded paths to walk along, enough to tire out the entire family! We also bring our Daily English ESL students here, and it is always a favourite activity among them! My favourites are the",
          "I visited this zoo two times with friends. Huge territory with different kinds of animals. It is possible to see animals closely. I enjoyed this place. But suggest to take a hat and some water with you. In summer it is really hot and on such a big territory it is difficult to",
          "Please note this is not a zoo in the accepted sense, it is a park that has interesting botanical specimens and happens to have some wild animals in decent enclosures. Animals are mostly from Africa and include: small monkeys, giraffe, rhino, cheetah, lion, zebra, and antelope.",
          "The Zoo is a little way out of the centre. We took the tram, followed by an uphill walk of around half an hour. There may be buses which go nearer. Entry is free, except for a tropical house near the entrance, which we did not go into. The grounds are extensive. The animals have",
          "Entrance is free, which was a big bonus. The serre is paying but did not enter here. As the zoo was free, we were a bit hesitant about the conditions, but actually the parc is really great. A lot of open space, it's not cage after cage, but u can walk for a while in a nature",
          "The cost of getting to the zoo was cheap - 6 euros for up to 5 people (and lasts 24hrs). The zoo is free. The only downside is that you need to be prepared to walk as the zoo is enormous and the animals spread apart - although, the scenery was enjoyable. Its also a good spot if",
          "A wonderful half-day visit to a zoo, perfect for a cloudy day. The main zoo is free of charge, the indoor section was \u20ac6,50 for adults. Both are well worth visiting. The zoo is large and has many different species, from lions and leopards to giraffes and rhinos. The enclosures",
          "If you've got a couple of hours to wander around, the Montpellier Zoo is excellent. It is free, well designed, and perfect for strolling.",
          "One of the best places for Sunday afternoon walks in Montpellier I'd say :) A lot of animals, if you're lucky you can even the Lions. Main advantage, it's for free !!! If you notice a stop entry, it's only for the amazonian greenhouse on the right side FYI, no need to pay",
          "First of all you can't beat the price (it's free!). We started by looking for felines, and neither the cougar nor the lions were anywhere to be seen. Other parts of the zoo were much better, and we got some nice sightings of rhinos, giraffes, ostriches and some more. The",
          "While to get around this zoo takes a lot of walking a really stuffed full afternoon, or more relaxing full day, this is a great zoo for the animals. The property is expansive and varied terrain. While all this space can make it harder to see all the animals (the day we were",
          "We went there with the grandchildren - a marvelous day (it took all day indeed) - we went seeing animals and went back on request. The wooden carved animals add to the magic In short - with children/grandchildren do not miss the place",
          "We visited and had low expectations due to some of the reviews, but were pleasantly surprised. It's quite a sprawling and hilly site, with little shade. There is a nice playground for the kids and drinking water fountains scattered around the site. There are not lots of",
          "We had a fantastic day at the park Zoologique today. It is unbelievable that this pale is free of charge. Both the entrance and parking. It was lovely, lots to see and do, my Grandson was mesmerised by the animals, even though his attention span is short. We arrived at 11.30",
          "Rather than a traditional zoo, this is a park with the additional bonus of animals! The enclosures are well spread out so be prepared to walk a long way or have to miss some of the animals. We wish we had taken more notice of the big map at the entrance or picked up a leaflet",
          "The zoo has lots of animals spread out in large open-air enclosures, so come prepared for a bit of walk in the fresh air. There are benches and shade, and free water taps, so make it a picnic day: it's free entrance and free parking! The only paid bit is the amazonian",
          "We weren't expecting too much and are used to visiting Colchester zoo quite frequently. However we had a good day out and were pleasantly surprised. Arrived at midday in August but despite this it wasn't particularly crowded. We paid <\u20ac20 for 2 ad 3 ch to go in the Amazonian",
          "We were a little skeptical having read the reviews, but this was a very pleasurable experience. As members of London Zoo, we knew we wouldn't see what we saw there, but we saw the White Rhinos, giraffes, zebra and plenty more. What we particularly liked was seeing so many",
          "It is not really a zoo but a park with animals. It is quite big and would have been a really nice walk if not in July when the temperature was in the late 30's. Take drinks and snacks with you as there is nowhere inside to buy anything. It is free and definitely worth the visit.",
          "I happen to live 30 mins walk away from the zoo, so i find myself here quite often. It's always full of people and shows how popular it is with kids. its awesome to walk around. there is a small lake inside with ducks and benches nearby, great for picnics. And it is free with",
          "I'm s not really a zoo but a park. If you are ok to walk around with lengthy empty segment then you're ok. If not do something else because it's boring the animals are in tiny cages and you can't really access the rest. So it's boring and were never gonna come back",
          "This attraction is free except for the Amazon experience which is a small fee and well worth it. The good thing and bad thing is the same thing. The animals are given a lot of room in their enclosures consequently the have lots of room to hide and also each enclose is a long",
          "It is must visit when you are in Montpellier! It is free, perfect green area with not sooo many animals, but nice to have a walk",
          "I've taken my kids to this zoo on a few occasions. Honestly, in the summer months it can be very hot (no surprise) but in the winter months especially, the facility is well designed; plenty of space to roam but the animals are not too far apart. Lots of families but people",
          "We travelled by tram to St.Eloi stop and then on to the navette(free if you show tram ticket).There is plenty of parking if you go by car. The zooo covers 80 hectares with 11 kms of tracks.There are all sorts of endangered animals. some of which I had never seen before. They are",
          "For a free of charge zoo, it was great. Lots of variety of animals and wide spaces for picnic to enjoy the southern sun. 10 min from the city center (using the tram +bus), the zoo is worth the visit.",
          "Nice place for a stroll, good for picnics, the free entry is excellent, The animals don't always co-operate and stay hidden, especially on sunny days.",
          "I'm not normally a great fan of zoo's because I don't like seeing animals in being confined. But here, there is sooo much space for them to move around it, that I felt very comfortable and really enjoyed looking at the very wide range of different species they have here! The",
          "Free General Admission. Fantastic walk through area with lemurs & other animals. You can pay extra to see a amazon greenhouse exhibit with some additional animals. Large spacious zoo, you can get quite close to some of the animals. A lot of the exhibits were closed/empty when",
          "The Zoo de Lunaret is a beautiful location to go to for leisure. Animals are well taken care of as are the flora. But it is also a place where one can excercise, run or picnic and relax. Accessable to all ages and with good utilities. The only minor: all information in the Zoo",

          "A hidden treasure - this is a large zoo with large 'pens' for all the animals. There is a good mix of animals with great signs with lots of information (if you speak French!)",
          "Since its free I'd have to say its good but there are some areas where animals are nowhere to be found so it was a bit disappointing. It is nice though, great to go for a walk on a nice sunny day.",
          "This is a great place to have a walk, away from the city. But be careful of the season cause the animals are inside when its too cold or when its rainning.",
          "Very nice, and free, zoo in the middle of a green oak and pine trees forest. Sometimes hard to spot animals as they are in open sapce rather than cages, but just walking in the park is a nice and relaxing experience.",
          "This parc is well worth a visit if you want to spend the day out in a zoo. You could do a whole day here if you brought a picnic and plenty of places to have it. Warm weather tends to make the animals lethargic and occasionally hard to spot as they take shelter but considering",
          "I visited the zoo with my family and we absolutely loved it. It is free, great for an afternoon walk and there are a lots and lots of animals, I think 1 300 animals in all,and written explanations about the animals Staff are helpful and friendly. The place is also very clean and",
          "The zoo is in a very nice spacious environment. There's many great animals to see and the best thing about it all, is that it's free.",
          "I visited on a warm day 11 September 2014 and there seemed to be very few other people there. As others have commented, there's a lot of walking to do at this site. Apparently there's 11km of paths, although I didn't do all that! Also, there's much work going on at the site",
          "I've been visiting Montpellier for the last 30 years and the zoo has always been on the agenda. Younger we used to have picnic there next to a small lake, feeding fishes with bread. They have plenty of animals (Giraffe, Bear, Lion, Hypo, Monkey, Wolf, ...) but after visiting",
          "We enjoyed our half day with the family at the parck zoologique Henri de Lunaret. Prepare for a lot of walking so put on a good shoes!",
          "The only good thing about this Zoo was that is free. The Zoo is placed in woodland area most of the time you walking on un even and very dusty alleyways ( not pushchair friendly ) When we visited it was a hot day, most of the animals were not to be seen or hiding in shade, too",
          "I had to take the tram and bus to get to this zoo. To see each animal it was a long trek and the weather was hot too, make sure you bring bottles of water to drink. The animals looked healthy but they were always hiding or resting out of the hot sun so we did not see very much.",
          "The zoo is a bit out of the way to get to (about 30 min from Com\u00e8die if you don't have to wait for a bus at the transfer in St. \u00c9loi), and we chose only to see the free section, but we loved the natural stroll though the pine-tree dotted hills... And of course seeing the",
          "So, we went to the zoo with high hopes - having looked online and seen fantastic photos - some as recent as June 2014, there were cheetahs, bears, lions and wolves - 2 of which aren't available at our local zoo. After aimlessly driving round in the busy car parks - yes plural we",
          "When on holiday in the Languedoc region, en route to Montpellier, my parents told my sister and I they had a surprise for us. We had no idea just how bad it would be. As we neared our destination, we saw signs for a \"zoo\". As expected we were excited. It was free, what could be",
          "We went today on a blisteringly hot day, so only walked to the lion & monkey enclosures after doing the Amazonian Greenhouse which has some amazing creatures inside - even one that this zoo addict had never seen before (a Coendou). The enclosures are huge, which is probably why",
          "This is one of the best Zoos I have ever been to. It is very large and can easily swallow an entire afternoon so it's definitely worth bringing a picnic. There are loads of benches to stop at. There is a wealth of amazing wildlife on show here. There are very large enclosures",
          "We have visited the premises last year, a part of our visit to Montpellier. It is one of the attractions listed for that area and we thought it would be a good fun for our little daughter. The zoo is such a big one and requires a lot of walking, which is exhausting. After a",
          "We walked the 3 miles here and 3 miles back from the city centre and the zoo itself is quite large so another few miles there. The zoo is free of charge and the animals have large spaces so sometimes hard to spot them. This was fine with us as the quality of living is obviously",
          "I love this place as a place for a family stroll, but if you're expecting a proper zoo then this isn't the place for you. It's more like a large park with animals dotted around that you happen to come across. It's great for children and for running. Plus it's free!",
          "If you're looking for a place to run, that's the best place for that. It's free to enter and got really good place for a run in the dirt.",
          "Be warned - this place is extremely big. You will need a couple of visits to get around it all. Our two little boys (4 and nearly 2) found it hard-going but enjoyed themselves. I would also not rely on the zoo for lunch as the caf\u00e9 doesn't look too inviting. That the zoo is a",
          "Although there are not that many animals and birds as some zoos, the one they have are in well-managed naturalized settings. The zoo is spread out, so walking the whole thing with small children could be a challenge. The animals are from all over the world, some rare or",
          "This was a lot different from most zoos as it's very spaced out so be prepared for a lot of walking to each exhibit. The rainforest section was 6 euros and was definitely worth it and made the whole trip with while",
          "We decided to visit the zoo this year as we had done the safari park the previous year. It is free in and there is a small fee for special exhibits if you want to go in. However it is a huge zoo and takes several hours to get around, which is fine if its not too hot ( which it",
          "We visited on a hot day in August, which may have affected our perception of this zoo. The grounds are extensive and be prepared for a lot of walking with some hilly bits - if you have small children you may want to take a buggy. There is not much shade so bottles of water and",

          "This zoo is great \u2013 expect to do some walking \u2013 and if you are traveling with children like we were \u2013 try to take full day (4-6h). It is more fun in my opinion to have more time and not having to drag children on a high speed. The park is well maintained and in fact one of the",
          "A bit of walking, yes. But really beautiful! The nature, ths smell of the trees. And then all the animaly in huuge places. I really liked it. Also the little jungle house (6.50 Euro) is worth it.",
          "This is a delight - the zoo is laid out in roaming areas according to the continents and you can see a host of wildlife in as close to natural conditions as possible. The main park is free of charge and covers several acres with picnic facilities. Across from the zoo is another",
          "This place is so big and the animal enclosures are spaced far apart. You'll need to be prepared to walk kilometres and if you're pushing a stroller, it will be hard work. There's some pretty steep hills for tiring out your little one's legs as well as gravel paths which were",
          "We went on one of the warmest days of our holiday and we struggled. Entrance to the park is free so I have no complaints about the cost! But the enclosures were so big and far apart that we seemed to spend longer slogging from enclosure to enclosure than looking at animals.",
          "I visited the Park on a sunny Sunday. It was filled with families enjoying the outing. It is very child-friendly, and all the areas are well-marked. It is great for viewing the animals, taking pictures, or even sitting at the cafe enjoying the people having fun.",
          "We managed to navigate our way to the zoo this week and was impressed with the variety of the animals to see, some of the enclosures could have more grass for the animals to eat and less stones as part of their pastures, lots of walking but plenty of places to rest and picnic,",
          "I'm not sure what the other reviewers are looking for... I have been staying in Montpellier every summer for a number of years, but this fall was the first time that I ventured out to the zoo (even though it isn't all that far away). I liked it enough that I went 3 times, twice",
          "rather an old-fashioned zoo - not the ideal - but for kids and parents looking for a green and refreshing spot, it's a good choice",
          "This zoo is free; perhaps they should charge admission and try to liven it up. Some of the animals were cool, but basically we went because it was a beautiful day to be outside. The signs are sorely lacking. The attached Botanical Garden, however, was worth its separate",
          "The good news is that it's free. The bad news is that it's more of a park than a zoo. You'll do a lot of walking and see very, very few animals. If you just want to spend a day outside walking around a nice park, it's great. If you really want to be at a zoo and see critters,",

          "A free zoo set in a forest is a fantastic day out, but as I say if the day is a little warm (or 40 odd degrees in our case) the animals wisely hide in the shade well away from sight. Still get to see a lot of interesting animals and I do suggest doing the amazon zone for about",

          "Thought we would try out the free zoo for a cheap day out. Spent a lovely day walking around then finished it off with a walk around the Amazon house, about 22 euros for a family of 5. We tried the restaurant at the entrance to the zoo and we were impressed with the quality,",
          "A free zoo. Lots and lots of walking, but the animals make up for that. The conditions for the animals seem very good, with large enclosures (and so lots of walking between these), and it looked to us that on occasion the animals were actually posing. The cerval cat, otter, and",

The building stands on an isthmus between the \u00c9tang de l'Arnel lake and the Mediterranean Sea in the Gulf of Lion, which was once the site of the original city of Maguelone, opposite the present-day town of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Maguelone.\nMaguelone Cathedral was once the episcopal seat of the former Bishop of Maguelone until 1563, when the see was transferred to the newly created Bishopric of Montpellier. The cathedral, constructed when the see was returned here in the 11th century from Substantion by Bishop Arnaud (1030-1060), is a Romanesque fortified building. Although parts, such as the towers, have been demolished, the main body of the building remains functional and is a registered national monument. It is run by a dedicated preservation society, les Compagnons de Maguelone, and is used for both religious and secular purposes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins of the diocese ===\nDuring archaeological excavations in 1967, Roman and Etruscan remains and a number of Visigothic sarcophagi were discovered on this ancient island. The foundations of a church destroyed in the 7th century were also found.\nAt the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, the Visigoths took over part of the region of Melgueil, the island of Maguelone. Christianity gradually imposed its rule on the area. From 533, a bishopric was established on the island. The first bishops were Boethius (until 589), Genies (or Genesius, 597-633?) and a church-cathedral existed on the island. The bishopric of Maguelone appears in the texts at the end of the 6th century, on an island which was said to have been inhabited in antiquity.The reasons for the establishment of the bishopric of Maguelone on this island away from the Via Domitia road and far from any urban area (the city of Montpellier did not yet exist) are not clear, but the island location meant that the bishopric was accessible only by sea, offering some protection.  As well as being the episcopal seat, Maguelone was also the seat of Gothic Counts, which ensured the presence of temporal power.Although Maguelone was well protected on the inland side, its strategic position meant that it was very vulnerable to invasions from the sea; in 673, the Visigoth King Wamba was besieged here during his campaign of reconquest of Narbonne.\n\n\n=== Port Saracen ===\nDuring the 8th century, the power of the Visigoths weakened and eventually the Kingdom of Toledo collapsed, allowing the Saracens in Spain to increase their attacks on Christian states. After the conquest of Catalonia, Saracen armies crossed the Pyrenees in 715 and took control of the whole region of Septimania in 719.\nMaguelone, because of its key position, was renamed Port Sarrasin (Port Saracen), probably a fortified place. A harbour was established allowing ships to dock and unload their cargo safely. Today an area called the Sarrazine corresponds to an inlet (Grau in Occitan) which was the site of these constructions. Despite the Muslim invasion, freedom of worship was maintained on the island, its inhabitants being granted the status of dhimmi (\"protected person\" in Arabic).\nIn response to the invasion, the Franks began their campaign of reconquest. Following the Battle of Poitiers in 732, the Saracens gradually abandoned the south of France, pursued by Charles Martel. In 737, after Martel's failure to reconquer Septimania, he destroyed the first cathedral at Maguelone which had been converted into a mosque by the Saracens. The architecture of the original building remains unknown.\nSince then the site remained virtually abandoned for three centuries, although it seems that Maguelone continued to support a precarious settlement despite the threat of pirates. The bishop of Maguelone moved his seat a few kilometres north-east to the ancient oppidum named Substantion, the site of the present-day municipality of Castelnau-le-Lez, in the County of Melgueil (present-day Mauguio).\n\n\n=== 11th century revival ===\nFrom 1030, Arnaud, Bishop of Maguelone from 1029 to 1060, decided to rebuild the cathedral at Maguelone. He adopted a chapter of twelve Canons Regular, after the Rule of St. Augustine. A chapel adjoining the south of the cathedral building is dedicated to St. Augustine, which survives today.\nTo improve access to the city, which could only be reached by boat, Arnaud built a bridge nearly 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) in length which stretched from the island to Villeneuve-les-Maguelone, which was placed in the charge of a dignitary of the chapter. He also erected fortifications to protect the site from attacks by Muslims.Bishop Arnaud and his successors were subject to the suzerainty of the Counts of Melgueil. In 1085 the Counts bequeathed their rights over the diocese to Pope Gregory VII. They received many donations; Maguelone, now the property of the Holy See and a safe haven, was flourishing. Pope Urban II visited the island in 1096, and proclaimed that Maguelone Cathedral was \"second only to that of Rome.\"\n\n\n=== 12th & 13th centuries: Peak of the Bishopric of Maguelone ===\n\nWith political and ecclesiastical turmoil raging Italy, a number of pontiffs who fled to France found refuge at Maguelone; Pope Gelasius II was given sanctuary here in 1118, as was Pope Alexander III in 1163, who dedicated the newly built high altar when at Maguelone.\nThe prestige and the increased wealth of the diocese lead to the construction of a new cathedral, replacing the building that dated back to the episcopate of Arnaud. Three bishops led this major undertaking: Bishop Galtier (1104-1129) built the chevet and apse, and the wide fortified transept; Bishop Raymond (1129-1158) continued this work with the construction of the high altar, the episcopal throne and the two towers at the bottom of the transept; and finally, Jean de Montlaur (1161-1190) built the Romanesque nave, calling for the participation of the faithful.\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, two towers were built to defend the western front, Saint John's Tower and the Bishop's Tower (now partially ruined), ensuring the diocese was securely protected. During the Albigensian Crusade, Maguelone remained a bastion of the papacy: Melgueil County, property of the Count of Toulouse Raymond VI, was put under the rule of Maguelone by Pope Innocent III. The archdeacon of Maguelone at this time was Pierre de Castelnau, the papal legate in Languedoc, whose murder in Saint-Gilles in 1208 triggered hostilities against the Cathars.\n\n\n=== Decay and abandonment ===\n\nThe prosperous bishopric of Maguelone aroused the envy of the Kingdoms of France and Aragon. In the 15th century the bishop moved his residence to Montpellier while the canons remained in Maguelone, managed by the provost of the cathedral chapter. The see was abolished in 1536 and the bishop then settled permanently in Montpellier. The canons sold off the monastic buildings, which gradually fell into ruin. The fortified cathedral, now a Protestant stronghold, was partially demolished in 1632 on the orders of Cardinal Richelieu. Sections of walls were sold in 1708 for use in the construction of the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te which connects the nearby Thau lagoon at S\u00e8te to the Rh\u00f4ne River.\nSold as national property during the Revolution and classified as a historic monument in 1840, the area of Maguelone was acquired by the historian Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fabrege in 1852 who began a programme of restoration. He carried out excavations which uncovered the cathedral's rich past, rediscovering the foundations of older buildings. He also planted a number of Mediterranean plant species, the island then being totally denuded of trees. Christian worship returned to the cathedral in 1875. Fabrege's son donated the island to the Diocese of Montpellier in 1949.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\n\nIn 1967, an important archaeological project helped to ascertain the age of the site.\nA work assistance centre is now based at the cathedral, managed by the Compagnons de Maguelone, which works to promote the reintegration of adults with learning disabilities, continuing the cathedral's mission of hospitality. The centre's activities include agricultural work, aquaculture, fishing, and outsourcing activities.\nIn 2002, seventeen pale blue and beige-coloured stained-glass windows designed by Robert Morris and produced by Ateliers Duchemin glassmakers were placed in the restored window lights. These designs depict the ripples of a pebble dropped in water.Today, Maguelone hosts le Festival de musique ancienne de Mauguelone, a music festival that is held annually in June in the cathedral by the Friends of the Festival of Maguelone. This popular event for lovers of early music stages performances of medieval and renaissance music in the magnificent setting of the cathedral, as well as baroque music, romantic music and rare or forgotten works.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNotre-Dame des Tables de Montpellier\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRouquette, J., and Villemagne, A., 1912: Cartulaire de Maguelone (4 vols)\nRouquette, J., and Villemagne, A., 1914: Bullaire de l' \u00e9glise de Maguelone (2 vols)\nLugand, Jacques; Nougaret, Jean; Sean-Jean, Robert (1985). \"Ancienne cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Maguelone\".

        "wiki": "Angoul\u00eame (French pronunciation: \u200b[\u0251\u0303\u0261ul\u025b\u02d0m] (listen); Poitevin-Saintongeais: Engoulaeme; Occitan: Engoleime) is a commune, the capital of the Charente department, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of southwestern France.\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as Angoumoisins or Angoumoisines.Located on a plateau overlooking a meander of the Charente River, the city is nicknamed the \"balcony of the southwest\". The city proper's population is a little less than 42,000 but it is the centre of an urban area of 110,000 people extending more than fifteen kilometres (9.3 miles) from east to west.\nFormerly the capital of Angoumois in the Ancien R\u00e9gime, Angoul\u00eame was a fortified town for a long time, and was highly coveted due to its position at the centre of many roads important to communication, so therefore it suffered many sieges. From its tumultuous past, the city, perched on a rocky spur, inherited a large historical, religious, and urban heritage which attracts a lot of tourists.\nNowadays, Angoul\u00eame is at the centre of an agglomeration, which is one of the most industrialised regions between Loire and Garonne (the paper industry was established in the 16th century, a foundry and electromechanical engineering developed more recently). It is also a commercial and administrative city with its own university of technology, and a vibrant cultural life. This life is dominated by the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival, the FFA Angoul\u00eame Francophone Film Festival and the Musiques M\u00e9tisses Festival that contribute substantially to the international renown of the city. Moreover, Angoul\u00eame hosts 40 animation and video game studios that produce half of France's animated production. Currently the city is developing filming for both French television and cinema. Wes Anderson chose Angoul\u00eame for his next movie at the end of 2018.Angoul\u00eame is called \"Ville de l'Image\" which means literally \"City of the Image\".The commune has been awarded four flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAngoul\u00eame is an Acropolis city located on a hill overlooking a loop of the Charente limited in area upstream by the confluence of the Touvre and downstream by the Anguienne and Eaux Claires.\n\n\n=== Location and access ===\nAngoul\u00eame is located at the intersection of a major north\u2013south axis: the N10 Paris-Bayonne; and the east\u2013west axis: the N14 route Central-Europe Atlantique Limoges-Saintes. Angoul\u00eame is also connected to P\u00e9rigueux and Saint-Jean-d'Angely by the D939 and to Libourne by the D674.\n\nBy train: the Paris-Bordeaux line, served mainly by TGV, passes through Angoul\u00eame and the TER Limoges-Saintes provides connections.\nBy water: although the river Charente is currently only used for tourism, it was a communication channel, especially for freight, until the 19th century and the port of l'Houmeau was very busy.The Angoul\u00eame-Cognac International Airport is at Brie-Champniers.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nOld Angoul\u00eame is the old part between the ramparts and the town centre with winding streets and small squares. The city centre is also located on the plateau and was portrayed by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac in \"The Lost Illusions\" as \"the height of grandeur and power\". There is a Castle, a town hall, a prefecture, and a cathedral with grand houses everywhere. Unlike Old Angoul\u00eame, however, the entire city centre was greatly rebuilt in the 19th century.\nSurrounding the city were five old faubourgs: l'Houmeau, Saint-Cybard, Saint-Martin, Saint-Ausone, and la Bussatte. The district of l'Houmeau was described by Balzac as \"based on trade and money\" because this district lived on trade, boatmen, and their scows. The port of l'Houmeau was created in 1280 on the river bank. It marked the beginning of the navigable part from Angoul\u00eame to the sea. Saint-Cybard, on the bank of the Charente, was created around the Abbey of Saint-Cybard then became an industrial area with papermills, especially Le Nil. Saint-Martin - Saint-Ausone is a district composed of two former parishes outside the ramparts. At La Bussatte the Champ de Mars esplanade is now converted into a shopping mall, and adjoins Saint-Gelais.\nToday the city has fifteen districts:\n\nCentre-ville\nOld Angoul\u00eame\nSaint-Ausone - Saint-Martin\nSaint-Gelais\nLa Bussatte - Champ de Mars\nL'Houmeau\nSaint-Cybard\nVictor-Hugo, Saint-Roch is notable for its military presence.\nBasseau is a district which was created in the 19th century with the port of Basseau, the explosives factory in 1821, the Laroche-Joubert papermill in 1842, then the bridge in 1850.\nSillac - La Grande-Garenne was a private housing estate then was built up with HLM units.\nBel-Air, la Grand Font in the railway station district with housing blocks from the 1950s at Grand Font.\nLa Madeleine which was completely rebuilt after the bombings of 1944.\nMa Campagne is a district which was detached from Puymoyen commune in 1945 and built-up as a collective habitat from 1972.\nLe Petit Fresquet was also detached from Puymoyen and is semi-rural.\nFr\u00e9geneuil was also detached from Puymoyen and is semi-rural.\n\n\n=== Panorama of the city ===\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communes and villages ===\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe Port-l'Houmeau, the old port on the Charente located in the district of l'Houmeau is in a flood zone and during floods the Besson Bey Boulevard is usually cut.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nGeologically the town belongs to the Aquitaine Basin as does three-quarters of the western department of Charente.\nThe commune is located on the same limestone from the Upper Cretaceous period which occupies the southern half of the department of Charente, not far from Jurassic formations beginning at Gond-Pontouvre.\nThe earliest Cretaceous period - the Cenomanian- is in the relatively low areas (l'Houmeau, the heights of Saint-Cybard, Sillac), at an average altitude of 50m.\nThe city was established on the Plateau (altitude 100m) that dominates the loop of the River Charente, a Turonian (also called Angoumien) formation which forms a dissected plateau of parallel valleys and a cuesta facing north that extends towards La Couronne to the west and Garat to the east.\nThis limestone plateau contains natural cavities which have been refurbished by man in the form of three or four floors of caves, some of which include antique grain silos.\nThe valley of the Charente is made up of old and new alluvium which provides rich soil for farming and some sandpits. These alluvial deposits were deposited successively during the Quaternary period on the inside of two meanders of the river that are Basseau and Saint-Cybard. The oldest alluviums are on the plain of Basseau and reach a relative height of 25m.\n\n\n=== Relief ===\nThe old part of the city is built on the plateau - a rocky outcrop created by the valleys of the Anguienne and Charente at an altitude of 102 metres (335 feet) - while on the river bank the area subject to flooding is 27 metres (89 feet) high. Angoul\u00eame is characterized by the presence of ramparts on a cliff 80 metres (260 feet) high.\nThe plateau of Ma Campagne, south of the old town, has almost the same features and peaks at 109 m in the woods of Saint-Martin. The plateau is elongated and separates the valleys of Eaux Claires, which is the southern boundary of the commune, from that of Anguienne, which is parallel.\nBoth plateaux overlook the Charente valley and the outlying areas such as l'Houmeau, Basseau, and Sillac at their western ends. The plateau of Angoul\u00eame is the northwest extension of the Soyaux plateau. L'Houmeau, the station area, and that of Grand-Font are to the north of the plateau along the small Vimi\u00e8re valley, also a tributary of the Charente, but further north (towards Gond-Pontouvre and L'Isle-d'Espagnac) than Anguienne is to the south.\nThe highest point of the city of Angoul\u00eame is at an altitude of 133m near Peusec located to the south-east near the border with Puymoyen. The lowest point is 27 m, located along the Charente at Basseau.\n\n\n=== The ramparts ===\nSince Roman times ramparts have surrounded the Plateau of Angoul\u00eame. Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt their reconstruction was finally stopped in the 19th century. The Ramparts are classified as historical monuments and the Ramparts Tour is one of the main attractions of the city.\n\nThe Ramparts of Angoul\u00eame\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAngoul\u00eame is under an oceanic influence and similar to that of the city of Cognac where the departmental weather station is located. Precipitations are modest all year long, with a slight drying tendency during summer.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nSince Antiquity and through the Middle Ages, the name of the town has been attested in many forms in Latin and Old French:\n\nIculisma and Eculisna from the 4th century\ncivitas Engolismensium around 400AD\nEcolisima (Merovingian currency)\nEcolisina and Aquilisima in 511\nEcolisna in the 6th century\nEgolisma\nEgolisina in the 10th century\nEqualisma, Engolma, Egolesma, and Engolisma\nEngolesme at the end of the 12th century.The absence of any convincing explanation of the origin of the name of the city has led to several attempts to fit etymological explanations unrelated to the well documented old forms and phonetically unlikely:\n\nIt came from incolumissima meaning \"very safe and healthy,\" but there is no trace of an [n] in the most ancient forms and no trace of a [mi] either.\nIt was an alteration of in collisn\u0101 meaning \"on the hill\" but a toponym is never formed from the Latin preposition in. As for the French word colline (hill), it was borrowed from the Italian collina at the time of the Renaissance (attested for the first time in 1555). In addition the suffix -isn\u0101 was not used to produce derivations from Latin words and it is doubtful that it even exists. Finally, independent alterations of regular phonetic changes occur as a result of analogy or more precisely of popular etymology: that is to say analogy with other similar and frequent used names in the region or an attempt to connect the toponym to a term that makes sense. It is clear that the old forms of Angoul\u00eame are mostly obscure.Some hypotheses have been advanced with a stronger basis:\n\nIt is possible to recognize the suffix -isma in some of the oldest forms which represents an evolution of the Gallic suffix -isama (usually a superlative mark) which is found in the name of the Gallic divinity Belisama and very common in toponymy in toponymic types such as Blesme, Bell\u00eame, etc. including changes in the final -esme, -\u00eame which is similar to Angoul\u00eame. In this context the first element would be Icul- / Ecol- an unknown pre-Latin element.\nThe identification of the primitive form Eculisna then alternating the old forms -isna and -isma led Ernest N\u00e8gre to prefer the first with -isna. The first element would be Ecul-. According to him, we can neither affirm the Celticity of these two elements nor their meaning. The alteration in *Angulisma was caused by the attraction of the Germanic personal name Angelisma whose existence was confirmed by Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Morlet.\nIculisma / Ecolisma would consist of a Gallic radical eco meaning \"water\", followed by the suffix -lisima meaning \"relates to\". Iculisma would be \"well-watered\". Xavier Delamarre analysed the element Eco- to come from Equoranda (or Egoranda) as the origin of many names in France and considers that the element ico / equo- was not Celtic.At the time of the French Revolution the city was known by the transient name of Montagne-Charente.\nThe district of Bussatte takes its name from the Low Latin buxetta / buxettum which means \"place planted with boxwood\" equivalent to Boissay in the langue d'o\u00efl.\nThe district of l'Houmeau meaning \"small elm\" or \"abalone\". Actually the term is probably derived from the low Latin ulmellum.\nSillac probably comes from the low Latin Siliacum meaning that the village was built around the property (suffix -acum) of a Gallo-Roman named Silius.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe history of the city is not very well known before the Roman period: it is simply known that the plateau was occupied by an oppidum, traces of which were found during excavations in the Saint-Martial cemetery under the name Iculisma. Its currency was Lemovice.\n\nThe town was not located on major roads and was considered by the poet Ausonius as a small town. No Roman monuments have been found but it benefited from the Pax Romana and from trade on the river. The town had a prosperous period at the end of the Roman Empire. The rocky promontory overlooking the Charente 80 metres (260 feet) high and over the Anguienne 60 metres (200 feet) high formed a strategic position. It was raised to the rank of capital of civitas (at the end of the 3rd or 4th centuries) and the first fortress dates from the end of the Roman Empire. The rampart called Bas-Empire which surrounds 27 hectares of land was maintained until the 13th century. The network of Roman roads were then reorganized to link the town with the surrounding cities of Bordeaux, Saintes, Poitiers, Limoges, and P\u00e9rigueux.The city of Haut-Empire remained unknown for a long time. Recent excavations have provided details on the power of the Roman city. A well dug in an early era shows that the water table was very high. A large thermal spa complex was found under the courthouse which is usually related to water supply through an aqueduct.The first bishop of Angoul\u00eame was Saint Ausone of Angoul\u00eame in the 3rd century. The administrative importance of the city was strengthened by the implementation of a County in the 6th century with Turpion (or Turpin) (839\u2013863), adviser to Charles the Bald. However, the town was always attached to the various kingdoms of Aquitaine and the end of antiquity for the city was in 768, when Pepin the Short defeated Hunald II and linked it to the Frankish kingdom. In June 2019, archeologists discovered a prehistoric stone with an engraving of a horse and other animals near Angoul\u00eame station. The Palaeolithic stone plate is estimated to be about 12,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nWhen held by the Visigoths, the city followed the arian version of Christianity and was besieged for the first time by Clovis in 507 after Vouill\u00e9 then taken in 508; \"miraculously\" according to Gregory of Tours and Ademar of Chabannes.During the battle, however, Clovis was seriously wounded in the leg - probably a fracture. The fact is reported by tradition and on a wall of a tower from the 2nd century a leg is carved called the \"leg of Clovis\".\n\nDuring his stay in Angoul\u00eame, after putting the garrison to the sword, Clovis pulled down the old Visigothic cathedral dedicated to Saint-Saturnin to build a new one bearing the name of Saint-Pierre. All that remains of the original building are two carved marble capitals that frame the bay of the axis in the apse of the present cathedral.\nIn the 7th century Saint Cybard stayed secluded in a cave beneath the extension to the north wall of Angoul\u00eame called Green Garden which caused the creation of the first abbey: the Abbey of Saint-Cybard, then created the first abbey for women: the Abbey of Saint-Ausone where the tomb of the first bishop of the city is located.\nIn 848 Angoul\u00eame was sacked by the Viking chief Hastein. In 896 or 930 the city suffered another attack from invading Vikings but this time the Vikings faced an effective resistance. Guillaume I, third Count of Angoul\u00eame, at the head of his troops made them surrender in a decisive battle. During this engagement, he split open to the waist Stonius, the Norman chief, with a massive blow together with his helmet and breastplate. \nIt was this feat that earned him the name Taillefer, which was borne by all his descendants until Isabella of Angoul\u00eame who was also known as Isabelle Taillefer, the wife of King John of England. The title was withdrawn from the descendants on more than one occasion by Richard Coeur-de-Lion then the title passed to King John of England at the time of his marriage to Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, daughter of Count Aymer of Angoul\u00eame. After becoming a widow, Isabella subsequently married Hugh X of Lusignan in 1220, and the title was passed to the Lusignan family, counts of Marche. On the death of Hugh XIII in 1302 without issue, the County of Angoul\u00eame passed his possessions to the crown of France.In 1236 Jewish communities in Anjou and Poitou, particularly Bordeaux and Angoul\u00eame were attacked by crusaders. 500 Jews chose conversion and over 3000 were massacred. Pope Gregory IX, who originally had called the crusade, was outraged about this brutality and criticized the clergy for not preventing it.From the 10th to the 13th centuries the counts of Angoul\u00eame, the Taillefer, then the Lusignan strengthened the defences of the city and widened it to encompass the district of Saint-Martial.\nIn 1110, Bishop Girard II ordered the construction of the present cathedral.\n\n\n=== The commune charter ===\nOn 18 May 1204 a charter was signed by King John of England to make official the creation of the commune of Angoul\u00eame. The King \"grants to residents of Angoul\u00eame to keep the freedoms and customs of their fair city and defend their possessions and rights\". The city celebrated their 800th anniversary throughout 2004.\n\n\n=== The Hundred Years War ===\nIn 1360 the city, like all of Angoumois, passed into the hands of the Plantagenet English with the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny. From 16 to 22 October 1361, John Chandos, Lieutenant of King Edward III of England and the Constable of Aquitaine responsible for implementing the Treaty particularly in Angoumois, took possession of the city, its castles, and the \"mostier\" (monastery) of Saint-Pierre. He received oaths of allegiance to the King of England from the main personalities of the city.The English were, however, expelled in 1373 by the troops of Charles V who granted the town numerous privileges.\nThe County of Angoul\u00eame was given to Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans who was the brother of King Charles VI in 1394 and it then passed to his son Jean d'Orl\u00e9ans (1400\u20131467), the grandfather of Marguerite de Navarre and Fran\u00e7ois I. The Good Count Jean of Angoul\u00eame greatly expanded the County castle after his return from English captivity in the middle of the 15th century.\n\n\n=== The modern era ===\nAngoul\u00eame, the seat of the County of Angoumois, came into the possession of a branch of the family of Valois from which came Fran\u00e7ois I, King of France from 1515 to 1547 who was born in Cognac in 1494. In 1524 the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano returned from the Indies. He told Fran\u00e7ois I he had discovered a new territory that he named New Angoul\u00eame in his honour. This area later became New Amsterdam then New York.\nThe duchy, now crown land, thereafter was passed on within the ruling house of France. One of its holders was Charles of Valois, the \"natural\" (or illegitimate) son of Charles IX. The last duke of Angoul\u00eame was Louis-Antoine (died 1844), eldest son of Charles X of France.John Calvin, the promoter of Protestantism and friend of Jean du Tillet the archdeacon of Angoul\u00eame, was forced to flee Paris in 1533 and took refuge in Angoul\u00eame in the caves of Rochecorail at Trois-Palis. He wrote some of his Institutes of the Christian Religion there which first edition was published in Latin in Basel in 1536.Angoul\u00eame was affected by the Revolt of the Pitauds peasant revolt: in 1541, the gabelle (salt tax) was imposed on Saintonge and Angoumois. These provinces did not pay the tax on salt. The revolt broke out around Angoul\u00eame and farmers from the surrounding countryside took the city in July 1548During the first wars of religion the city took up arms: it was reconquered in 1563 by Montpensier. In 1565 Charles IX passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564\u20131566) accompanied by the court. In October 1568 the city was taken by the Protestants under Coligny.Henry III was, in his infancy, the Duke of Angoul\u00eame. He left an unflattering description: \"The streets of Engolesme are twisted, houses are disordered, the walls built out of various kinds of masonry which show that it was built several times and often taken and ruined\"In 1588 the mayor of Angoul\u00eame, Fran\u00e7ois Normand Lord of Puygrelier, was ordered by Henri III to arrest the Duke of \u00c9pernon, governor of Angoumois. He led the assault, was repelled, and died on 10 August 1588.\nIn 1619 Marie de M\u00e9dicis escaped and was received by the Duke of \u00c9pernon, governor of Angoumois. At that time the castle was the residence of the governors.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\nDuring the French Revolution the city was called Mountagne-Charente. The first tree of liberty was planted on 5 July 1792.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\n.\nOn 24 June 1940, the 2nd Verf\u00fcgungstruppe division (special intervention troops) Das Reich supported by other units of the Wehrmacht arrived in Angoul\u00eame. These troops took prisoners and neutralized the many refugee French soldiers in the city. Their number is estimated between 10 and 20 thousand. They were released in the following days.\nThe Das Reich division, which became tragically famous in 1944 during the Battle of Normandy, continued their \"lightning war\" by quickly moving to the Spanish border to quickly set the line of demarkation to cut France in two. Angoul\u00eame was located in the occupied zone under German authority and was the seat of the Feld Kommandatur. The border with the free zone, colloquially called the zone nono (non-occupied) passed about 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of Angoul\u00eame through the Forest of Braconne and split the department in two.\nOn 20 August 1940 a convoy of Spanish Republicans were sent from Angoul\u00eame: convoy 927. This was the first convoy of the history of Deportation in Europe. Men over the age of 13 were sent to the Mauthausen camp where very few survived; women and children were sent to Franco. These refugees were gathered in camps of \"Combe aux Loups\" at Ruelle-sur-Touvre and \"Alliers\" in Angoul\u00eame. It also served as a concentration camp for Gypsies until June 1946.\nOn 21 October 1941 the young Gontran Labr\u00e9g\u00e8re, who tried with his friend Jean Pierre Rivi\u00e8re to set fire to a train carrying straw and munitions in Angoul\u00eame railway station, was shot by the occupiers. This was the first of a long list of 98 resistance fighters or hostages from Charente. In 1942 Mayor Guillon was dismissed and accused of belonging to an organisation outlawed by the Vichy regime. He was replaced by a notable industrialist, Pallas.\nOn 8 October 1942, 387 people of Jewish origin were arrested and deported to Auschwitz. Only eight of them ever returned. On 19 March 1944 allied bombing caused widespread damage and one casualty at the National Explosives factory. On 15 June and 14 August 1944, the railway station was the target of American Flying Fortresses that dumped a carpet of bombs with little damage to the Germans but killing 242 civilians, destroying 400 houses, and caused 5,000 disaster victims in l'\u00c9peron, l'Houmeau, Madeleine, and Grand-Font districts. At the end of August 1944 the Elster column, which was composed of the remains of various German units and the Indische Legion, passed through the city without incident and withdrew.\nVarious units of FFI from the department and reinforcements from Dordogne then began the encirclement of the city. On the evening of 31 August an attack was launched, putting to flight the remnants of the German garrison. They fortunately did not have an opportunity to reorganize the defence of the city using the numerous and formidable fortifications erected for this purpose. On the night of 31 August to 1 September the city was liberated and a Liberation Committee with a new prefect was installed. This attack, however, resulted in 51 casualties among the different units involved: Maquis de Bir Hacheim, Groupe Soleil, SSS (Special Section for Sabotage), etc.\nA museum in the commune is devoted to the Resistance and the deportations of Jewish and political prisoners. A statue near the station commemorates the deportations to the concentration camps. The survivors of Operation Frankton, notable for their daring raid by canoe on the German U-boat base at Bordeaux, made their escape across country to a safe house at Ruffec just north of Angoul\u00eame. This is now the site of a shop featuring British goods. The Monument to the Resistance is in Chasseneuil to the east.\n\n\n=== Postwar history ===\nAfter the war, the city underwent a major expansion of its suburbs. First Grand Font and Bel-Air, following the MRU reconstruction program for war damage of the area around the station which was bombed in 1944. Then in the 1960s the districts of Basseau (ZAC) and the Grande-Garenne were built and then there was the creation of Priority Urban Zones (ZUPs) at Ma Campagne in the 1970s.\nGradually industries moved into more spacious industrial zones created in the peripheral communes between 1959 and 1975:\nSillac-Rabion (1959)\nles Agriers (1964)\nZI No. 3: Gond-Pontouvre and L'Isle-d'Espagnac (1967)\nNersac (early 1970s)\nCombe at Saint-Yrieix (1980)Urbanisation also affected the peripheral communes with housing estates at Soyaux and Ruelle-sur-Touvre and the agglomeration became one of the largest cities in the south-west.In 1972, the city signed a \"pilot city\" contract with the State (DATAR, represented by Albin Chalandon), which allowed the city to make large scale public works - e.g. the small ring road (bridge and Rue Saint-Antoine, Boulevard Bretagne, Tunnel of G\u00e2tine) penetrating Ma Campagne and called the way to Europe, the ZUPs at Ma Campagne, the Saint-Martial town centre, underground parking at Bouillaud and Saint-Martial, Montauzier indoor swimming pools at Ma Campagne, a pedestrianized street, a one-way traffic plan with computerized management of traffic lights (Angoul\u00eame is one of the first cities in France with Bordeaux which has the Gertrude computerized system called Philibert in Angoul\u00eame), STGA urban transport (ten routes with flexible buses), development of Bouillaud square, Conservatory of Music.In 1989 after defeat in the municipal elections, the PS deputy mayor, Jean-Michel Boucheron left a hole of 164 million francs in the finances of the city and a debt of 1.2 billion francs. This deficit has burdened the finances of the city and long served as justification for the non-involvement in the completion of public works.\nThe small ring road (the southwest quarter - i.e. the Aquitaine Boulevard, a second bridge over the Charente, and the connection to the way of Europe) was completed in 1995.\nFollowing the construction of the Nautilis swimming complex at Saint-Yrieix by the urban community, the town of Angoul\u00eame closed three swimming pools in 2001 (Montauzier, Ma Campagne and the Bourgines summer pool).\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\nDevelopment of the coat of armsThe first known blazon was: Azure Sem\u00e9-de-lis of Or, a city gate with two towers of argent debruised by the whole.\nUnder Philip V in 1317: The Two Towers became three.\nUnder Charles VI in 1381 are: Azure Sem\u00e9-de-lis of Or, a bend compony of Argent and Or debruised by the whole for brisure. The door at tower three encloses an outdoor ornament.\nUnder Charles VII in 1452 the brisure changes for: a label of three points, with the middle pointed.\nIn the 16th century, the door with two towers reappears surmounted by a fleur de lys of gold.\nIn 1850 a star replaced the fleur de lys which reappeared in 1855.\nAt an unknown date the crown was added.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\nList of Successive Mayors since 1944\n(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Cantons ===\nAngoul\u00eame is divided over three cantons:\n\nAngoul\u00eame-1, which comprises the commune of Fl\u00e9ac and part of Angoul\u00eame\nAngoul\u00eame-2, which comprises the commune of L'Isle-d'Espagnac and part of Angoul\u00eame\nAngoul\u00eame-3, which comprises the commune of Soyaux and part of Angoul\u00eame\n\n\n=== Intercommunality ===\nThe Urban Community of Greater Angoul\u00eame or Grand Angoul\u00eame includes 16 communes: Angoul\u00eame, Fleac, Gond-Pontouvre, La Couronne, Linars, L'Isle-d'Espagnac, Magnac-sur-Touvre, Mornac, Nersac, Puymoyen, Ruelle-sur-Touvre, Saint-Michel, Saint-Saturnin, Saint-Yrieix-sur-Charente, Soyaux, and Touvre.\nThe population of the conurbation was 103,501 inhabitants in 2006 (102,368 in 1999).\n\n\n=== Budget and taxation ===\nTaxation is at a rate of 40.20% on buildings, 71.94% on undeveloped land, and 18.43% for the housing tax (2007 figures).\nThe urban community levies 19.20% business tax.\n\n\n=== Urban development ===\nThe Champ de Mars is the central square of the city and has had an underground shopping arcade since September 2007.\nThe eastern ring road was opened in 2004 (2010 for the final section) which opened up several districts. The deviation of the N10 which has bypassed the city since 1973 has formed a western ring road since 2004 when the initial Fl\u00e9ac-Linars project was abandoned.\nRehabilitation operations for collective housing are underway as part of the government Operation for Urban Renewal. The districts of Grande Garenne, Basseau and Ma Campagne were combined in a program of urban regeneration.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Movies and TV series shot in Angoul\u00eame ===\nBlanche and Marie by Jacques Renard with Miou-Miou and Sandrine Bonnaire, shot in Angoul\u00eame and Rouillac, released in 1985\nThe Child of the Dawn with Thierry Lhermitte filmed at Angoul\u00eame and Cognac\nSOS 18 shot in and around Angoul\u00eame\nFather and Mayor filmed in the communes of Angoul\u00eame and Magnac-sur-Touvre (in the series, Angoul\u00eame is called Ville-Grand)\nMy son anyway by Williams Cr\u00e9pin with Cl\u00e9mentine C\u00e9lari\u00e9 in 2004.\nAnd you About Love? by Lola Doillon, 2007\nMammuth by Benoit Del\u00e9pine and Gustave Kervern\nTo the four winds by Jacques Doillon\nDying of love by Jos\u00e9e Dayan, with Muriel Robin\nAt the bottom of the ladder by Arnaud Mercadier with Vincent Elbaz, Claude Brasseur, Bernadette Lafont, and Helena Noguerra\nVictoire Bonnot with Valerie Damidot and Shirley Bousquet filmed at the Saint-Paul Secondary School\nThe Lies by Fabrice Cazeneuve with Hippolyte Girardot and Marilyne Canto, filmed in Angoul\u00eame and Puymoyen, released in 2010\nCode Lyoko Evolution, filmed mid-2012 at the Lyc\u00e9e Guez de Balzac\nLe Grand Soir filmed at Angoul\u00eame and the ZAC at Montagnes by Benoit Del\u00e9pine and Gustave Kervern with Albert Dupontel and Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde 2012.\nIndiscretions by Jos\u00e9e Dayan with Muriel Robin, filmed during the summer of 2013 in Angoul\u00eame, Saint-M\u00eame-les-Carri\u00e8res and Bassac, released in November 2013.\nThe French Dispatch - Wes Anderson's 10th film was shot in the area between 2018 and 2019.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nAngoul\u00eame is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n=== Demographic classification ===\nBy population the city of Angoul\u00eame is by far the largest city in Charente with 42,242 inhabitants on 1 January 2009.\nWith a communal area of 2,185 hectares, the density of population is 1,940 inhabitants per km2, making it the most densely populated city in Charente and the third most densely populated city in Nouvelle-Aquitaine after La Rochelle and Poitiers.\nIn 2008, the Urban Unit of Angoul\u00eame, which includes eighteen communes totaled 109,553 inhabitants and its Urban Area, which includes 80 suburban communes in the impact zone of the city, totaled 174,482 inhabitants.It brings together nearly 106,000 inhabitants within an urban conurbation which extends over fifteen kilometres (9.3 miles) from north to south. Angoul\u00eame is the most populous commune in the department of Charente and is the third largest Urban Unit in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, ranking just after Poitiers and La Rochelle and ahead of Niort.\nIts Urban Area has 178,650 inhabitants and is composed of 108 communes.The different data show that Angoul\u00eame is the largest urban agglomeration in Charente.\n\n\n=== Demographic changes ===\nIn 2009 Angoul\u00eame had 42,242 inhabitants (down 2% compared to 1999). The commune was 160th in size at the national level, while it was at 145th in 1999, and 1st at the departmental level out of 404 communes.\nThe evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n=== Distribution of age groups ===\nPercentage Distribution of Age Groups in Angoul\u00eame and Charente Department in 2009\n\nSources:\n\nEvolution and Structure of the population of the Commune in 2009, INSEE.\nEvolution and Structure of the population of the Department in 2009, INSEE.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAngoul\u00eame is a centre of the paper-making and printing industry, with which the town has been connected since the 14th century. Papermaking is favoured because of the uniform temperature and volume of the water year-round, partly due to the Touvre River, which joins the Charente at Angoul\u00eame. The Touvre is the second largest river with an underground source in France after the River Sorgue (Fontaine-de-Vaucluse).\n\nThe Touvre emerges as a full-blown river from the head of the valley at Ruelle. A trout fishery is located at the source and a pumping station supplies the drinking water needs of Angoul\u00eame. Most of the paper mills are situated on the banks of watercourses in the neighbourhood of the town. Cardboard for packaging, as well as fine vellum for correspondence, have been produced in quantity.\nThe best known export is Rizla+ cigarette roll-up paper, a combination of riz (rice paper) and LaCroix, after Monsieur LaCroix the founder. Le Nil is another local brand of roll-up paper, named not after the Nile in Egypt but after a small tributary of the Charente. The Le Nil paper-mill is now the Paper Museum. Paper-making in the town has been in decline.\nThe economy of the modern town also is supplemented by annual tourist events and festivals. For example, the printers and paper-makers, whose industry relied on intricate machinery, became skilled mechanics and among the first to become fascinated with the motor car in the late 19th century. Motor trials were held regularly, starting on the long straight road through Puymoyen, now a suburb. Monsieur LaCroix (of RIZLA+) was a celebrated motorcycle racer. The Paris-Madrid road race of 1903, notorious for its cancellation due to numerous deaths, passed through Angoul\u00eame. Marcel, one of the brothers Renault, was one of the victims. The place of his death is marked by a memorial on road RN10 to Poitiers.\nThe town has been closely associated with motor trials and racing. The Circuit des Remparts (see below) is held annually, one of the last such street-racing course in France, together with Pau (and Monaco). In addition to local heroes, internationally known racing drivers, such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Jean-Pierre Wimille, Pierre Veyron and Maurice Trintignant, have been regular participants. The cars which they drove frequently are presented at the modern event. The hotel and restaurant trade receives a considerable boost from the races.Subsidiary industries, such as the manufacture of machinery, electric motors and wire fabric, are of considerable importance. Angoul\u00eame is the most inland navigable port on the Charente River. The traditional river boat is the Gabare. Iron and copper founding, brewing and tanning also continue. The manufacture of gunpowder, confectionery, heavy iron goods, gloves, boots and shoes (including the traditional pantoufle carpet slippers) and cotton goods are also important. There is wholesale and retail trade in wine, cognac and building-stone.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe new high-speed link between Tours and Bordeaux bypasses the town centre to the west, but with a link to Angoul\u00eame station from both the north and south. It opened in July 2017. Direct TGV journeys from Paris Gare Montparnasse take just over two hours. The Gare d'Angoul\u00eame railway station offers connections to Paris, Bordeaux, Tours, Limoges and several regional destinations. The main line of the Paris Bordeaux railway passes through a tunnel beneath the town and is due for large-scale refurbishment to improve travel time.\nAngoul\u00eame - Brie - Champniers Airport, newly named Angoul\u00eame-Cognac airport, is situated 9.5 km (5.9 mi) NE of the city centre in Champniers, just off the N10. The runway can accommodate the Boeing 737, and a new restaurant and shops were added in 2008. However Ryanair stopped its Angoul\u00eame-Stansted service in 2010. Air France used to operate a service to Lyon. There are currently no regular flights to/from Angoul\u00eame airport.\nLocal Buses \u2013 The city bus system is run by STGA.\n\n\n== Culture and heritage ==\n\nAngoul\u00eame and Angoumois country together are classified as a City of Art and History.\nIn place of its ancient fortifications, Angoul\u00eame is encircled by boulevards above the old city walls, known as the Remparts, from which fine views may be obtained in all directions.

        "wiki": "Aigues-Mortes (French pronunciation: \u200b[\u025b\u0261m\u0254\u0281t]; Occitan: Aigas M\u00f2rtas) is a French  commune in the Gard department in the Occitanie region of southern France.  The medieval city walls surrounding the city are well preserved. Situated on the junction of the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te and the Chenal Maritime to Grau du Roy, the town is a favoured stop for canal craft and Dutch barges.\n\n\n=== Toponymy ===\nThe name \"Aigues-Mortes\" was attested  in 1248 in the Latinized form Aquae Mortuae, which means \"dead water\", or \"stagnant water\".  The name comes from the marshes and ponds that surround the village (which has never had potable water). The inhabitants of the commune are known as Aigues-Mortais or Aigues-Mortaises.The Occitan Aigas Mortas is equivalent to toponymic types in the Morteau Oil dialect cf. Morteau (Doubs): mortua Aqua (1105, VTF521) and Morteaue (Haute-Marne): mortua Aqua (1163, VTF521). Grau du Roy in French means \"pond of the King\". In Occitan, grau means \"pond with extension\". \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe foundation of the city is said to have been by Gaius Marius, around 102BC but there is no documentary evidence to support this.\nA Roman by the name of Peccius fitted out the first salt marsh and gave his name to the Marsh of Peccais. Salt mining started from the Neolithic period and was continued in the Hellenistic period, but the ancient uses of saline have not resulted in any major archaeological discovery. It is likely that any remains were destroyed by modern saline facilities.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 791, Charlemagne erected the Mataf\u00e8re Tower amid the swamps for the safety of fishermen and salt workers. Some argue that the signaling and transmission of news was not foreign to the building of this tower which was designed to give warning in case of arrival of a fleet, as for the Magne Tower at N\u00eemes.\nThe purpose of this tower was part of the war plan and spiritual plan which Charlemagne granted at the Benedictine abbey, dedicated to Opus Dei (work of God) and whose incessant chanting, day and night, was to designate the convent as Psalmody or Psalmodi. This monastery still existed in 812, as confirmed by an act of endowment made by the Badila from N\u00eemes at the abbey.At that time, the people lived in reed huts and made their living from fishing, hunting, and salt production from several small salt marshes along the sea shore. The region was then under the rule of the monks from the Abbey of Psalmody.\nIn 1240, Louis IX, who wanted to get rid of the dependency on the Italian maritime republics for transporting troops to the Crusades, focused on the strategic position of his kingdom. At that time, Marseille belonged to his brother Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, Agde, Count of Toulouse, and Montpellier, and King of Aragon. Louis IX wanted direct access to the Mediterranean Sea. He obtained the town and the surrounding lands by exchange of properties with the monks of the abbey. Residents were exempt from the salt tax which was previously levied so that they could now take the salt unconstrained.He built a road between the marshes and built the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower to serve as a watchtower and protect access to the city. Saint-Louis then built the Constance Tower on the site of the old Mataf\u00e8re Tower, to house the garrison. In 1272, his son and successor, Philip III the Bold, ordered the continuation of the construction of walls to completely encircle the small town. The work would not be completed for another 30 years.\nThis was the city from which Louis IX twice departed for the Crusades: the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and again for the Eighth Crusade in 1270 for Tunis where he died of dysentery.\nThe year 1270 has been established, mistakenly for many historians, as the last step of a process initiated at the end of the 11th century. The judgment is hasty because the transfer of crusaders or mercenaries from the harbour of Aigues-Mortes continued after this year. The order given in 1275 to Sir Guillaume de Roussillon by Philip III the Bold and Pope Gregory X after the Council of Lyons in 1274 to reinforce Saint-Jean d'Acre in the East shows that maritime activity continued for a ninth crusade which never took place.There is a popular belief that the sea reached Aigues-Mortes in 1270. In fact, as confirmed by studies of the engineer Charles Leon Dombre, the whole of Aigues-Mortes, including the port itself, was in the Marette pond, the Canal-Viel and Grau Louis, the Canal Viel being the access channel to the sea. The Grau-Louis was approximately at the modern location of La Grande-Motte.\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, Philip the Fair used the fortified site to incarcerate the Templars. Between 8 and 11 November 1307, forty-five of them were put to the question, found guilty, and held prisoner in the Tower of Constance.\n\n\n=== Modern and contemporary periods ===\nAigues-Mortes still retained its privileges granted by the kings. Curiously it was a great Protestant in the person of Jean d'Harambure \"the One-Eyed\", light horse commander of King Henry IV and former governor of Vend\u00f4me who would be appointed governor of Aigues-Mortes and the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower on 4 September 1607. To do this, he took an oath before the Constable of France Henri de Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, who was a Catholic and supported the rival Adrien de Chanmont, the Lord of Berich\u00e8re. The conflict continued until 1612, and Harambure, supported by the pastors of Lower Languedoc and the inhabitants, finished it by a personal appeal to the Queen. He eventually resigned on 27 February 1615 in favour of his son Jean d'Harambure, but King Louis XIII restored him for six years. On 27 July 1616 he resigned again in favour of Gaspard III de Coligny, but not without obtaining a token of appreciation for the judges and consuls of the city.\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, important works were being undertaken to facilitate access to Aigues-Mortes from the sea. The old Grau-Louis, dug for the Crusades, was replaced by the Grau-de-la-Croisette and a port was dug at the base of the Tower of Constance. It lost its importance from 1481 when Provence and Marseille were attached to the kingdom of France. Only the exploitation of the Peccais salt marshes encouraged Fran\u00e7ois I, in 1532, to connect the salt industry of Aigues-Mortes to the sea. This channel, said Grau-Henry, silted up in turn. The opening, in 1752, of the Grau-du-Roi solved the problem for a while. A final solution was found in 1806 by connecting the Aigues-Mortes river port through the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFrom 1575 to 1622, Aigues-Mortes was one of the eight safe havens granted to the Protestants. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused severe repression of Protestantism, which was marked in Languedoc and the C\u00e9vennes in the early 18th century by the Camisard War. Like other towers in the town, from 1686 onwards, the Constance Tower was used as a prison for the Huguenots who refused to convert to Roman Catholicism. In 1703, Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards, managed to escape with sixteen companions.During the French Revolution, the city was called Port-Pelletier. At that time the port had almost disappeared due to silting, induced by the intensification of labour in the watershed at the same time as the clearing of woods and forests following the abolition of privileges. The decline of forest cover led to soil erosion and consequently a greater quantity of alluvial deposits in the ports of the region. Thus, in 1804 the prefect \"Mr. de Barante p\u00e8re\" wrote in a report that: \"The coasts of this department are more prone to silting ... The ports of Maguelonne and Aigues Mortes and the old port of Cette no longer exist except in history\" he alerted: \"An inordinate desire to collect and multiply these forest clearings since 1790 ... Greed has devoured in a few years the resource of the future, the mountains, opened to the plough, show that soon naked and barren rock, each groove becoming a ravine; the topsoil, driven by storms, has been brought into the rivers, and thence into the lower parts, where it serves every day to find the lowest parts and the darkest swamps.\"\n\n\n=== The massacre of Italians (August 1893) ===\n\nIn the summer of 1893, the Compagnie des Salins du Midi launched a recruiting campaign for workers for the threshing and the lifting of salt. Hiring was reduced due to the economic crisis that hit Europe, so the prospect of finding a seasonal job was attractive in this year and there were a greater number of workers looking for work. These were divided into three categories nicknamed:\n\n\"Ard\u00e8che\" peasants, not necessarily native to Ard\u00e8che, who leave their land at this time of the season;\n\"Piedmontese\" consisting of Italians from throughout northern Italy and locally recruited by team leaders: the chefs du colle;\n\"tramps\" composed mainly of vagabonds.Because of the recruitment operated by Compagnie des Salins du Midi, the chefs de colle were forced to compose teams including both French and Italians. In the early morning of 16 August 1893 a fight broke out between the two communities that quickly turned into a struggle of honour. Despite the intervention of the justice of the peace and the police, the situation rapidly degenerated. Some tramps met in Aigues-Mortes and, saying that Italians had killed some Aiguemortais, swelled the ranks of the population and of people who had not managed to find employment. A group of Italians was then attacked and tried to take refuge in a bakery that rioters wanted to burn. The prefect called for troops at 4am, but they did not arrive on the scene until 18 hours after the drama.Early in the morning, the situation escalated and the rioters moved to the Peccais saltfields where there were the largest number of Italians. Police Captain Cabley, trying to provide protection, promised the rioters to hunt the Italians and escort them to the Aigues-Mortes Police Station. It was during the journey that the Italians attacked by the rioters were massacred by a crowd that the police were unable to contain. There were seven dead and fifty wounded, some of whom had lifelong consequences. This was the largest massacre of immigrants in the modern history of France and also one of the biggest scandals in its judicial history because no condemnation was ever pronounced.\nThe case became a diplomatic issue and the transalpine (Italian) foreign press took up the cause of the Italians. There were Anti-French riots in Italy. A diplomatic solution was found and the parties were compensated while the nationalist mayor Marius Terras was forced to resign.A theatrical play by Serge Valletti called Dirty August is based on the tragic events.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAigues-Mortes is located in the Petite Camargue some 90 km (56 miles) northwest of Marseille.  By road, Aigues-Mortes is about 33 km (21 miles) southwest of N\u00eemes, and 20 km (12 miles) east of Montpellier in a direct line. Access to the commune is by route D979 coming south from Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze to Aigues-Mortes town. Route D979 continues southwest through the commune to Le Grau-du-Roi. Route D62 also starts from Aigues-Mortes heading southwest parallel to D979 before turning eastwards and forming part of the southern border of the commune. Route D62A continues to Plan d'Eau du Vidourie.\nThe commune is composed of a portion of the wet plains and lakes of the Petite Camargue. It is separated from the Gulf of Lions (and, thus, the Mediterranean) by the town of Le Grau-du-Roi, however Aigues-Mortes is connected to the sea through the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te. There is only one other hamlet in the commune called Mas de Jarras Listel on the western border.\nThe Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te enters the commune from the northwest and the northeast in two branches from the main canal to the north and the branches intersect in the town of Aigues-Mortes before exiting as a single canal alongside route D979 and feeding into the Mediterranean Sea at Le Grau-du-Roi.A rail branch line from N\u00eemes passes through Aigues-Mortes from north-east to south-west, with a station in the town of Aigues-Mortes, to its terminus on the coast at Le-Grau-du-Roi.  This line also transports sea salt.\nThe communes of Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze and Le Grau-du-Roi are adjacent to the town of Aigues-Mortes. Its inhabitants are called Aigues-Mortais or Aigues-Mortise; in Occitan they are aigamortencs.\nAigues-Mortes is one of 79 member communes of the Sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale (SCoT) of South Gard and is also one of 34 communes in the Pays Vidourle-Camargue. Aigues-Mortes is one of the four communes of the Loi littoral of SCoT in the South of Gard.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nViticulture and asparagus\nBreeding of bulls and of Camargue horses. Both are raised almost wild in the surrounding marshes.The Camargue bull is smaller than the Spanish fighting bulls, stocky, with high horns and head. It measures about 1.40 m at the withers. It is primarily intended for bullfighting which is very popular in the region.\nThe Camargue horse is the ultimate companion for herdsmen to move into the marshes and herd bulls. According to some discoveries of bones, it seems that the ancestors of the Camargue horse date to the Quaternary period. The Camargue horse is not very large, about 1.50 m tall. It has a huge resistance adapted to the terrain. Its colour is brown at birth, gradually turning white after a few years.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nProduction of salt by the operation of the saltworks of the Salins group. Probably used since ancient times, the salt of Aigues-Mortes attracted fishermen and salt workers. The Benedictine monks settled nearby in the 8th century at the Abbey of Psalmodiet to exploit this valuable commodity in the Peccais Ponds. The salt has long been one of the main resources of the city. To achieve \"table salt quality\", water pumped from the sea travels more than 70 km in \"roubines\". The concentration of sodium chloride is from 29 to more than 260 g/kilo. Mechanically harvested salt is piled up in the twinkling \"camelles\" before being packaged. It is suitable for human consumption.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe medieval heritage from the 13th and 14th centuries of the commune and its proximity to the sea attract many tourists and residents of France.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== River ===\nThe city of Aigues-Mortes is a crossroads of canals:\n\nCanal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te from the north-east and leaving westward\nCanal de Bourgidou to the southeast, and joins the Petit Rh\u00f4ne via other channels to the limit of Gard and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne\nLe Grau-du-Roi, maintained since the Middle Ages and connecting Aigues-Mortes to the central part of Grau-du-Roi\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nThe Line N\u00eemes to Le Grau-du-Roi serves the towns and villages of Costi\u00e8res and the coastline, with a terminus at Le Grau-du-Roi. It is also used for the transport of salt produced by the saltworks of the Salins Group (see link below).\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe development of seaside tourism since the 1960s was marked by the construction of new resorts (La Grande-Motte) and the extension of existing facilities from Le Grau du Roi to Port-Camargue. To facilitate access to tourists, a coastal road network has been augmented and connected to the A9 motorway. Aigues-Mortes benefits in these ways:\n\nto the east, the road D58 connects the city to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and the commune of Arles. This road winds through the rice fields and the various ponds that make up the Camargue.\nto the west, the road D62 was enlarged for cars to make a quick connection to Montpellier\nto the north, the road D979 directly connects the town to the motorway at Gallargues-le-MontueuxThe bus 106 also connects Montpellier and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Municipal Administration ===\nThe municipal council consists of 29 members including the mayor, 8 deputies, and 20 municipal councilors.\nSince the last municipal elections, its composition is as follows:\n\nList of Successive Mayors of Aigues-Mortes\n\nMayors from 1944(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe town is the capital of the canton of the same name whose general counsel is Leopold Rosso, deputy mayor of Le Grau-du-Roi and president of the Community of Communes Terre de Camargue (UMP). The canton is part of the arrondissement of N\u00eemes and the second electoral district of Gard where the member is Gilbert Collard (FN ).\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Distribution of age groups ===\nThe distribution of the population of the municipality by age group is as follows:\n\n47.6% of men (0\u201314 years = 17.7%, 15\u201329 years = 17.1%, 30\u201344 years = 22%, 45 to 59 years = 21.1% over 60 years = 22%)\n52.4% of women (0\u201319 years = 16.9%, 15\u201329 years = 15.1%, 30\u201344 years = 23.5%, 45\u201359 years = 19.9%, more than 60 years = 24.5%)The female population is over-represented compared to men. The rate of (52.4%) is substantially the same as the national rate (51.8%).\nPercentage Distribution of Age Groups in Aigues-Mortes and Gard Department in 2007\n\n\n== Local Culture ==\n\n\n=== The Aigues-Mortes Fougasse ===\nFougasse was one of the first pastries which could rise. It can be sweet (sometimes called \"tarte au sucre\" or sugar tart) or salty (with or without gratillons).\nTraditionally, making sweet fougasse in Aigues-Mortes was reserved for the Christmas period, as part of the Thirteen desserts. Based on a brioche dough, sugar, butter, and orange blossom, it was made by the baker with ingredients provided by the client. Now Aigues-Mortes fougasse sells all year.\n\n\n=== Lou Drap\u00e9 ===\nLou Drap\u00e9 is an imaginary horse mentioned in local folklore, which was supposed to walk at night around the ramparts of the city and take 50 to 100 children on his back, and disappear to \"nowhere\".\n\n\n== Historical sites ==\nAigues-Mortes has a very large number of sites registered as historical monuments.\n\n\n=== The Tower of Constance and the ramparts ===\n\nThe Tower of Constance was built in 1242 by Saint-Louis on the former site of the Mataf\u00e8re Tower which was built by Charlemagne around 790AD to house the king's garrison. The construction was completed in 1254.\nIt is 22 metres in diameter with a height of either 33 or 40 metres depending on the source. The thickness of the walls at the base is 6 metres.\nOn the ground floor, there is a guardroom protected by a portcullis. In the middle of the room, there is a circular opening leading to the cellar which served as a pantry, storage of ammunition as well as for dungeons. These areas were called the \"culs de basse fosse\", an old way of saying underground dungeons in French.\nOn the first floor, there is the knight's hall. Structurally it is similar to the guardroom. It was in this room that the Protestants were imprisoned during the 18th century, most notably Marie Durand, who engraved the word \"r\u00e9sister\" (English: resist) into the edge of the well which can be seen to this day. She was imprisoned at the age of 15, and was freed 38 years later, along with political prisoners such as Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards.\nBetween these two rooms, a narrow, covered way was built within the walls to keep watch on the room below.\nAfter the knight's hall, there is an entrance to the terrace which offers a wide panoramic view of the region, making it an ideal position for surveillance.  Sometimes, the prisoners were allowed to go on the terrace to get some fresh air.\nThe ramparts stretch for a distance of 1650 metres.\nSpectacular in their height and their state of preservation even though they were not restored in the 19th century, as was Carcassonne for example, they remain in a well preserved state. Along with the Tower of Constance, they are a testimony to Western European military architecture in the marshlands during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Carbonni\u00e8re Tower ===\n\nLocated in the commune of Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze, the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower was first referred to in an old text from 1346 specifying the function of the structure. It said, \"this fortress is the key to the kingdom in this region.\" Surrounded by salt marshes, the fortress was the only passageway into Aigues-Mortes. It was guarded by a garrison made up of a ch\u00e2telain and several guards. From the terrace, which could support up to four cannons, there is a panoramic view of Petite Camargue.\n\n\n=== The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons ===\nThe Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons is a Gothic-style church and was probably built before the ramparts in the mid-13th century during the time of Saint-Louis. In 1537 it served as a Collegiate church but was later vandalized by Protestants in 1575. After the reconstruction of the bell tower in 1634 it later served as a Temple of Reason during the French Revolution, a barracks, grain merchant, and a salt warehouse. It was re-established as a place of worship in 1804 and the building was restored in the neo classical-baroque style. Between 1964 and 1967 all of the 19th century decor was removed, notably the coffered ceilings, resulting in the much more basic and medieval style church we see today. Since 1991, the stained-glass windows by Claude Viallat, a contemporary artist belonging to the \"Supports/Surfaces\" art movement, add extraordinary light and colour to the building.  With the exception of a few statues, the rest of the 18th and 19th century furniture disappeared during this period. The fa\u00e7ade is crowned by a simple bell-gable housing 3 bells. The largest of the three is 1.07 metres in diameter. It was dated to 1740, cast by master smelter Jean Poutingon, and has been designated a historical monument of France. The church also houses a statue of Saint-Louis.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Chapel of the Gray Penitents ===\nThe Chapel of the Gray Penitents is located to the east of the Place de la Viguerie. It is the property of the Brotherhood of Grey Penitents established in 1400. The facade is in the style of Louis XIV. The entrance door is from the 17th century and is decorated with a wooden statue. The altarpiece was carved in 1687 by Sabatier.\nInside, an altarpiece represents the passion of Christ. It was built of gray stucco plaster in 1687 by the sculptor Sabatier from Montpellier. This altar, on which are the arms of the brotherhood, occupies the back of the choir.\n\n\n=== The Chapel of the White Penitents ===\nThe Chapel of the White Penitents is located at the corner of the Rue de la R\u00e9publique and Rue Louis Blanc.

Around the high altar, a painting on canvas traces the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It is attributed to Xavier Sigalon a painter born in Uz\u00e8s in 1778 . On each side of the choir stand two statues: on the left Saint Felix for the redemption of captives, on the right James, son of Alphaeus, first Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\n\n=== Saint-Louis Square ===\n\nThis is the touristic heart of the city. In the centre, opposite the main entrance of the Porte de la Gardette, stands the statue of Saint-Louis, the work of James Pradier in 1849.\n\n\n=== Plan des Theatres ===\nThe Plan des Theatres are arenas for the Camargue bullfights. They were listed in 1993 on the inventory of the list of Historic Monuments (MH) for their ethnological and cultural interest.

        "wiki": "Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert (Occitan: Sant Guilh\u00e8m dau Des\u00e8rt) is a commune in the H\u00e9rault department in the Occitanie region in southern France.  Situated in the narrow valley of the Gellone river where it meets the steep-sided gorge of the H\u00e9rault River, Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert is essentially a medieval village located on the Chemin de St-Jacques (Way of St. James) pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostella.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe area of the municipality of Saint-Guilhem is nearly 40km\u00b2 in area. \nThe town is serviced by two departmental roads D122 and D4. and the nearest towns are Ganges, a city near the source of the H\u00e9rault, about 35 km away, Montpellier also 35 km away, Gignac 15 km away, Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Sangonis 12 km away and Lod\u00e8ve (via A 75, Gignac and Aniane) 35 km distant.\nThe town, which has retained a medieval appearance, is located on the borders of the Massif Central, in the middle valley of the H\u00e9rault, north of the department of the same name. The territory of the town lies in an intramontane zone formed by the extension of the S\u00e9ranne mountain and the Cellette mountain a few kilometers from the Garrigues of the plain of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nIt is watered by the H\u00e9rault and Verdus Rivers.\nThe H\u00e9rault River, the  Combe des Arboussets and the Poujols are the main rivers that water the town.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe village has maintained its historic state. Because of its isolation, in 806 Saint Guilhem established the monastery of Gellone here.\nIn 804, the count of Toulouse and duke of Aquitaine Guilh\u00e8m in langue d 'oc (saint Guillaume) founded at a time when the valley was virtualaly uninhabited hence considered \"desert\". The abbey was originally called The Abbey of Gellone, until after Guillaume died  in 812 when it was named The Abbey of Guillaume, and then the Abbey of Saint-Guilhem after his canonization in 1066.\nThe Abbey of Aniane, nearby, was founded around 782 by a relative of Guillaume.\nThe abbey became a very important pilgrimage site in the middle ages due to a relic of a piece of the true cross was housed here. The town developed around the abbey.\nIn the Middle Ages, the abbey fell within the territory of the diocese of Lodeve.\nDuring the French Revolution, the town temporarily bore the name of Verdus-le-D\u00e9sert.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nThe parish church is the former abbey church of the abbey of Gellone where we find the best preserved French organ of Jean-Pierre Cavaill\u00e9.\nThe cloister of the abbey. A large part of this cloister was sold and dismantelled during the French Revolution and exported to the United States,  where some of it is in the New York Cloister Museum.\nThe town is on the  roads of Santiago de Compostela.\nThe Abbey Museum was the dining room of the monks, is presented the collection of sculptures of the cloister, the sarcophagi of St. Guilhem and his sisters.\nThe tower of the prisons and the castle of the Giant, elements of fortification and defense of the borough.\nThe cave of Clamouse, \"one of the most beautiful caves in France.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nIn summer, the abbey of Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert and the chapel of the Penitents are the venues for concerts, especially those of the Rencontres Musicales of Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert, those of the Friends of Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert. Guilhem and the Camerata Mediterranea.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nSaint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert is one of the Plus Beaux Villages de France (\"The most beautiful villages of France\"), and the Abbey of Gellone, along with the nearby Pont du Diable were designated UNESCO World Heritages sites in 1999.A part of the cloister of the monastery was moved to The Cloisters museum in New York City.  A new sculpture museum,  containing stone works from the abbey, was dedicated on June 26, 2009. In coordination with this event, a weekend of music and a colloquium was organized in large part by the Camerata Mediterranea.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nINSEE\nOfficial site (French)\nCamerata Mediterranea and June, 2009 colloquium",

        "wiki": "Ambrussum  is a Roman archaeological site in Villetelle, H\u00e9rault d\u00e9partement, in southern France.\nIt is close to the modern town Lunel, between N\u00eemes and Montpellier. Ambrussum is notable for its museum, its staging post on the Via Domitia, its bridge Pont Ambroix over the Vidourle, painted by Gustave Courbet, and for its oppidum (fortified village). Its history of settlement spanned 400 years.\nThe whole site is still being excavated. A lower settlement prone to flooding was a staging post for travellers on the Via Domitia and provided stabling and accommodation and the full range of repair facilities that were needed by carts and the Imperial postal service. The higher settlement was based on a pre-Roman oppidum which was within a surrounding wall including 21 towers. The Romans re-modelled the oppidum, so there is evidence of a complete range of housing styles from the earliest one room dwellings to sophisticated courtyard houses on the second century AD.\nThe Roman road, the Via Domitia, ran at the foot of the settlement, leading from it is a paved road with visible with traces of Roman chariot tracks. The Roman bridge was used until the Middle Ages but fell into disrepair, and only one complete arch remains.\n\n\n== Location ==\nAmbrussum, or its alternative spelling of Ambrusium, is mentioned as a staging post (mutatio) on the Antonine Itinerary of AD 200, on pilgrims' guide on the route to the Holy Land of AD 333 and on the Peutinger map of 1520. All place it midway between Nimes (Nemausis) and Castelnau-le-Lez (Sextantio), about 22 kilometres (14 mi) from each.\nThe Via Domitia linked the Alps with the Pyrenees, and is the oldest Roman Road in Gaul, more specifically Gallia Narbonensis in France. Laid out by Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus around 120 BC, it was to become part of the roads that linked Italy with Cadiz in Spain. At Ambussum the Via Domitia crosses the Vidourle, and the settlement provided a staging post on this road. Directly adjacent to the site, the modern A9 autoroute, the Languedocienne crosses the Vidourle and at this point there is the modern day equivalent of a mutatio, the Aire de service de Lunel. The site is reached through the village of Villetelle.\nThe bridge is 20 m above sea level, and the highest point of the oppidum is 58 m. When in spate the Vidourle will rise by 8 m. From the highest point, the Oppidum de Nages is easily seen. Further one can see Mont Ventoux, Pic Saint-Loup, and the hills of the Cevennes including the Causse du Larzac and Mont Aigoual.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site was first settled in 2,300 BC and the construction started on the oppidum around 300 BC. It was a settlement of Gauls. The Romans conquered the area in 120 BC. The paved road at the heart of the oppidum was laid around 100 BC. Between the oppidum and the river was a staging post (mutatio) on the Via Domitia. That, and the Pont Ambroix were constructed in around 30 BC. The flow patterns of the river changed around 10 BC; it became more aggressive and flooding became more frequent. The large houses on the south of the oppidum were built in AD 50. The whole oppidum was abandoned in AD 100, but parts of the lower settlement were still in use in AD 400, and the Pont Ambroix continued in use throughout the Middle Ages. It took a battering from the Vidourlades, or violent floods or spates on the Vidourle. During a spate, the water flow increases from a minimum of 3 m3/s to over 3000 m3/s. Floods were recorded on 8 October 1723. The floods of 18 November 1745 reduced the bridge from four arches to three. Further major floods occurred on 6 October 1812, 21 October 1891, and 21 September 1907. The floods of 7 September 1933 reduced the bridge from two arches to the one we see today. The site was abandoned when transit patterns changed, the Domitia became less important and the community relocated to Lunel-Viel, which better served a north\u2013south transit. The site was returned to its natural state, and later to the cultivation of vines and olives. This protected the archaeological record.\n\n\n== Site ==\nAmbrussum contains three archaeological sites of international importance: the Colline de Dev\u00e8s which was first occupied in 2300 BC and settled as an oppidum between 300 BC and 100 AD; the Roman staging post on the Via Dolmitia which had hotels, a baths and industrial buildings; the Roman bridge, the Pont Ambroix.\nThe bridge is a M\u00e9rim\u00e9e list National Monument No. PA00103057. The oppidum is a M\u00e9rim\u00e9e list National Monument No. PA00103760 \n\n\n=== Oppidum ===\n \nOriginally the Oppidum was the work of the Volcae Arecomici who started it in the fourth century BC. Nine square houses from the earliest period were recorded by \u00c9mile Marignan, these were roofed with branches and reeds. A rectangular house from the third century has been excavated. This contained both rough earthenware pottery for cooking and a finer black glazed table ware. During the first century BC, the hill was terraced and the houses became narrower similar to those found at Nages.\nThe hill was fortified in the late fourth century BC, the ramparts enclosed an area of 5.6 hectares (14 acres). It was triangular in form but most of the eastern section was looted to be used in lime kilns. It consisted of a 7.5-metre (25 ft) dry limestone wall. There were three gateways, one to the north, south and east. The 635-metre (694 yd) western section of the wall, cleared in 1974, revealed 24 bastions. These were originally rectangular but were replaced in the mid-third century BC with rounded ones. Two of the towers were substantially higher; these were built as watch towers and for prestige. The ramparts were abandoned in the first century AD.After the Romans settled the area in 120 BC the hill was redeveloped, the residential areas were reorganised, and the road through the settlement from the east gate to the south gate was paved. The south gate was enlarged and a large square was cleared behind with a civil basilica, stones of which made their way in the second century AD to the staging post. The Via Dolmitia would have passed around the hill, but it has been speculated that it passed along this narrow road. The route of the Via often passes along roads with the name 'Route de la Monnaie', but as this originates from a translation of 'raised road' it merely shows that the road was using Roman construction techniques rather than that it formed part of the Via Dolmitia. The south gate does lead to a 'Route de la Monnaie', but the paved road in the oppidum has a gradient of 9% and is too narrow for carts to pass, although it would have been suitable for important visitors. The paved road at the east gate leads towards the bridge, but stops abruptly at a steep bank. It is thought that the river has undercut the bank at this point and removed all traces of the road.The north of the post-conquest oppidum is densely populated, but the houses there were of the domus style found throughout the Empire - courtyard dwellings where the slaves lived closest to the entrance and the family in the building opposite. To the south are some large 400-square-metre (4,300 sq ft) courtyard homes built around AD 50.The whole oppidum was abandoned in AD 100.\n\n\n=== Staging post ===\n\nThe existence of a staging post for the Imperial mail is known of from written sources, and also that it was located by the Vidourle and as a consequence was continually being rebuilt. An embankment was built to protect the settlement from flooding. The Imperial staging post itself was a complex containing two courtyards and two buildings. In the south gallery, the walls were decorated with paintings and a purse containing 43 denarii has also been found there. This building would have been for Imperial messengers and travelling officials. It was renovated and possibly changed its use in the fourth century AD, at a time when the rest of the site had been abandoned. \nA separate inn has been excavated. It contained a courtyard for the animals and carts and five guest rooms. Adjacent was a building with a bread oven. The inn remained substantially unchanged from 30 BC to AD 125. Nearby, and closer to the water were two further inns, parts of which date from AD 200 to 250. The settlement was substantial enough to have a bathhouse. Although most of it is now beneath a modern road, the heater chamber remains. The praefurnia took the heated air to the underfloor heating, hot water to the calidarium and steam to the laconicum. There was also a blacksmith's courtyard house with a forge specialising in carriage building. This dates from AD 25 to 175.  Excavations are still continuing; the land is privately owned and not accessible to the public.\n\n\n=== Pont Ambroix ===\n\nThe bridge was built across the Vidourle River with 11 arches. It was still usable in the Middle Ages, with all 11 arches intact, but a sketch by Anne Rulman in 1620 shows only four and then when painted by Gustave Courbet in 1857 only two arches were left. One of those was lost in the flooding of 1933, so only a single arch remains.\n\n\n== Excavation ==\n\nThe antiquity of the Pont Ambroix had never been disputed and it had been visited by M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, who included it in the first edition of his Historical Monuments of France in 1840. The adjacent hill, the Colline de Dev\u00e8s, was not investigated until the 1960s however. In 1964 Marc Fenouillet did a surface inspection in the vineyard at the base of the hill and found Roman era remains. In November 1967, the first archaeological test digging was begun on the hill itself by Jean-Luc Fiches and traces of the oppidum were found; a larger, volunteer dig was made the following July. In 1974, a path had been cleared around the ramparts and the oppidum was recognised and classified as an historic monument. A regular pattern of annual digs was established. The paved road was discovered in 1975. Between 1980 and 1985 further excavations established that the lower site, adjacent to the bridge, was a staging post on the Via Domitia. In 1984 the hill was donated to authorities in Lunel but the lower site remains in private ownership. There was a pause in the excavations between 1986 and 1992. Subsequently, the lower site became the focus of attention, along with the contours of the river. In 2009 the community of Lunel began the construction of a visitor centre and museum, although work was interrupted in May 2011 by an accidental fire that set the vegetation alight. Four water-carrying aircraft Canadairs were called in to help the firefighters sapeur-pompiers extinguish the fire. Fortuitously, the fire revealed more features of the oppidum. The museum designed by Michel Goroneskoul opened on 25 June 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOppidum de Nages\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite about Ambrussum (in French)\nWebpage about Ambrussum (in French)\nPainting by Gustave Courbet\nA short Tour of Ambrussum",

          "The Pont du Gard is an incredible multi level bridge built by the Romans. Vehicles can still cross it but permission is limited. We were thrilled to see the Tour de France cross it one day and start at it the next! In the shadows of the bridge the river is deep and the beach is",

          "When we arrived, the rain was so heavy we decided to tour the museum. It was great and we spent quite a bit of time checking all the exhibits. Very informative. Th3 rain was worse when we finished our tour of the museum so we missed the aqueduct.",
          "We were so excited to visit this place on our trip. It does not disappoint. I don't mind the fee or the walk. It's got parking and bathroom which should be bathrooms. We enjoyed this place for about an hour or so and had a great time doing it. I only wish I had brought my swim",

          "When you stand back and think about it, the construction of this aqueduct bridge was an amazing fear of Roman engineering. Built in the first century AD to carry water over 50 km to the Roman colony at N\u00eemes, it crossed the Gardon River near the town of Vers-Pont-du-Gard and",
          "Probably the number 1 must see in Provence. It certainly helped that the day we travelled to Pont du Gard was gorgeous - unbelievable bright clear blue sky. The drive from St Remy where we were staying is incredibly beautiful. The lower Luberon is so pretty and much less busy",

          "It was hard to imagine the ingenuity of the construction of this famous aquaduct. It was a perfect day for some spectacular pictures. Not overly crowded. It is a very easy walking trail to the actual site. There is a great museum and movie offered. Areas to eat and snack",
          "This was a stop on a full day tour. We spent a little time in the museum before walking up a slight paved incline leading to the three tiered aqueduct. There is a restaurant and and ice cream shop on the the way. This reminder of Roman times and ingenuity is awesome as you see",

          "That this aqueduct was built 2000 years ago just to carry water from Uzes to Nimes beggars belief. It appears in excellent condition, and sits beautifully in the ever gorge. There is a substantial, modern, ticket, shop cafe and museum building well out of sight of the",

          "The bridge itself is also a wonderful site. Saw it a few yea ago in the daytime and thought it was worth a detour while traveling in the So of France. This time we made our plans around the timing of the light show. Several times/ yr ( check the website) in the dark sky.",
          "As an architecture buff, I have always been impressed by what the Romans constructed centuries ago. But this Roman bridge over the Gardon River in the South of France truly has a major wow factor that stopped me in my tracks. I had been ambling along a walking trail from the",
          "Well worth the time to visit and walk the whole site. If you have more time, you can swim in the river and make a day of it. The Roman construction is amazing!",
          "It's just as glorious as the pictures make it out, and although you can't walk on the aqueduct, there's hiking trails and views up in the hills around it, as well as a museum. It seemed pretty crowded when I was there, and it wasn't even high tourist season. There's an",
          "We stopped here from our way from Montpellier to Marseilles. The place is beautiful. Entrance is not for free.",
          "The viaduct itself is impressive - from an engineering perspective as well as aesthetically. The river is good for swimming, its banks the perfect place for a great stroll and to \u2018chill\u2019. Cafe style facilities available.",
          "You don't have to be a history or architecture buff to enjoy this. We were blown away by the scale and grandeur of Pont Du Gard. Even better to see families picnicking and swimming around the site. Fantastic. Worth a walk up to the high ground and view the aqueduct from elevated",
          "What do you say about the Pont du Gard? Obviously it is one of the great wonders of the world. The museum is helpful as well, so that you more fully appreciate why this architectural feat is so remarkable. We visited on a lovely afternoon, so we enjoyed a shady amble across",
          "We found Pont du Gard on the internet while traveling in France. We decided to fit in a visit and were so glad we did! This is an amazing sight to see. We went on the right side of the river and quickly discovered the better view was from the left so we walked across the",
          "This had long been on my list of places to visit and it did not disappoint! It is a spectacular example of Roman engineering. We parked on the side opposite the museum which meant we got to see the aqueduct up close as soon as we arrived. You see it from the river as you",
          "With the full tour, we were able to walk through the water channel. It's one thing to read or hear how much mineral deposited on the side, it's quite different to see it up close and touch it. I had very high expectations for this bridge/aqueduct, and I was blown away with the",
          "impressive change since last time I visited 20 yrs ago when none of the visitor centre, restaurant, etc stuff existed. This is a 1 hr visit max but worth it as one of the two most impressive aqueducts in The non-Italian former Roman Empire (Segovia in central Spain the other",

          "The last time I'd been was almost 35 years ago, when I visited this same place with my parents and siblings. A lot has changed since, there's no more vehicle traffic across the aqueduct and it's now classed a World Heritage Site by Unesco, but I was happy to see the magnificent",
          "This Roman Aqueduct in its stunning location over a deep gorge was to be one of the highlights of our sketching holiday. Our picnic on the banks of the Gard was idyllic and we settled down to draw in some shade. Sadly they are drilling with some heavy machinery on the riverbank",
          "We headed to Pont du Gard without doing an research, and thinking it would be a bit of some ruins of the Aquaduct. Take some selfies, get back in the car. But no. First, you need to enter the \"grounds\" to see the structure at all. There are parking lots and entrances on",
          "The Romans built a water line to provide the city of nimes with water. The biggest structure in the line is the aquaduct of pont du gard. Built in only 5 years the structure really is a marvel. !!!!",

          "Impressive roman aqueduct. So big, especially when you think that it was build 2000 years ago. Although it's 2000 years old, it is in very good condition. Nice area around - there's a river, green area, even a forest. You could have a picnic and relax a few hours, even an entire",
          "You will be aw-struck as you come around the corner and suddenly see this amazing sight. My husband and I had been before, but this time brought out daughter and Grandsons (9 and 7 yrs). My daughter was a bit concerned that the boys would not be interested in seeing an old",
          "Great monument in a well Maintained park. If you want to walk the 2nd and 3rd level of the aqueduct, make sure you book online way in advance. They have only organized tour for 35 people per day. Unfortunately we were too late for that. Go to rive gauche to start as it",
          "Set aside at least 2 - 3 hours to enjoy this magnificent Roman site. We didn't realise that only a certain number of tickets are available to view the Pont du Gard at close quarters but it didn't matter as the grounds are so big and beautiful. Take a picnic lunch and make a day",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Pont du Gard. There is an informative museum prior to visiting the bridge which was quite good. It explains how the bridge was built and how it influenced the town of Nimes. This is a wonderfully preserved Roman bridge which was part of a 30",
          "While it took a while to actually get to the bridge, it was certainly worth it. Having visited in early April on a Sunday afternoon, if you want to obtain access to the 3rd level, buy your tickets in advance so you are not disappointed. It seems that they limit the number of",
          "After kayaking under the aqueduct, we drove over to see the musuem. Excellent and interactive. This site explained what we had just paddled under and the path up and around the monument is very doable and enjoyable. A must-see on any trip to Provence.",

          "I visited from Australia and, wow, what a wonderful piece of Roman engineering. Access is easy, the view is amazing and museum explains how the Romans got those great stone bricks so far up in the air. The aqueduct itself is an imposing and amazing piece of work.",
          "We went out of our way to visit this amazing site, not knowing what to expect. And there it was in all its magnificence. Nothing phone - no extra adornment -- just a silent sentinel magnificent bridging a valley as it has for thousands of years, a tribute to our distant past and",

          "Our first of many visits to the area was over 30 years ago, the first to the actual bridge was with local friends we were visiting in April many years ago and we fell in love with it. To see its sheer scale and realize that it was started just BC and took 60-80 years to complete",
          "While many of our bridges are in need of repair and some fall down, this ancient Roman aqueduct built in the first century AD still stands. Sure, it could use repairing, too, but it may have been in use as late as the 6th century. They built things to last back then. Seriously,",
          "so glad we went here and spent several hours on the beach, in the water (my tween boys and husband were jumping off rocks and swimming) and hiking the bridge. It was packed (this was last July) but still very glad we went. Amazing structure!",
          "Fantastic monument. So interesting, so much history. Good shops, museum, caf\u00e9s, a lovely view of the river under the bridge, don't miss this if you're in the region.",
          "Around 2000 years old and still impressive. What must this have been like when first built? If in the area a visit to the Pont du Gard is a must. Built by the Romans, this aqueduct remains a great piece of architecture. You can walk around and under it to get some great",

          "We drove specifically to visit this place from Avignon. The aqueduct gives you a sense of history and scale. It is immense and tallest one still in existence and ever built in this area. Whether you start on the la rive droite (right side) or la rive gauche (left side) be sure",
          "This is a stunning sight. One of the best in all of France. It\u2019s remarkably well preserved and has a real sense of peace about it. For those of you travelling on local transport there are easy bus connections from Nimes and Ales. The Edgard bus company has an office right",
          "The acqueduct of Pont du Gard is one of the most well preserved roman aqueduct tracts in the world. The location is wonderful and families can anjoy a lot of walks on the hills around the monument or just relax on the beaches along the river",
          "The Romans built some amazing things and this is one of them. The entrances are easy to find. We were able to walk from one side to the other so it really doesn't matter on which side you park. The museum is okay. But the aquaduct itself is just extraordinary to see. The",
          "The high point of our south of France trip. The tour guide spent way too long in misguiding us through the museum, and we really would have preferred to do it on our own. But it was a beautiful day for a walk, and the aqueduct exceeded my expectations. Over and over I had to",
          "A well preserved Roman aqueduct with a fantastic museum explaining how it was made and how it functioned throught the history of N\u00eemes. If you're into roman history, architecture, or ancient ruins, it is well worth the visit.",
          "In high season, there is huge tourist interest and pressure here in addition, at weekends, to the river being used as an impromptu water park too! The addition of the visitors centre a few years ago has certainly improved the facilities greatly, but the cost to visit has also",
          "Extremely well-kept Roman aqueduct. Below it there is a large beach. Definitely worth the visit. It's about half an hour by car from Nimes.",
          "When you see photos of France, this is one of the ionic landmarks that is included. I decided to switch our optional excursion from Chateauneuf-du-Pape to visiting the Pont du Gard Aqueduct instead. Boy am I glad that I did that. Close to Avignon, we traveled along the",
          "Went as a half-day trip from Avignon, thinking it would just be a park with some ruins... was very pleasantly surprised by a very well-thought-out and educational museum, which detailed the roman lifestyle and its dependence on water, through the construction of the aqueduct and",
          "Really cool to visit, take a picnic, and go for a swim. Came with friends during the weekend, it is pretty crowded with lots of people around the river when it's hot. We sat directly under the aqueduct and took turns swimming in the river and jumping off the rocks. I also took",
          "I had rented a car and was heading to the coast from Carcassonne. I wanted to see where the small roads would take me and found myself in a town that had a tourist office. Armed with a guide of the region and seeing the aqua duct listed, I chose it as my destination. Even in the",
          "It is a good idea to stop at the museum before taking the trail leading to the Gardon River and the Pont du Gard aqueduct. In the museum you will see models and multi media presentations explaining the ancient Roman engineering project to bring water from miles away to this",
          "This has long been on my bucket list, in fact, since my university days when I listened to my art history professor talk about a Roman engineering and architectural achievement in the south of France and watched his slides of this ancient aqueduct. We took a day tour from",
          "The bridge/aqueduct is an impressive architectural marvel considering it was 2000 years ago. There is a bus that can get you there from Nimes, then it\u2019s a short walk. Worth it! The short film is user friendly and gives a little info on the history. I recommend the trip.",
          "Visited with husband and teen daughter in August. Extremely hot and busy. Entered car park to find out what the entry fee to see Pont du Gard was - did not have the entire day to spend there, just a couple of hours. The cost was astronomical for three of us so we decided not to",
          "It's pity that such a beautiful place is kept by dull people who obstruct the street to the bridge. There is a planned free bike path that they have made it impassable to force you to pay their ticket for a public monument. The bike path has become a forest, here after few",
          "Dear people of Pont du Gard, We\u2019ve been travelling through France for quite some time now. We\u2019ve seen so many monuments that I lost count. For the last day in France, I just wanted to have a stroll past the Pont du Gard, I never had any intention of actually visiting and",
          "We had wanted to see this attraction for ages but you can see everything by buying the general ticket and trust us, the view is much better from the beach than on the bridge itself. The museum and film are also highly missable since the curation is pretty poor and not hugely",
          "The Pont-du-Gard is a superb site - not to be missed. You are looking at a Roman aqueduct nearly 2000 years old and in a superb state (albeit restored over the years). The location, between rocks and over a lovely river, is glorious. So what's not to like? The company",
          "Well preserved Monument close to Arles and N\u00eemes. Some walking needed but no difficult paths unless you decide to visit the guided tour to different floors of the monument. Overpriced shop and cafes/restaurant but entry fee worth the price. Parking fee included in entry ticket.",
          "It's a shame to have to pay to get inside the place but at least the ticket (8,50\u20ac minimum) covers the parking. The bridge is really impressive. The museum gives a lot of details about the Romain's way of life in Southern France and many informations about their buildings",
          "200 years ago the world's tallest roman bridge was built in only 5 years. It is a remarkable spectacle and it was great to visit on a fine autumnal day when there were relatively few people there. We parked on the right bank (the less popular) and walked across to the other side",
          "We are so glad we took the time to visit this out of the way attraction. It is well worth your time!! It is absolutely spectacular. Just an FYI if you do take the bus from Nimes. We missed the last one because we stood in the wrong spot for the bus pick-up. The drop off spot is",
          "There are left and right bank car parks, and it appeared that the greater range of facilities are on the right - but it is easy to walk across the lower bridge adjacent to the Pond du Gard. Parking is \u20ac8, but this is deducted from your ticket to the site - we opted for the",
          "This is a must see. My husband and I are still in awe of this Roman aquaduct. It\u2019s very impressive. This is on the top 5 things we have seen in all our travels.",
          "This is a must do when visiting N\u00eemes. We caught a bus from N\u00eemes train station and were dropped off about 5 mins walk from the entrance for Pont du Gard. We bought our tickets and proceeded to the museum and to watched a short film (which didn\u2019t actually give any real history",
          "Photos cannot provide an understanding of this massive accomplishment. You need to take the guided tour and actually walk through the water channel at the top of the structure. We arrived late in the day and only had a hour there but wish we had more time to explore.",
          "The Romans did an amazing job in Building this aqueduct.You can walk on the bridge and there is an excellent audio visual centre.",
          "We thought that this would be a quick stop, see the bridge, take a picture and move on. How wrong we were! We took time to visit the museum before walking to the bridge. What a worthwhile and informative visit. It was incredible to see the \"advanced\" technology that was used",
          "We were fortunate to travel in mid-October with summer-like weather and off season \"crowd\" levels. We read that this location was a \"tourist trap\" but we could not disagree more. The entire grounds are large, well maintained and well presented. You can walk endless trails,",
          "The man from whom we rented our airbnb said not to bother. \"It's only a bridge.\" We are so very glad we went anyway. We could have spent an entire day here as it's been beautifully designed for tourists--large parking lots, good signage, a spacious restaurant with restrooms,",
          "A spectacular accomplishment of the Eoman period.Great views down to the river.You can walk on the bridge too.Museum and excellent audio show.",
          "We took a canoe trip, I think 8 km long. A view of huge aqueduct from Roman period from the river below is magnificent. You can pull up short and feast your eyes on art of ancient builders.",
          "We take a bus then walk about 10 minutes arrived there. It is a wonderful bridge keeping well. But it can not walk across the bridge.",
          "This is truly an amazing sight. This aqueduct was built 2,000 years ago; and it is still standing. The engineering involved is astounding. Yes, it has deteriorated into nothing like it was back when Jesus Christ was walking around in Israel, but most of the 'damage' was",
          "Well worth the 8.50 euro parking plus 17 euro admittance for two. Unable to take the tour as had the dog who was not allowed. Nice walks around the site which was enjoyed by the dog. Nice restaurant beside the river.",
          "On a pleasant day, you can take your time to fully appreciate this incredible structure. The pedestrian bridge gives you a close up view. Moreover, the museum is loaded with fascinating exhibits presented in a modern entertaining fashion. There is a short film as well. Don't",
          "WOW! The second largest Roman structure in Europe. It is massive and VERY impressive. Be sure to buy a premium ticket (with guide) so you can walk the actual aqueduct at the very top (the standard ticket only allows you to walk across the foot bridge lower on the structure).",
          "The Pont du Gard is an amazing aqueduct but even more impressive if you chose to watch it passing under in a canoe - highly recommendable",
          "This fantastic Roman aquaduct is a must to visit, the aquaduct is huge not only built to carry water it was also built to alow easy level acess for the Romans and all since to cross this wide gorge and fast flowing river. On arrival buy your ticket which will cover your parking",
          "How things have changed since my last visit 30 years ago! Pont du Gard is the same but the surrounding area has been developed beyond recognition. Despite this it still a 'must see' site and the introduction of cafes and toilets is a definite plus.",
          "One walks around a bend from the parking lot and--POW!--there it is, truly one of the masterpieces of man-made wonder. Even now, 2,000 years after having been built, it inspires awe. Be sure to see the video and visit the museum, for they provide a context not only for how it",
          "Impressive Roman Aqueduct - a must-see UNESCO world heritage site. Museum is very interesting. Parking included in ticket price, cheapest version of 8.50\u20ac is sufficient. Nice walk along river.",
          "Wow absolutely stunning! We got there quite late in the day so did not have time to do more than glance through the museum, but the aqueduct itself was stunning. Also worth the walk to the viewing area back over the aqueduct.",
          "Nothing prepares you for the majestic site of this bridge as it comes into view. You can view it from both sides of the river and the three tiers are just amazing. As you come up to the bridge, if you go down the track on the right, by the river you can get all three arches",
          "Easy to get to and what a marvel of Roman architecture. It is amazing that this was almost torn down several times throughout history. The Roman's really knew how to build needed systems.",
          "Having seen pictures of the aqueduct in textbooks ever since high school, I was ready and willing to be amazed. The museum and its interactive exhibits were fascinating, and my friends and I stayed considerably longer than expected. The Pont itself defies description and must",
          "Pictures simply cannot do justice to the majesty of this 2000-year old Roman aqueduct which bridges the Gardon River outside Nimes and not far from Uzes and Avignon. One has a choice of tickets, so if you have never been there before, we strongly suggest seeing not only the",
          "Went with my son as part of our road trip and spent many hours here longer than we expected. The heat was a bit oppressive but the tree shade helped and the visitor centre shade was a relief. You can do as much or as little as you want and with my walking limited I managed to",
          "Wonderful place to visit for those who love Roman ruins - although this one is in excellent shape. There is a museum which describes the building of the aqueduct and its long route. Then you can walk up and cross a bridge that was built to give access to the whole thing.",
          "You can approach the bridge from the left or right banks. Parking fee is included in the entry ticket. 5-7 minute walk from the ticket office to the bridge. You can walk across the bridge on the lower level. Quite a few people and selfie sticks around. The river when I visited",
          "This UNESCO World Heritage site is worth whatever inconvenience to see. The film and exhibitions are also worth the time and a nice introduction. Allow a few hours.",
          "Pont Du Gard is a spectacular Roman aqueduct set in an attractive pedestrianized area where you can walk, swim, eat lunch, visit the museum and see a film show. Charges: You pay to park your car - but can visit the whole site for free. If you want to visit the film and the",
          "An incredible piece of history, immense architecture and brilliant engineering. Worth the early rise, arrived at opening with a few cars, so had place to ourselves. Very atmospheric, incredible sight, I cried with the spectacle. Worth crossing bridge, then walking north along",
          "Well worth the drive excellent views and fantastic scenery, from both sides of the river a little more on the history side could have been more visible",
          "What a fantastic place history brought to life. You need most of a day to get the most out of this venue. Cost is very good value for money.",
          "We started our tour with an interesting film show of the structure and how it was constructed. Then a tour of the museum showing artifacts and construction methods used in the building. It is a reasonable walk from the entrance to the actual aqueduct. It was a lovely warm day so",
          "Brilliant place to spend the day, we explored the site which is easy to find. We had a hire car and parking was plentiful, we paid the 8 euros each just to explore the bottom tear and chill on the beach. Would go back again tomorrow, really stunning place to chill on a hot day.",
          "An amazingly well preserved Roman structure in a stunning setting. Probably should have done the full tour which includes access to the third tier. That said, walking across and going down to the river give a great perspective of scale and purpose. Have seen photos of it all my",
          "Magnificent bridge. Three stories high. Huge. Easy walking from the parking lot fantastic spot for photographers.",
          "If in this part of France, a visit to this site is a must. An unbelievable feat of engineering and testament to that feat is the fact that after 2000 years it us still basically intact. There is an excellent Museum as you enter that has wonderful exhibits that explains how",
          "I stayed in a small French town called Remoulins which was so close to Pont du Gard (the famous Roman aqueduct) you could ride a bike there. It costs six Eros to get in but that was well worth it. A beautiful park set up besides the Gardon river. As I turned the corner there",
          "Spectacular piece of heritage. Well worth seeing. Take the trip to the top (signed 'view point') to get a view from above. One word of warning - the parking is expensive. Ticket machine issues a parking ticket but it must be taken to the payment office closer to the site prior",
          "can get here on the local bus from the bus station just next to the railway station in Avignon. The busses are not frequent though so check out the latest timetables. Bus stops are at the rounabout just at the end of the road leading to the Pont. Worth getting the ticket that",
          "Our second visit and we echo some reviews about how stunning the aqueduct is and how the car park works. When walking about the area you forget about the cost but the car park is mystifying. On this occasion we hoped to do lunch and view but after parking and an extended walk we",
          "Amazing in size and beauty (especially as it used to be even bigger than its current size). Good information centre and museum with cafe and swimming and kayaking opportunities in the river. Definitely worth a visit. Those Romans sure knew how to build....",
          "Site of a Roman aquaduct. Very steep climb to the top, but absolutely worth the effort, even for sufficiently interested people still in their 70's!! Also followed water to its source several Km away.",
          "We happened across signs to Pont du Gard on the way from Nimes to The Ardeche. It was a fantastic find although it was a relatively short stop we did not want to pay to park. We were lucky to find a place a bit away just off the road and walked through a lovely wood on a",
          "One of the places i always wanted to visit, however, it is very difficult by public transport unless you want to take a bus from Nimes. We eventually took a half day trip organised from the Tourist Office in Arles. We arrived at Pont du Gard just after 9:00 in the morning and",
          "Many photographs have been taken and lots of words have been written about this piece of history. The thing which the photographs do not prepare you for is the sheer physical size of this structure, as few photographs I have seen include people for a point of reference. So while",
          "We were driving from Rustiques, France to Lake Annecy and had noticed that the Pont du Gard was not far off our route. Being a huge fan of all things Roman, we decided to swing by there. This entire region of France was heavily populated with Romans 2,000 years ago. Everywhere",
          "C'est magnifique. The structure is impressive and imposing. Signage is great and in three languages; the museum is informative. It is good value for money.",
          "Must see if visit south of France. The bridge was good but what made it better was the very informative museum that gave you a broad context for roman life in southern France. Did not go on tour where you get to go on top but passing bridge was fun! Good walks around!",
          "The bridge aqueduct is a stunning site with very interesting history but the bilingual guide was rushed to give the information in French then English and at one point left the anglophones behind totally. However she did give background info that made the visit more interesting.",
          "Great structure and a must for any fan of history. We had young kids so we didn't do this but I was recommended to canoe down the river (it's pretty calm). We took lunch in the restaurant over the river, pretty good and reasonable price given location. Take your swimming togs,",

          "Have been here many times before over the years. A long time ago one could park aside of the bridge for nothing, it was quiet then. Now it is exploited as a touristic attraction with high parking prices, but.... I would not have missed to see it another time, it is so",
          "Can't help but be impressed by this massive structure and wonder how it could be built in those days. Can very well make a day of it by swimming or khayaking in the crystal clear waters. Great spot for families.",

          "This structure is phenomenal. We added this to a journey between Nimes and Avignon without knowing too much, and not really having enough time to do it justice, but we all enjoyed it. It seems the entrance fee doesn't give you access to the top level...and how to access that was",

          "We visited today and bought the middle priced tickets which enabled us to have the 45 minute guided visit onto/into the upper 3rd level of the aqueduct. It was worth every penny - the view was stunning. The interior where the water originally flowed was fascinating. The guide",
          "This place is worth a visit \u20ac8-50 per adult (free parking) with a gift shop and toilets. You are just amazed to think this construction is so old and has survived.",
          "The enormity of the aqueduct only hits you when you stand below it. The river gently meandering past whilst this enormous structure towers above you. If your interest is in historical monuments and Unesco world heritage sites, this is a must for the list. From what I see",
          "It is incredible that such a large structure from Roman times has survived all this time. Beautiful setting; easy drive from Nimes, St. Remy, and surrounding area. You need to go to the gauche (left) bank. You do NOT need an expensive ticket-get the basic ticket which gives you",
          "A lovely stop to admire the architecture and history behind this aqueduct and bridge. Swimming and canoeing can be done along with enjoying a cafe near the water!",
          "If you are in the area this is a must see. it is amazing how the area has changed / improved over recent years. It used to be quite isolated, now it is a huge tourist area with lots on offer. The views of the river, to say nothing of the bridge, are superb.",
          "An amazing piece of ancient architecture. The site allows you to explore and find many different views of the structure. Given that a visit will only fill an hour or two, it's quite pricey.",
          "visited this place at the advice of a local and did not know that it was a unesco world heritage until i reached there. the aqueduct was impressive! the moment the structure came into sight while still afar, i was already in awe. the view of the aqueduct flanked the river and",
          "I was there with my family for Easter day and everything went perfectly. Probably the only littlr remark is that we didn't like the restaurant that is inside and there is not free wifii, but these are very little observations compared to the beauty of the place.",
          "You can enter site through museum (no longer can drive up to it). Museum has great collection of artifacts (e.g. tools used in construction), models of the aqueduct, and videos (showing working of aqueduct and how it it may have looked during construction). There are even"

        "wiki": "N\u00eemes ( NEEM, French: [nim] (listen); Occitan: Nimes [\u02c8nimes]; Latin: Nemausus) is the prefecture of the Gard department in the Occitanie region of Southern France. Located between the Mediterranean Sea and C\u00e9vennes, the commune of N\u00eemes has an estimated population of 151,001 (2016).Dubbed the most Roman city outside Italy, N\u00eemes has a rich history dating back to the Roman Empire when the city was a regional capital, and home to 50,000\u201360,000 people. Several famous monuments are in N\u00eemes, such as the Arena of N\u00eemes and the Maison Carr\u00e9e. Because of this, N\u00eemes is often referred to as the French Rome.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe site on which the built-up area of N\u00eemes has become established in the course of centuries is part of the edge of the alluvial plain of the Vistrenque River which butts up against low hills: to the northeast, Mont Duplan; to the southwest, Montaury; to the west, Mt. Cavalier and the knoll of Canteduc.\nIts name appears in inscriptions in Gaulish as dede matrebo Namausikabo = \"he has given to the mothers of N\u00eemes\" and \"toutios Namausatis\" = \"citizen of N\u00eemes\".Nemausus was the god of the local Volcae Arecomici tribe. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 4000\u20132000 BC ===\nThe Neolithic site of Serre Paradis reveals the presence of semi-nomadic cultivators in the period 4000 to 3500 BC on the site of N\u00eemes.The menhir of Courbessac (or La Poudri\u00e8re) stands in a field, near the airstrip. This limestone monolith of over two metres in height dates to about 2500 BC, and is considered the oldest monument of N\u00eemes.\n\n\n=== 1800\u2013600 BC ===\nThe Bronze Age has left traces of villages that were made out of huts and branches. The population of the site increased during the Bronze Age.\n\n\n=== 600\u2013121 BC ===\nThe hill of Mt. Cavalier was the site of the early oppidum which gave birth to the city. During the third and 2nd centuries BC a surrounding wall was built with a dry-stone tower at the summit which was later incorporated into the Tour Magne. The Volcae Arecomici people settled around the spring at the foot of Mount Cavalier and build a sanctuary to Nemausus there.\nThe Warrior of Grezan is considered to be the most ancient indigenous sculpture in southern Gaul.In 123 BC the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus campaigned against Gallic tribes in the area and defeated the Allobroges and the Arverni, while the Volcae offered no resistance. The Roman province Gallia Transalpina was established in 121 BC and from 118 BC the Via Domitia was built through the later site of the city.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nThe city arose on the important Via Domitia which connected Italy with Hispania.\nN\u00eemes became a Roman colony as Colonia Nemausus sometime before 28 BC, as witnessed by the earliest coins, which bear the abbreviation NEM. COL, \"Colony of Nemausus\". Veterans of Julius Caesar's legions in his Nile campaigns were given plots of land to cultivate on the plain of N\u00eemes.Augustus started a major building program in the city, as elswhere in the empire. He also gave the town a ring of ramparts 6 km (3.7 miles) long, reinforced by 14 towers; two gates remain today: the Porta Augusta and the Porte de France.\nThe Maison Carr\u00e9e dating from the late 1st c. BC is one of the best-preserved temples to be found anywhere in the former Roman Empire, and appears to be almost totally intact.\nThe great Nimes Aqueduct, many of whose remains can be seen today outside of the city, was built to bring water from the hills to the north. Where it crossed the River Gard between Uz\u00e8s and Remoulins, the spectacular Pont du Gard was built. This is 20 km (12 mi) north east of the city.  \nThe museum contains many fine objects including mosaic floors, frescoes and sculpture from rich houses and buildings found in excavations in and near the city. It is known that the town had a civil basilica, a curia, a gymnasium and perhaps a circus. The amphitheatre is very well preserved, dates from the end of the 2nd century and was one of the largest amphitheatres in the Empire. The so-called Temple of Diana dating from Augustus and rebuilt in the 2nd century was not a temple but was centred on a nymphaeum located within the Fontaine Sanctuary dedicated to Augustus and may have been a library.\nThe city was the birthplace of the family of emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161).\nEmperor Constantine (306-337) endowed the city with baths.\nIt became the seat of the Diocesan Vicar, the chief administrative officer of southern Gaul.\nThe town was prosperous until the end of the 3rd century when successive barbarian invasions slowed its development. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the nearby town of Arles enjoyed more prosperity. In the early 5th century the Praetorian Prefecture was moved from Trier in northeast Gaul to Arles.The Visigoths captured the city in 472.\n\n\n==== Finds from Roman Nimes in the Mus\u00e9e de la Romanit\u00e9 ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 4th\u201313th centuries ===\nAfter the Roman period the Christian Church, already established in Gaul since the 1st century AD, appeared to be the last refuge of classical civilisation, as it was organised and directed by a series of Gallo-Roman aristocrats. When the Visigoths were accepted into the Roman Empire, N\u00eemes was included in their territory in 472, even after the Frankish victory at the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 (507). The urban landscape went through transformation with the Goths, but much of the heritage of the Roman era remained largely intact.\nBy 725, the Muslim Umayyads had conquered the whole Visigothic territory of Septimania including N\u00eemes. In 736\u2013737, Charles Martel and his brother led an expedition to Septimania and Provence, and largely destroyed the city (in the hands of Umayyads allied with the local Gallo-Roman and Gothic nobility), including the amphitheatre, thereafter heading back north. The Muslim government came to an end in 752, when Pepin the Short captured the city. In 754, an uprising took place against the Carolingian king, but was put down, and count Radulf, a Frank, appointed as master of the city. After the events connected with the war, N\u00eemes was now only a shadow of the opulent Roman city it had once been. The local authorities installed themselves in the remains of the amphitheatre.\nCarolingian rule brought relative peace, but feudal times in the 12th century brought local troubles, which lasted until the days of St. Louis. During that period N\u00eemes was jointly administered by a lay power resident in the old amphitheatre, where lived the Viguier and the Knights of the Arena, and the religious power based in the Bishop's palace complex, around the cathedral, its chapter and the Bishop's house; meanwhile the city was represented by four Consuls, who sat in the Maison Carr\u00e9e.\nDespite incessant feudal squabbling, N\u00eemes saw some progress both in commerce and industry as well as in stock-breeding and associated activities.\nAfter the last effort by Raymond VII of Toulouse, St. Louis managed to establish royal power in the region which became Languedoc. N\u00eemes thus finally came into the hands of the King of France.\n\n\n=== Period of invasions ===\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries the Rhone Valley underwent an uninterrupted series of invasions which ruined the economy and caused famine. Customs were forgotten, religious troubles developed (see French Wars of Religion) and epidemics, all of which affected the city. N\u00eemes, which was one of the Protestant strongholds, felt the full force of repression and fratricidal confrontations (including the Michelade massacre) which continued until the middle of the 17th century, adding to the misery of periodic outbreaks of plague.\n\n\n=== 17th century to the French Revolution ===\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century N\u00eemes experienced a period of prosperity. Population growth caused the town to expand, and slum housing to be replaced. To this period also belong the reconstruction of Notre-Dame-Saint-Castor, the Bishop's palace and numerous mansions (h\u00f4tels). This renaissance strengthened the manufacturing and industrial potential of the city, the population rising from 21,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\nIn this same period the Fountain gardens, the Quais de la Fontaine, were laid out, the areas surrounding the Maison Carr\u00e9e and the Amphitheatre were cleared of encroachments, whilst the entire population benefited from the atmosphere of prosperity.\n\n\n=== From the French Revolution to the present ===\nFollowing a European economic crisis that hit N\u00eemes with full force, the Revolutionary period awoke the slumbering demons of political and religious antagonism. The White Terror added to natural calamities and economic recession, produced murder, pillage and arson until 1815. Order was however restored in the course of the century, and N\u00eemes became the metropolis of Bas-Languedoc, diversifying its industry into new kinds of activity. At the same time the surrounding countryside adapted to market needs and shared in the general increase of wealth.\nDuring the Second World War, the Maquis resistance fighters Jean Robert and Vinicio Fa\u00efta were executed at N\u00eemes on 22 April 1943. The N\u00eemes marshalling yards were bombed by American bombers in 1944.\nThe 2\u00ba R\u00e9giment \u00c9tranger d'Infanterie (2\u00baREI), the main motorised infantry regiment of the French Foreign Legion, has been garrisoned in N\u00eemes since November 1983.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nN\u00eemes is one of the warmest cities in France. The city has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), being wetter than a typical Mediterranean climate, especially for its moderately rainy summers. It's slightly inland, southerly location results in hot air over the city during summer months, temperatures above 34 \u00b0C are common in July and August, whereas winters are cool but not cold. Night temps under 0 \u00b0C are common from December to February, while snowfall occurs every year.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nSeveral important remains of the Roman Empire can still be seen in and around N\u00eemes:\n\nThe elliptical Roman amphitheatre, of the 1st or 2nd century AD, is the best-preserved Roman arena in France. It was filled with medieval housing, when its walls served as ramparts, but they were cleared under Napoleon. It is still used as a bull fighting and concert arena.\nThe Maison Carr\u00e9e (Square House), a small Roman temple dedicated to sons of Agrippa was built c. 19 BC. It is one of the best-preserved Roman temples anywhere. Visitors can watch a short film about the history of N\u00eemes inside.\nThe 18th-century Jardins de la Fontaine (Gardens of the Fountain) built around the Roman thermae ruins.\nThe nearby Pont du Gard, also built by Agrippa, is a well-preserved aqueduct that used to carry water across the small Gardon river valley.\nThe nearby Mont Cavalier is crowned by the Tour Magne (\"Great Tower\"), a ruined Roman tower.Later monuments include:\n\nThe cathedral (dedicated to Saint Castor of Apt, a native of the city), occupying, it is believed, the site of the temple of Augustus, is partly Romanesque and partly Gothic in style.\nThe Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de N\u00eemesThere is modern architecture at N\u00eemes too: Norman Foster conceived the  Carr\u00e9 d'art (1986), a museum of modern art and mediatheque, and Jean Nouvel designed the Nemausus, a post-modern residential ensemble.\nTree-shaded boulevards trace the foundations of its former city walls.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nN\u00eemes is historically known for its textiles. Denim, the fabric of blue jeans, derives its name from this city (Serge de N\u00eemes).\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of N\u00eemes increased from 128,471 in 1990 to 146,709 in 2012, yet the biggest growth the city ever experienced happened in 1968, with a growth of +23.5% compared to 1962.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nFrom 1810 to 1822, Joseph Gergonne published a scientific journal specializing in mathematics from N\u00eemes called Annales de Gergonne.\nThe asteroid 51 Nemausa was named after N\u00eemes, where it was discovered in 1858.\nTwo times per year, N\u00eemes hosts one of the main French bullfighting events, Feria de N\u00eemes (festival), and several hundreds of thousands gather in the streets.\nIn 2005 Rammstein filmed their #1 live Album V\u00f6lkerball in N\u00eemes, and are returning in 2017.\nMetallica's live DVD Fran\u00e7ais Pour une Nuit (English: French for One Night) was recorded in N\u00eemes, France, in the Arena of N\u00eemes on 7 July 2009, during the World Magnetic Tour.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nN\u00eemes-Al\u00e8s-Camargue-C\u00e9vennes Airport serves the city. The Gare de N\u00eemes is the central railway station, offering connections to Paris (high-speed rail), Marseille, Montpellier, Narbonne, Toulouse, Perpignan, Figueras and Barcelona in Spain and several regional destinations. The motorway A9 connects N\u00eemes with Orange, Montpellier, Narbonne, and Perpignan, the A54 with Arles and Salon-de-Provence.\nWork is almost complete on the construction of a high-speed TGV line, Contournement N\u00eemes \u2013 Montpellier bypassing N\u00eemes and Montpellier with the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.The new line opened to passenger service on 15 December 2019 together with a new TGV station at NIMES-PONT DU GARD, (a confusing name as it located some 12km from the city itself and 20km from the Pont du Gard).A new station is also to be opened at the same time on the existing route between N\u00ecmes and Avignon, thus providing connections between the new line and local rail service.\nN\u00eemes bus station is adjacent to the city centre railway station. Buses connect the city with nearby towns and villages not served by rail. https://www.laregion.fr/transports-gard-regulier\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe association football club N\u00eemes Olympique who has recently achieved promotion to Ligue 1 is based in N\u00eemes.\nWorld Archery Indoor World Cup takes place in N\u00eemes each year in mid January\nThe local rugby union team is RC N\u00eemes.\nThere is a professional volleyball team located here.\nOlympic swimming champion Yannick Agnel was born in N\u00eemes.\nThe city hosted the opening stages of the 2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cycling race.\n\n\n== Mayors ==\n\u00c9mile Jourdan, PCF (1965\u20131983)\nJean Bousquet, UDF (1983\u20131995)\nAlain Clary, PCF (1995\u20132001)\nJean-Paul Fournier, LR (since 2001)\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nN\u00eemes is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nCosti\u00e8res de N\u00eemes AOC\nCommunes of the Gard department\nCouncils of N\u00eemes\nFeria de N\u00eemes\nList of works by James Pradier\nThe works of Maxime Real del Sarte\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Nismes\", A Handbook for Travellers in France (8th ed.), London: J.

        "wiki": "Aigues-Mortes (French pronunciation: \u200b[\u025b\u0261m\u0254\u0281t]; Occitan: Aigas M\u00f2rtas) is a French  commune in the Gard department in the Occitanie region of southern France.  The medieval city walls surrounding the city are well preserved. Situated on the junction of the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te and the Chenal Maritime to Grau du Roy, the town is a favoured stop for canal craft and Dutch barges.\n\n\n=== Toponymy ===\nThe name \"Aigues-Mortes\" was attested  in 1248 in the Latinized form Aquae Mortuae, which means \"dead water\", or \"stagnant water\".  The name comes from the marshes and ponds that surround the village (which has never had potable water). The inhabitants of the commune are known as Aigues-Mortais or Aigues-Mortaises.The Occitan Aigas Mortas is equivalent to toponymic types in the Morteau Oil dialect cf. Morteau (Doubs): mortua Aqua (1105, VTF521) and Morteaue (Haute-Marne): mortua Aqua (1163, VTF521). Grau du Roy in French means \"pond of the King\". In Occitan, grau means \"pond with extension\". \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe foundation of the city is said to have been by Gaius Marius, around 102BC but there is no documentary evidence to support this.\nA Roman by the name of Peccius fitted out the first salt marsh and gave his name to the Marsh of Peccais. Salt mining started from the Neolithic period and was continued in the Hellenistic period, but the ancient uses of saline have not resulted in any major archaeological discovery. It is likely that any remains were destroyed by modern saline facilities.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 791, Charlemagne erected the Mataf\u00e8re Tower amid the swamps for the safety of fishermen and salt workers. Some argue that the signaling and transmission of news was not foreign to the building of this tower which was designed to give warning in case of arrival of a fleet, as for the Magne Tower at N\u00eemes.\nThe purpose of this tower was part of the war plan and spiritual plan which Charlemagne granted at the Benedictine abbey, dedicated to Opus Dei (work of God) and whose incessant chanting, day and night, was to designate the convent as Psalmody or Psalmodi. This monastery still existed in 812, as confirmed by an act of endowment made by the Badila from N\u00eemes at the abbey.At that time, the people lived in reed huts and made their living from fishing, hunting, and salt production from several small salt marshes along the sea shore. The region was then under the rule of the monks from the Abbey of Psalmody.\nIn 1240, Louis IX, who wanted to get rid of the dependency on the Italian maritime republics for transporting troops to the Crusades, focused on the strategic position of his kingdom. At that time, Marseille belonged to his brother Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, Agde, Count of Toulouse, and Montpellier, and King of Aragon. Louis IX wanted direct access to the Mediterranean Sea. He obtained the town and the surrounding lands by exchange of properties with the monks of the abbey. Residents were exempt from the salt tax which was previously levied so that they could now take the salt unconstrained.He built a road between the marshes and built the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower to serve as a watchtower and protect access to the city. Saint-Louis then built the Constance Tower on the site of the old Mataf\u00e8re Tower, to house the garrison. In 1272, his son and successor, Philip III the Bold, ordered the continuation of the construction of walls to completely encircle the small town. The work would not be completed for another 30 years.\nThis was the city from which Louis IX twice departed for the Crusades: the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and again for the Eighth Crusade in 1270 for Tunis where he died of dysentery.\nThe year 1270 has been established, mistakenly for many historians, as the last step of a process initiated at the end of the 11th century. The judgment is hasty because the transfer of crusaders or mercenaries from the harbour of Aigues-Mortes continued after this year. The order given in 1275 to Sir Guillaume de Roussillon by Philip III the Bold and Pope Gregory X after the Council of Lyons in 1274 to reinforce Saint-Jean d'Acre in the East shows that maritime activity continued for a ninth crusade which never took place.There is a popular belief that the sea reached Aigues-Mortes in 1270. In fact, as confirmed by studies of the engineer Charles Leon Dombre, the whole of Aigues-Mortes, including the port itself, was in the Marette pond, the Canal-Viel and Grau Louis, the Canal Viel being the access channel to the sea. The Grau-Louis was approximately at the modern location of La Grande-Motte.\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, Philip the Fair used the fortified site to incarcerate the Templars. Between 8 and 11 November 1307, forty-five of them were put to the question, found guilty, and held prisoner in the Tower of Constance.\n\n\n=== Modern and contemporary periods ===\nAigues-Mortes still retained its privileges granted by the kings. Curiously it was a great Protestant in the person of Jean d'Harambure \"the One-Eyed\", light horse commander of King Henry IV and former governor of Vend\u00f4me who would be appointed governor of Aigues-Mortes and the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower on 4 September 1607. To do this, he took an oath before the Constable of France Henri de Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, who was a Catholic and supported the rival Adrien de Chanmont, the Lord of Berich\u00e8re. The conflict continued until 1612, and Harambure, supported by the pastors of Lower Languedoc and the inhabitants, finished it by a personal appeal to the Queen. He eventually resigned on 27 February 1615 in favour of his son Jean d'Harambure, but King Louis XIII restored him for six years. On 27 July 1616 he resigned again in favour of Gaspard III de Coligny, but not without obtaining a token of appreciation for the judges and consuls of the city.\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, important works were being undertaken to facilitate access to Aigues-Mortes from the sea. The old Grau-Louis, dug for the Crusades, was replaced by the Grau-de-la-Croisette and a port was dug at the base of the Tower of Constance. It lost its importance from 1481 when Provence and Marseille were attached to the kingdom of France. Only the exploitation of the Peccais salt marshes encouraged Fran\u00e7ois I, in 1532, to connect the salt industry of Aigues-Mortes to the sea. This channel, said Grau-Henry, silted up in turn. The opening, in 1752, of the Grau-du-Roi solved the problem for a while. A final solution was found in 1806 by connecting the Aigues-Mortes river port through the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFrom 1575 to 1622, Aigues-Mortes was one of the eight safe havens granted to the Protestants. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused severe repression of Protestantism, which was marked in Languedoc and the C\u00e9vennes in the early 18th century by the Camisard War. Like other towers in the town, from 1686 onwards, the Constance Tower was used as a prison for the Huguenots who refused to convert to Roman Catholicism. In 1703, Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards, managed to escape with sixteen companions.During the French Revolution, the city was called Port-Pelletier. At that time the port had almost disappeared due to silting, induced by the intensification of labour in the watershed at the same time as the clearing of woods and forests following the abolition of privileges. The decline of forest cover led to soil erosion and consequently a greater quantity of alluvial deposits in the ports of the region. Thus, in 1804 the prefect \"Mr. de Barante p\u00e8re\" wrote in a report that: \"The coasts of this department are more prone to silting ... The ports of Maguelonne and Aigues Mortes and the old port of Cette no longer exist except in history\" he alerted: \"An inordinate desire to collect and multiply these forest clearings since 1790 ... Greed has devoured in a few years the resource of the future, the mountains, opened to the plough, show that soon naked and barren rock, each groove becoming a ravine; the topsoil, driven by storms, has been brought into the rivers, and thence into the lower parts, where it serves every day to find the lowest parts and the darkest swamps.\"\n\n\n=== The massacre of Italians (August 1893) ===\n\nIn the summer of 1893, the Compagnie des Salins du Midi launched a recruiting campaign for workers for the threshing and the lifting of salt. Hiring was reduced due to the economic crisis that hit Europe, so the prospect of finding a seasonal job was attractive in this year and there were a greater number of workers looking for work. These were divided into three categories nicknamed:\n\n\"Ard\u00e8che\" peasants, not necessarily native to Ard\u00e8che, who leave their land at this time of the season;\n\"Piedmontese\" consisting of Italians from throughout northern Italy and locally recruited by team leaders: the chefs du colle;\n\"tramps\" composed mainly of vagabonds.Because of the recruitment operated by Compagnie des Salins du Midi, the chefs de colle were forced to compose teams including both French and Italians. In the early morning of 16 August 1893 a fight broke out between the two communities that quickly turned into a struggle of honour. Despite the intervention of the justice of the peace and the police, the situation rapidly degenerated. Some tramps met in Aigues-Mortes and, saying that Italians had killed some Aiguemortais, swelled the ranks of the population and of people who had not managed to find employment. A group of Italians was then attacked and tried to take refuge in a bakery that rioters wanted to burn. The prefect called for troops at 4am, but they did not arrive on the scene until 18 hours after the drama.Early in the morning, the situation escalated and the rioters moved to the Peccais saltfields where there were the largest number of Italians. Police Captain Cabley, trying to provide protection, promised the rioters to hunt the Italians and escort them to the Aigues-Mortes Police Station. It was during the journey that the Italians attacked by the rioters were massacred by a crowd that the police were unable to contain. There were seven dead and fifty wounded, some of whom had lifelong consequences. This was the largest massacre of immigrants in the modern history of France and also one of the biggest scandals in its judicial history because no condemnation was ever pronounced.\nThe case became a diplomatic issue and the transalpine (Italian) foreign press took up the cause of the Italians. There were Anti-French riots in Italy. A diplomatic solution was found and the parties were compensated while the nationalist mayor Marius Terras was forced to resign.A theatrical play by Serge Valletti called Dirty August is based on the tragic events.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAigues-Mortes is located in the Petite Camargue some 90 km (56 miles) northwest of Marseille.  By road, Aigues-Mortes is about 33 km (21 miles) southwest of N\u00eemes, and 20 km (12 miles) east of Montpellier in a direct line. Access to the commune is by route D979 coming south from Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze to Aigues-Mortes town. Route D979 continues southwest through the commune to Le Grau-du-Roi. Route D62 also starts from Aigues-Mortes heading southwest parallel to D979 before turning eastwards and forming part of the southern border of the commune. Route D62A continues to Plan d'Eau du Vidourie.\nThe commune is composed of a portion of the wet plains and lakes of the Petite Camargue. It is separated from the Gulf of Lions (and, thus, the Mediterranean) by the town of Le Grau-du-Roi, however Aigues-Mortes is connected to the sea through the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te. There is only one other hamlet in the commune called Mas de Jarras Listel on the western border.\nThe Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te enters the commune from the northwest and the northeast in two branches from the main canal to the north and the branches intersect in the town of Aigues-Mortes before exiting as a single canal alongside route D979 and feeding into the Mediterranean Sea at Le Grau-du-Roi.A rail branch line from N\u00eemes passes through Aigues-Mortes from north-east to south-west, with a station in the town of Aigues-Mortes, to its terminus on the coast at Le-Grau-du-Roi.  This line also transports sea salt.\nThe communes of Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze and Le Grau-du-Roi are adjacent to the town of Aigues-Mortes. Its inhabitants are called Aigues-Mortais or Aigues-Mortise; in Occitan they are aigamortencs.\nAigues-Mortes is one of 79 member communes of the Sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale (SCoT) of South Gard and is also one of 34 communes in the Pays Vidourle-Camargue. Aigues-Mortes is one of the four communes of the Loi littoral of SCoT in the South of Gard.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nViticulture and asparagus\nBreeding of bulls and of Camargue horses. Both are raised almost wild in the surrounding marshes.The Camargue bull is smaller than the Spanish fighting bulls, stocky, with high horns and head. It measures about 1.40 m at the withers. It is primarily intended for bullfighting which is very popular in the region.\nThe Camargue horse is the ultimate companion for herdsmen to move into the marshes and herd bulls. According to some discoveries of bones, it seems that the ancestors of the Camargue horse date to the Quaternary period. The Camargue horse is not very large, about 1.50 m tall. It has a huge resistance adapted to the terrain. Its colour is brown at birth, gradually turning white after a few years.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nProduction of salt by the operation of the saltworks of the Salins group. Probably used since ancient times, the salt of Aigues-Mortes attracted fishermen and salt workers. The Benedictine monks settled nearby in the 8th century at the Abbey of Psalmodiet to exploit this valuable commodity in the Peccais Ponds. The salt has long been one of the main resources of the city. To achieve \"table salt quality\", water pumped from the sea travels more than 70 km in \"roubines\". The concentration of sodium chloride is from 29 to more than 260 g/kilo. Mechanically harvested salt is piled up in the twinkling \"camelles\" before being packaged. It is suitable for human consumption.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe medieval heritage from the 13th and 14th centuries of the commune and its proximity to the sea attract many tourists and residents of France.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== River ===\nThe city of Aigues-Mortes is a crossroads of canals:\n\nCanal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te from the north-east and leaving westward\nCanal de Bourgidou to the southeast, and joins the Petit Rh\u00f4ne via other channels to the limit of Gard and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne\nLe Grau-du-Roi, maintained since the Middle Ages and connecting Aigues-Mortes to the central part of Grau-du-Roi\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nThe Line N\u00eemes to Le Grau-du-Roi serves the towns and villages of Costi\u00e8res and the coastline, with a terminus at Le Grau-du-Roi. It is also used for the transport of salt produced by the saltworks of the Salins Group (see link below).\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe development of seaside tourism since the 1960s was marked by the construction of new resorts (La Grande-Motte) and the extension of existing facilities from Le Grau du Roi to Port-Camargue. To facilitate access to tourists, a coastal road network has been augmented and connected to the A9 motorway. Aigues-Mortes benefits in these ways:\n\nto the east, the road D58 connects the city to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and the commune of Arles. This road winds through the rice fields and the various ponds that make up the Camargue.\nto the west, the road D62 was enlarged for cars to make a quick connection to Montpellier\nto the north, the road D979 directly connects the town to the motorway at Gallargues-le-MontueuxThe bus 106 also connects Montpellier and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Municipal Administration ===\nThe municipal council consists of 29 members including the mayor, 8 deputies, and 20 municipal councilors.\nSince the last municipal elections, its composition is as follows:\n\nList of Successive Mayors of Aigues-Mortes\n\nMayors from 1944(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe town is the capital of the canton of the same name whose general counsel is Leopold Rosso, deputy mayor of Le Grau-du-Roi and president of the Community of Communes Terre de Camargue (UMP). The canton is part of the arrondissement of N\u00eemes and the second electoral district of Gard where the member is Gilbert Collard (FN ).\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Distribution of age groups ===\nThe distribution of the population of the municipality by age group is as follows:\n\n47.6% of men (0\u201314 years = 17.7%, 15\u201329 years = 17.1%, 30\u201344 years = 22%, 45 to 59 years = 21.1% over 60 years = 22%)\n52.4% of women (0\u201319 years = 16.9%, 15\u201329 years = 15.1%, 30\u201344 years = 23.5%, 45\u201359 years = 19.9%, more than 60 years = 24.5%)The female population is over-represented compared to men. The rate of (52.4%) is substantially the same as the national rate (51.8%).\nPercentage Distribution of Age Groups in Aigues-Mortes and Gard Department in 2007\n\n\n== Local Culture ==\n\n\n=== The Aigues-Mortes Fougasse ===\nFougasse was one of the first pastries which could rise. It can be sweet (sometimes called \"tarte au sucre\" or sugar tart) or salty (with or without gratillons).\nTraditionally, making sweet fougasse in Aigues-Mortes was reserved for the Christmas period, as part of the Thirteen desserts. Based on a brioche dough, sugar, butter, and orange blossom, it was made by the baker with ingredients provided by the client. Now Aigues-Mortes fougasse sells all year.\n\n\n=== Lou Drap\u00e9 ===\nLou Drap\u00e9 is an imaginary horse mentioned in local folklore, which was supposed to walk at night around the ramparts of the city and take 50 to 100 children on his back, and disappear to \"nowhere\".\n\n\n== Historical sites ==\nAigues-Mortes has a very large number of sites registered as historical monuments.\n\n\n=== The Tower of Constance and the ramparts ===\n\nThe Tower of Constance was built in 1242 by Saint-Louis on the former site of the Mataf\u00e8re Tower which was built by Charlemagne around 790AD to house the king's garrison. The construction was completed in 1254.\nIt is 22 metres in diameter with a height of either 33 or 40 metres depending on the source. The thickness of the walls at the base is 6 metres.\nOn the ground floor, there is a guardroom protected by a portcullis. In the middle of the room, there is a circular opening leading to the cellar which served as a pantry, storage of ammunition as well as for dungeons. These areas were called the \"culs de basse fosse\", an old way of saying underground dungeons in French.\nOn the first floor, there is the knight's hall. Structurally it is similar to the guardroom. It was in this room that the Protestants were imprisoned during the 18th century, most notably Marie Durand, who engraved the word \"r\u00e9sister\" (English: resist) into the edge of the well which can be seen to this day. She was imprisoned at the age of 15, and was freed 38 years later, along with political prisoners such as Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards.\nBetween these two rooms, a narrow, covered way was built within the walls to keep watch on the room below.\nAfter the knight's hall, there is an entrance to the terrace which offers a wide panoramic view of the region, making it an ideal position for surveillance.  Sometimes, the prisoners were allowed to go on the terrace to get some fresh air.\nThe ramparts stretch for a distance of 1650 metres.\nSpectacular in their height and their state of preservation even though they were not restored in the 19th century, as was Carcassonne for example, they remain in a well preserved state. Along with the Tower of Constance, they are a testimony to Western European military architecture in the marshlands during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Carbonni\u00e8re Tower ===\n\nLocated in the commune of Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze, the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower was first referred to in an old text from 1346 specifying the function of the structure. It said, \"this fortress is the key to the kingdom in this region.\" Surrounded by salt marshes, the fortress was the only passageway into Aigues-Mortes. It was guarded by a garrison made up of a ch\u00e2telain and several guards. From the terrace, which could support up to four cannons, there is a panoramic view of Petite Camargue.\n\n\n=== The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons ===\nThe Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons is a Gothic-style church and was probably built before the ramparts in the mid-13th century during the time of Saint-Louis. In 1537 it served as a Collegiate church but was later vandalized by Protestants in 1575. After the reconstruction of the bell tower in 1634 it later served as a Temple of Reason during the French Revolution, a barracks, grain merchant, and a salt warehouse. It was re-established as a place of worship in 1804 and the building was restored in the neo classical-baroque style. Between 1964 and 1967 all of the 19th century decor was removed, notably the coffered ceilings, resulting in the much more basic and medieval style church we see today. Since 1991, the stained-glass windows by Claude Viallat, a contemporary artist belonging to the \"Supports/Surfaces\" art movement, add extraordinary light and colour to the building.  With the exception of a few statues, the rest of the 18th and 19th century furniture disappeared during this period. The fa\u00e7ade is crowned by a simple bell-gable housing 3 bells. The largest of the three is 1.07 metres in diameter. It was dated to 1740, cast by master smelter Jean Poutingon, and has been designated a historical monument of France. The church also houses a statue of Saint-Louis.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Chapel of the Gray Penitents ===\nThe Chapel of the Gray Penitents is located to the east of the Place de la Viguerie. It is the property of the Brotherhood of Grey Penitents established in 1400. The facade is in the style of Louis XIV. The entrance door is from the 17th century and is decorated with a wooden statue. The altarpiece was carved in 1687 by Sabatier.\nInside, an altarpiece represents the passion of Christ. It was built of gray stucco plaster in 1687 by the sculptor Sabatier from Montpellier. This altar, on which are the arms of the brotherhood, occupies the back of the choir.\n\n\n=== The Chapel of the White Penitents ===\nThe Chapel of the White Penitents is located at the corner of the Rue de la R\u00e9publique and Rue Louis Blanc. It belongs to the Brotherhood of the White Penitents which was created in 1622.\nAbove the choir, on the roof, there is a copy of the Retable of Jerusalem where Christ celebrated the Passover and Holy Thursday with his apostles. Around the high altar, a painting on canvas traces the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It is attributed to Xavier Sigalon a painter born in Uz\u00e8s in 1778 . On each side of the choir stand two statues: on the left Saint Felix for the redemption of captives, on the right James, son of Alphaeus, first Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\n\n=== Saint-Louis Square ===\n\nThis is the touristic heart of the city. In the centre, opposite the main entrance of the Porte de la Gardette, stands the statue of Saint-Louis, the work of James Pradier in 1849.\n\n\n=== Plan des Theatres ===\nThe Plan des Theatres are arenas for the Camargue bullfights. They were listed in 1993 on the inventory of the list of Historic Monuments (MH) for their ethnological and cultural interest. They can accommodate more than 600 people.\n\n\n== Aerial Views ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Literary references ===\nErnest Hemingway's third major posthumous work, the novel The Garden of Eden, takes place in Aigues-Mortes.\nWayne Koestenbaum set his 2004 novel Moira Orfei in Aigues-Mortes in Aigues Mortes.\nMichael Moorcock's Hawkmoon novels feature Aigues Mortes as the site of Castle Brass and capital city of a futuristic \"Kamarg\".\nGiovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron, Second Day, Seventh Story, as the place the king's daughter was shipwrecked in her false explanation of her four-year absence.\n\n\n== Notable people linked to the commune ==\nEmmanuel Theaulon, playwright, born in Aigues-Mortes on 14 August 1787.\nMichel M\u00e9zy, former footballer, born in Aigues-Mortes on 15 August 1948.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, one of the founders of Impressionism, represented Aigues-Mortes in one of his paintings.\nMaurice Fontaine, former senator and mayor.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the Gard department\nList of works by James Pradier Statue of Saint Louis\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simien, Aigues-Mortes, \u00e9ditions Alan Sutton, 2006.

          "Incredible place defenetly worth the visit. Take the train tour as is much enjoyable with guided tour and stops including a little museum.",
          "Unfriendly, ignorant and rude! We wanted to do a train tour. When I wanted to buy the tickets the lady at the counter ignored me. I asked a Shop assistant when the next train leaves - the lady at the ticket counter heard it and told her \u2026",
          "We did the train ride tour. Beautiful views, very friendly driver and very interesting. I only wish that the information on the train was also in English. If you are going there and have a bike you\u2019re in luck since you can bike wherever you want and stop for pictures wherever you want.",
          "The trip on the little train was brilliant. Now I\u2019ve read reviews by English people saying it was bad because there was no translation but I say embrace the opportunity to just listen to some French and appreciate the views which are \u2026",
          "The park is very good, but I suggest a visit by bike. Train is too fast, French speaking only and it stops few times.",
          "Huge salt production center. Interesting for childrens and adults. Beautiful view of the ancient city walls. Explanations in French.",
          "An interesting mini-train tour which takes you around the salt field of nice scenery and you have the chace to climb the salt mountain as well. The driver served as guide which was conducted in French which I could not understand. The trip was a bit dusty.",
          "You can visit this place only with the little train-tour. The tour is middle-rate and photographers like me will be disappointed: not enough stops and time to take pictures of the rose \u00e9tang de ville and the flamingos and other nice spots \u2026",
          "Great visit to the salt flats. You'll embark on a one hour tram ride that will show you the salt basins while learning about the ancient techniques still used. ",

        "wiki": "Do\u00f1ana National Park is a natural reserve in Andalusia, southern Spain, in the provinces of Huelva (most of its territory), C\u00e1diz and Seville. It covers 543 km2 (209.65 sq mi), of which 135 km2 (52.12 sq mi) are a protected area. The park is an area of marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes in Las Marismas, the delta where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It was established as a nature reserve in 1969 when the World Wildlife Fund joined with the Spanish government and purchased a section of marshes to protect it. The eco-system has been under constant threat by the draining of the marshes, the use of river water to boost agricultural production by irrigating land along the coast, water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities. It is named after Do\u00f1a Ana de Silva y Mendoza wife of the seventh Duke of Medina-Sidonia.\nDo\u00f1ana National Park has a biodiversity that is unique in Europe, although there are some similarities to the Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional de Camargue of the Camargue river delta in France, with which Do\u00f1ana Park is twinned. The park features a great variety of ecosystems and shelters wildlife including thousands of European and African migratory birds, fallow deer, Spanish red deer, wild boars, European badgers, Egyptian mongooses, and endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx.\nThe Do\u00f1ana nature reserve includes both the Do\u00f1ana National Park, established in 1969, and the Natural Park, created in 1989 and expanded in 1997, creating a buffer zone of protection under the management of the regional government. The two parks, national and natural, have since been classified as a single natural landscape. Due to its strategic location between the continents of Europe and Africa and its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, Do\u00f1ana's large expanse of salt marsh is a breeding ground as well as a transit point for thousands of European and African birds (aquatic and terrestrial), and hosts many species of migratory waterfowl during the winter, typically up to 200,000 individuals. Over 300 different species of birds may be sighted there annually. Considered the largest nature reserve in Europe, several different scientific institutions have monitoring stations within its boundaries to ensure appropriate development of adjacent lands and conservation of the threatened species that inhabit it. The area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994; in 2006 the park recorded 376,287 visitors.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, a herd of feral dromedaries roamed the area. They may have been introduced during the Moorish Conquest of Spain in the 8th century, or they may have escaped from a herd introduced by the Marquis de Molina as beasts of burden in 1829. By the 1950s, there were only eight individuals left, and these were threatened by poachers.\n\n\n== Geology and geomorphology ==\n\nThe geological profile of Do\u00f1ana National Park reflects the development over several hundred thousand years of a deep aquifer and geomorphological features that have enhanced the biodiversity of the wildlife habitats presently found there. After the end of the last glacial period, the area was covered by freshwater and brackish marshes, ponds and sand dunes, with some marine intrusions caused by high-energy events such as tsunamis and large storms. A period of comparatively rapid rise in global sea level during the first part of the Flandrian interglacial was associated with the melting of the paleoglaciers, and reached its maximum level 6,500\u20137,000 years ago. At this time, Do\u00f1ana National Park and the surrounding areas were flooded, and a lagoon, later called Lacus Ligustinus by the Romans, was formed. The pace of infilling of the lagoon has increased over the last 6,000 years, along with accelerated growth of sandspits and the creation of new inland marshes and wetlands. The extensive marshes of Do\u00f1ana National Park now have a flat topography, with some inland depressions occupied by temporary or permanent wetlands, locally called 'lucios'. The whole area is protected by the Do\u00f1ana spit, a wide sandy littoral barrier with mobile dune systems growing toward the southeast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAlthough the topography of Do\u00f1ana is a relatively new land feature as measured on the geological time scale, remains of Neolithic tools have been found in the area. Various ancient civilizations may have had a presence there as long as 2,800 years ago, including the Phoenicians, the Phocaean Greeks and the Tartessians, but archaeological remains attesting to such have not been found. In 1923, the German archaeologist Adolf Schulten, accompanied by Adolf Lammerer and George Bonsor, searched for the location of the ancient Tartessian capital in the Do\u00f1ana dunes, but found nothing of interest. These excavations were carried out at Cerro del Trigo and funded by the Duke of Tarifa and Denia, then owner of Do\u00f1ana. Nevertheless, in 1978 Schulten found the stele of Villamanrique at the nearby town of Villamanrique de la Condesa. Surveys were made in 2007 in the Hinojos salt marsh, or \"Marisma de Hinojos\", of Huelva province, in an effort to discover traces of the mythical city. Noteworthy finds included the remains of Roman settlements, dating from the 2nd through the 5th centuries AD, which had been primarily engaged in fishing and fish salting or the preparation of garum. The Guadalquivir Marshes (Las Marismas del Guadalquivir), an area of marshy lowlands near the left bank of the mouth of the Guadalquivir, was then a large inland lake known as the Lacus Ligustinus in Latin. The lake slowly infilled with deposited sediment, gradually giving way to the current marshes.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAlfonso X the WiseIn 1262, after conquering the vassal kingdom of Niebla, King Alfonso X established a Real Cazadero (royal hunting preserve) in the Las Rocinas forest, between the Rio Tinto and the Guadalquivir, partly due to the abundance of deer there, as well as the small sanctuary of Santa Olalla, since disappeared, on the Arroyo de la Rocina.\nIn 1297, his son Sancho IV granted Guzm\u00e1n el Bueno the Lordship of Sanl\u00facar, consisting of the territory located behind Arenas Gordas on the left bank of the Guadalquivir estuary, and which remained in the hands of the House of Medina-Sidonia for over six centuries. The noble house was established in 1369, when Henry II of Castile granted the fourth Lord of Sanl\u00facar the County of Niebla. In 1493 the Catholic Monarchs donated part of the land of the present village of El Roc\u00edo to the royal secretary, whose son later sold it to the town of Almonte. Previously, new breeding stock had been introduced among the local populations of wild boar and deer, while wolf hunting was encouraged for the benefit of cattle and horse ranching.\n\nIn the region of Niebla, specifically at Las Rocinas, the land is flat, covered by thickets, and wild boars are always to be found there... ...one may not traverse this ground in the winter, which is generally very wet, except during a drought, nor in summer because it is then so dry and miserably uncomfortable. ~Alfonso XI in his Libro de la Monter\u00eda (The Book of Hunting), written between 1342 and 1348\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\nNearly a century later, Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia and commander of the Spanish Armada, bought back part of the land. His wife, Ana de Silva y Mendoza, daughter of the Princess of Eboli, moved to a country retreat there called \"Coto de Do\u00f1a Ana\" (Do\u00f1a Ana Game Preserve), which was the origin of the current name \"Do\u00f1ana\"; the house was renovated years later as a palace. Reference to the use of Coto Donana as a hunting lodge is made in the first verses of the La F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea), which the lyric poet Luis de G\u00f3ngora dedicated to the Count of Niebla, and in which he requests that the nobles suspend their hunting exploits to hear his verses. In 1624, King Philip IV stayed at the estate for several days as a guest of the 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia, and joined in some large hunts. He brought with him a great variety of comestibles, which included such luxuries as snow from the mountains for the frequent banquets he held in honor of the duke. In 1797 Francisco Goya stayed in the palace as a guest of his patrons, the 15th Duke of Medina-Sidonia and his wife, the 13th Duchess of Alba. Here Goya created his \u00c1lbum A, a collection of drawings, and apparently painted his famous portraits, La Maja Vestida (\"The Clothed Maja\") and La Maja Desnuda (\"The Naked Maja\"), rumored to portray the duchess.\n\n\n=== Late modern, creation of the National Park ===\nAfter 1854, with the publishing of a discussion of the area in a treatise called \"Avifauna de Do\u00f1ana: Cat\u00e1logo de las aves observadas en algunas provincias andaluzas\" (\"Avifauna of Do\u00f1ana: Catalogue of the birds observed in some Andalusian provinces\"), by Antonio Machado y Nunez, the public began to appreciate its ecological value for the many different species of wildlife found there. Consequently, it was visited by British naturalists and hunters including Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck, both of whom wrote books that alerted a wider audience in Europe to the strategic importance of Do\u00f1ana for migratory birds traveling to Africa. Later, when Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Caro (1865-1915) became the 19th Duke of Medina Sidonia, he inherited large debts and to pay them was forced to sell off various assets, including the Coto de Do\u00f1ana, which he sold for 750,000 pesetas, finally detaching it from the noble house.\nWhen the sherry baron William Garvey bought Do\u00f1ana from the Duke in 1901, the estate was abandoned and in a state of ruin. Garvey restored the palace to its former splendor, and upon his death it passed to his brother Joseph and his niece Maria Medina y Garvey, who was married to the Duke of Tarifa, a forest engineer. In 1934 it passed to the sister of the Duchess of Tarifa, Blanca Medina and Garvey, who was married to the Marquis of Borghetto. In 1942, the Marquis sold it to a company formed by Salvador Noguera, Manuel Gonzalez and the Marquis of M\u00e9rito. Fifty years later the park was consolidated as a natural area.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\n\nThe Spanish businessman Mauricio Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon y D\u00edez, Marquis of Bonanza, whose family owned a large estate in Do\u00f1ana, became interested in its ecosystems and their birdlife, and invited ornithologists from all over Europe to visit. In 1952, the Spanish ornithologists Jos\u00e9 Antonio Valverde and Francisco Bernis visited the property, with Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon serving as their guide. Valverde and the Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon family saw that the wetlands, with their richly diverse wildlife, were threatened by the Spanish government's proposals to drain them for farming and the planting of eucalyptus trees. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning the plans. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953 Bernis had finished a report on the status of the Do\u00f1ana which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought and obtained international support for their goals. The efforts of Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.Valverde led the first organised scientific expedition to the Donana in 1957, joined by the British naturalists Guy Mountfort, Roger Peterson, and Sir Julian Huxley. A group of European conservation experts \u2013 including Guy Monfort, Max Nicholson and Luc Hoffmann \u2013then demonstrated the crucial importance of the area as a stopover for birds migrating between the European and African continents. In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Do\u00f1ana for development of the Matalasca\u00f1as resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Do\u00f1ana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Do\u00f1ana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Do\u00f1ana and other Spanish ecosystems.\n\nIn 1969, the WWF again joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase another section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Do\u00f1ana National Park.\nThat same year the Do\u00f1ana National Park was created by decree, part of whose territory was owned by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad) and part still in private hands. Ten years later the protected area was expanded and the so-called \"Preparque Do\u00f1ana\" was created. In 1980, UNESCO recognised the Do\u00f1ana National Park as a Biosphere Reserve of 77,260 hectares. The Core Zone consists of 50,720 hectares in the National Park of Do\u00f1ana. The buffer zone is 54,250 hectares in the Natural Park of Do\u00f1ana. The altitude ranges from sea level to 40 meters above sea level. Unesco considers Do\u00f1ana of world significance, based on the variety of its ecosystems and the wide number of species they harbor. In 1982 it was included in the list of wetlands of the Ramsar Convention, and in 1989 the Regional Government of Andalusia converted the Preparque into the Do\u00f1ana Natural Park. In 1994 it was listed by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, enabling the establishment of programs to preserve and manage the area. Historically, these vital wetlands have been constantly threatened by schemes to increase local agricultural output and tourism. WWF still supports the Do\u00f1ana, and is fighting proposals to drain the marshes and syphon off water for irrigation of agricultural land along the coast and expansion of tourist facilities.\nIn 1998, the Aznalc\u00f3llar Disaster occurred when a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine owned by Boliden-Apirsa (formerly Andaluza de Piritas, S.A.), the Spanish subsidiary of Boliden, releasing a flood of toxic sludge that entered the River Guadiamar, the main water source for the park. In 2000, after this major environmental catastrophe, the Spanish Ministry of Environment promoted the \"Do\u00f1ana 2005\" program, aimed at regenerating the marshes. In 2006 the responsibilities of maintaining the park were transferred to the Government of Andalusia by the Royal Decree of 9 June; the functions and services of the Nature Conservation administration thus transferred to the Andalusian state were widened, and Do\u00f1ana National Park and the Natural Park became the \"Natural area of Do\u00f1ana\", a single territory divided into areas with different levels of environmental protection. In 2008 this park was twinned with the Regional Natural Park Camargue in France, with which it shares anthropological and ethnographic aspects.\nDuring his tenure, the Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez began using Do\u00f1ana as a vacation retreat, setting a precedent for his successors. In 2010, 9200 hectares of land on the coastline were expropriated by the former Ministry of the Environment for protection. In July 2012, Unesco approved the extension of the Biosphere Reserve of Do\u00f1ana from 77,260 hectares to over 255,000 hectares and enabled compliance with the guidelines of the Man and Biosphere Program. This created a transition zone where the socio-economic interests of the various municipalities in the Do\u00f1ana region are represented.\nIn 2019, the police closed tens of illegal wells operated largely by fruit farmers around the park which had for many years been draining water away from the park's water table.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDo\u00f1ana Park has a mild, typically Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and relatively wet winters resulting from variations in the polar front and the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The rainy seasons are intermediate, occurring in spring and in autumn; autumn especially can produce torrential rains caused by the accumulation during the summer of heat in nearby large bodies of water, and the arrival of polar air masses. In winter, however, thermal anticyclones may occur locally. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, with maximum temperatures varying about 17 \u00b0C from winter to summer. The most significant feature of the climate is the three to five months of dry weather in the summer, when it is dominated by the subtropical anticyclone.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThere are many species of flora in the park: trees, including pines, flowers such as roses, and shrubs. Of special interest are the species Vulpia fontquerana, Tursica linaria, Juniperus macrocarpa (maritime juniper), Micropyropsis tuberosa, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae or Thorella verticillatinundata, many of them endangered. Non-native species such as eucalyptus, Acacia longifolia, Gomphocarpus fruticosus, Nicotiana glauca or Carpobrotus edulis (cat's claw) are removed by the park service.\nOther notable species in the park, of the more than 875 indigenous to the Do\u00f1ana ecosystems are: oleander, oak, the sea wallflower, sweet saltwort, the prickly tumbleweed, marram grass, heather, camarina, lavender, sea holly, reed, carnation, bulrush, common fern, sage-leaved rock rose, rushes, labi\u00e9rnago (Phillyrea angustifolia), sea spurge, mastic, sedge, palm, pine, Scotch broom, rosemary, juniper, gorse, thyme, spurge and  blackberries.\n\n\n=== Flora of the transdunes ===\n\nThe ecosystem of the mobile dunes, also known as transdunes, which are formed by the prevailing south-west wind, is almost nonexistent elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula. The harshness of this ecosystem is evident in the adaptations made by some plant species to its special conditions: the dunes of sand and soil are inconsistent. The gradual burial of vegetation, especially of trees that emerge then die, killed by the slow movement of sand, is one of the most well-known phenomena in the beach area of the park.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nThere are 20 species of freshwater fish cataloged in the Park, 10 of amphibians, 13 of reptiles, 37 of mammals and 360 non-marine birds, of which 127 have nesting seasons in the park.\n\n\n=== Fish ===\nNative fish such as eel inhabit Do\u00f1ana as well as introduced species such as carp, and the gambusia, or pike, which is considered an invasive threat to local ecosystems.\n\n\n=== Reptiles and Amphibians ===\nReptiles and amphibians found in Do\u00f1ana Park include: the western cowl snake, southern smooth snake, blind snake, Montpellier snake, grass snake, Carbonell lizard, red-tailed lizard, Ocellated lizard, common frog, tree frog, painted toad, common toad, natterjack toad, spadefoot toad, dwell turtle, vipers, Iberian newt, marbled newt, common gecko, European pond turtle, and the common chameleon.\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\nThe following is a list of birds that inhabit the park: hobby, bee-eater, hoopoe, dunnock,Egyptian  vulture, stone curlew, gadwall, mallard, widgeon, snipe, black-tailed godwit, imperial eagle, booted eagle, short-toed eagle, Bonelli's eagle, Montagu's harrier, marsh harrier, hen harrier, gannet, shrike, lark, greylag goose, bean goose, redshank, lapwing, little bittern, long- eared owl, griffon vulture, black vulture, great reed warbler, teal, white stork, black stork, black-winged  stilt, ringed plover, Kentish plover, cormorant, raven, cuckoo, spoonbill, crested coot, toed eagles, sandpipers, duck, quail, redstart, black redstart, merlin, black starling, starling, Flamingo, coot, horned coot, whiskered tern, black tern, pin-tailed sandgrouse,  little egret, squacco heron, herring gull, Audouin's gull, black-headed gull, dark gull, purple heron, gray heron, barn swallow, red-rumped swallow, sparrow, house sparrow, tree sparrow, Spanish sparrow, jackdaw, honey buzzard, peregrine falcon, crested tit, blue- tit, goldfinch, eared owl, barn owl, kingfisher, heron, black kite, red kite, common blackbird, glossy ibis, chiffchaff, cattle egrets, teals, bittern, little egret, white wagtail, yellow wagtail, purple gallinule, penduline  tit, woodcock, brown nighthawks, wood pigeon, shoveler, robin, spotted woodpecker, finch, woodpecker, moorhen, pochard, woodlark, little grebe, mistle thrush, song thrush, curlew, magpie, swift, greenfinch, oriole, Cetti's warbler, nightingale, little bustard, great crested grebe, shelduck, pied flycatcher, spotted flycatcher, common flycatcher, tufted duck, pochar, ferruginous duck, azure-winged magpie, buzzard, common buzzard, common scoter, short-toed lark, stonechat, merganser, firecrest, gull-billed tern, siskin, water rail, bunting, reed bunting, black-bellied sandgrouse.\n\n\n=== Mammals ===\nDeer, rabbit, European hedgehog, genet, wild cat, wild boar, iberian lynx (endangered species), dormouse, mongoose, bat, cave bat, greater horseshoe bat, buzzard bat, shrew, otter, mouse, polecat, fox, badger, water rat, black rat, lesser noctule.\n\n\n==== Iberian lynx ====\n\nThe Iberian lynx, whose habitat is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula, is the most endangered of the big cats. Precipitous drops in population counts due to the drastic reduction of fish stocks that are its main food source led to its being declared a protected species in 1966. The only extant colonies of the Iberian lynx are in the Natural Parks of Sierra de Andujar and Cardena, Montoro, and Do\u00f1ana with its surroundings; the other mainland colonies of former times are considered extinct. In Portugal recovery efforts to preserve its remaining habitat have resulted in the creation of the Sierra Malcata Natural Reserve.\nThe Acebuche Breeding Centre in Do\u00f1ana has developed a captive breeding program which has achieved the survival of eleven individuals born in the centre, and of over thirty captured in the park, whose survival was otherwise doubtful. These conservation efforts are threatened by a high mortality rate among the cats and recurring violations of laws prohibiting cars from entering the park or driving on its roads, although, as some agencies have reported, the causes of death are not always clear. The precarious survival situation of this animal has become an emblematic symbol of the park for the general public.\n\n\n==== Horses ====\nIn Do\u00f1ana there are two indigenous breeds of horse: the marsh horse and the Retuertas horse; the latter is one of the oldest European breeds, dating to perhaps 1000 BC, and the only one living in the wild and isolated from other populations.\n\n\n==== Camels ====\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, a herd of feral dromedaries roamed the area. They may have been introduced during the Moorish Conquest of Spain in the 8th century, or they may have escaped from a herd introduced from the Canary Islands in 1829 by the Marquis de Molina as beasts of burden. By the 1950s, there were only eight individuals left, and these were threatened by poachers. By the early 1960s, there were only three, but more were released into the wild after being used in the filming of Lawrence of Arabia in 1962.\n\n\n== Natural Park of Do\u00f1ana: Preparque ==\nAbalario\u2013Asperillo. The coastal area west of the national park from Matalasca\u00f1as to Mazagon, forming a rectangle 25 km in length and reaching about 5 km inland, consists of a field of dunes, several ancient lagoons and wetlands, as well as a large forest of pine and eucalyptus trees. It shelters abundant wildlife, including the Iberian lynx. This zone includes the towns of Matalasca\u00f1as and Mazagon, as well as the El Arenosillo test Centre, a rocket launch site for suborbital rockets, but its declaration as a national park blocked the construction of a large urban project west of Matalasca\u00f1as.\nPreparque Norte\u2013Pinares de Hinojos (North Preparque Pinewoods of Hinojos) stretches north of the National Park from El Roc\u00edo to Hinojos, with areas of marsh and forest. The Pinar del Pinto of Coto del Rey, between Aznalc\u00e1zar and Villamanrique de la Condesa, is home to several species of raptors.\nPreparque Este\u2013Brazo de la Torre-Entremuros. An area east of the National Park, between Brazo de la Torre and the Guadalquivir, with marshes and ca\u00f1os (tidal channels that reach into the muddy marsh land). It attracts birds that inhabit Do\u00f1ana during the summer and during those winters in which drought occurs. Part of the marshes have been converted to rice cultivation.\nPinar de la Algaida\u2013Marismas de Bonanza. An area southeast of the National Park and north of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on the left bank of the River Guadalquivir, that includes a large forest of pines and marshes in Salinas. These marshes are the only ones still flooded by the tides (all the others rely solely on freshwater streams and rain for replenishment), and consequently, flamingos and avocets are found in them. \"Algaida\" is a word of Arabic origin, meaning generally any place covered with trees and bushes. El Pinar de la Algaida is located near the henarllo, a sanctuary dedicated to the female deity Astarte, and the site of the Roman well of Caveros.  Restocking has been practised at Algaida since the early 19th century, and it now contains a large colony of black kites.\n\n\n== Environmental Problems ==\nAfter the Aznalc\u00f3llar Dam disaster of 1998, public awareness of the environmental risks to which the countryside is exposed has increased. Various impact studies and environmental groups have warned repeatedly of problems that threaten the region's flora, fauna, water and soil. While the pressure of urbanization and its various demands on local ecosystems has been a concern throughout the years, this is not the only associated risk factor. UNESCO has reviewed the nomination of the park for inclusion in its \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" several times, but has yet to add it.\n\n\n=== Impact of infrastructure ===\nThere have been a number of problems related to infrastructure near the park. A project to build an oil pipeline between Extremadura and the port of Huelva has been criticized by environmental groups, who allege it would significantly increase tanker traffic in the area with an associated risk of oil spills. Frequent dredging of the Guadalquivir to allow passage of ships to the port of Seville has been observed to cause serious disturbances in the biodynamics of the estuary. Adena, the Associaci\u00f3n de defensa de la naturaleza (Association for the defence of nature), the Spanish branch of WFF, has linked the passage of these boats with the introduction of new animals to the local ecosystems, which occurs when they discharge ballast water containing exotic species.\n\nThe Port of Huelva, a few kilometers from the Natural Park, is one of its major environmental threats. Francisco Bella, PSOE senator and former mayor of the town of Almonte Huelva, considers it absurd that the pipeline project has been approved while the national government and the regional government of Andalusia invest in renewable energy. As mayor of Almonte, he noted the difficulties of implementing policies that promote employment near the park: (translation) \"...we know almost everything about the ant and the lynx, but need to know how employment evolves in Do\u00f1ana.\" In line with Bella's position regarding the aqueduct, Gin\u00e9s Morata, a biologist and former president of the Consejo de Participaci\u00f3n de Do\u00f1ana (Participation Council of Do\u00f1ana), says that the project, which involves the passage of hundreds of oil tankers per year that would unload their cargoes near Do\u00f1ana, would lead to an increased possibility of oil spills.\n\n\n=== Overexploitation of water resources ===\nAnother environmental problem is water withdrawals for irrigation, many of them illegal, which have doubled since the late 1980s to maintain water-intensive crops such as cotton, rice and more recently strawberries. The latter are grown in greenhouses, with an estimated area under plastic of between 4,500 and 6,000 hectares in the Do\u00f1ana area, producing over 60% of the Spanish strawberry crop. The boring of illegal wells to draw irrigation water from underground aquifers has apparently proliferated, while the water demands of nearby residential complexes and inappropriate usage of the water resources of nearby rivers may also affect the hydrology of the park. Other potential risks include salinization resulting from climate change; the intrusion of salt water from the Atlantic would endanger several animal species. On the other hand, desertification could also occur; recently a transfer from the Chanza-Stones water system was approved by the Diputaci\u00f3n de Huelva (Provincial Council of Huelva) to alleviate this eventuality.\n\n\n=== Impact of agriculture ===\nIn 2007, the World Wildlife Fund warned that strawberry farms surrounding the park, where 95% of Spanish strawberries were produced, threatened to cause catastrophic damage to the park by depleting the surrounding groundwater, notably where illegal boreholes were involved, as well as creating considerable pesticide pollution and plastic waste which was accumulating in local creeks; AFP further reported that WWF was calling for a boycott of Spanish strawberries, but this is contradicted by the remarks of a WWF-Spain spokesperson, and it is uncharacteristic of WWF to call for blanket boycotts.\n\n\n=== Aznalc\u00f3llar disaster ===\n \nOn 25 April 1998, a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine operated by the mining company, Boliden-Apirsa, near Aznalc\u00f3llar, Seville Province, releasing 4\u20135 million cubic metres of mine tailings. The acidic tailings, which contained dangerous levels of several heavy metals, quickly reached the nearby River Agrio, and then its tributary the River Guadiamar, travelling about 40 kilometres along these waterways before they could be stopped and advancing as far as the prepark. The cleanup operation took three years, at an estimated cost of \u20ac240 million. Although the spill was slowed by levees and diverted by way of the Guadalquivir to the sea, the vulnerability of Do\u00f1ana's ecosystems to such environmental catastrophes was evident.\nTo ensure sustainable development both in the countryside and in the surrounding provinces, as well as to counteract future environmental threats, an International Commission of Experts met in 1992 to propose solutions, and produced the Plan de Desarrollo Sostenible de Do\u00f1ana y su Entorno (Plan for Sustainable Development of Do\u00f1ana and its Surroundings), briefly described as:\n\nA plan of action, implemented through the Do\u00f1ana Operational Programme and funded by the regional government of Andalusia and the Spanish State, as well as the Feder Funds, ESF and EAGGF, to revitalise both the regional infrastructure and social fabric through a new economic model of development compatible with preserving the biodiversity of such an extraordinarily important natural heritage as Do\u00f1ana.\n\nThis effectively became the mission statement of the Do\u00f1ana 21 Foundation, created in 1997 as a partnership between the Governing Council of the Andalusian Regional Government and the El Monte, San Fernando and Unicaja savings banks. The plan established among its objectives the promotion of actions beneficial to the natural environment, seeking the cooperation of national and European governmental bodies, and the various organizations with an interest in the park, economic or otherwise, for sustainable development of the area (e. g., by encouraging the organic farming of rice). Since then, representatives from Council agencies, businesses, trade unions and conservation organizations such as WWF have joined the foundation and collaborated in meeting its goals.\n\n\n=== Pipeline ===\nIn 2013 the construction of a pipeline in the vicinity of the park was authorized by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment.\n\n\n=== Pilgrimage of El Roc\u00edo and ecological issues ===\n\nThe municipality of Almonte, and therefore the park, is situated in an area in which public manifestations of religious fervor have been frequent throughout the centuries. The deities of nature and water were worshiped by the ancient Iberians, as in the goddess cult of Cybele. The cult rituals, similar in many ways to current Rocieras celebrations, were quickly adapted by the early Christians of these lands to be assimilated in their liturgy. They built a small basilica here, now defunct, but it was mainly after the reconquest of the area in 1262 that the Marian devotions were institutionalized. About 1270\u20131284, Alfonso X reconstructed the Chapel of St. Mary of Rocinas, and in 1337 Alfonso XI made the first recorded mention of the Marian cult in the area:\n\n...e se\u00f1aladamente son los mejores sotos de correr cabo de una Iglesia que dicen de Santa Mar\u00eda de las Rocinas.(... and in particular it is said that the best groves proceed from the church of St. Mary of Rocinas.) ~Alfonso XI, 1337\nThe image of the Virgin at the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo dates probably from the 13th century, although the current iconography representing the Virgin as a lady of the royal court was adopted in the late 16th century, according to the fashion of the time. The popularity of the cult of the Virgen del Roc\u00edo in modern times has raised concerns about the annual pilgrimage's effect on the natural environment of the park.\nThe park is used by pilgrims on their way to the Romer\u00eda de El Roc\u00edo. As this event attracts a million pilgrims annually, it has a significant negative impact on the park's eco-system. The overcrowding of pilgrims around certain dates is evident not only in the village of El Roc\u00edo where the shrine is located, but also in places within and outside the park such as the Piara del Acebuchal, the Ajol\u00ed Bridge, Boca del Lobo and the Moguer road. This has been a publicity windfall for the park, but requires stepped-up park resources for fire prevention and general monitoring, and also has had a significant negative environmental impact (e.g., increased danger of wildfires, off-road SUVs damaging sensitive ground, etc.) denounced by environmentalists.\n\n\n== Do\u00f1ana Biological Station ==\nThe Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana (Do\u00f1ana Biological Station) is a centre dedicated to the study of terrestrial ecology. It was created jointly in 1964 by the Spanish government and the World Wildlife Federation to support scientific research on local ecosystems; in the course of this research the status of other national and international ecosystems is also investigated. The EBD, as an administrative and scientific management agency under the aegis of the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas \u2013 CSIC), operates a research centre in Seville, the Do\u00f1ana Biological Reserve in Almonte, and a Field Station in the Natural Park of Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in the province of Ja\u00e9n. After the World Wildlife Fund was created in 1961, one of its first actions was to acquire 6,794 hectares of the Do\u00f1ana estate 'Las Nuevas' in 1963, which it then turned over to the CSIC. The CSIC declared the area to be a Reserva Biol\u00f3gica (Biological Reserve) and in 1964 built the Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana. WWF bought another section of Do\u00f1ana in 1968 totaling 3,214 hectares and later called the Reserva Biol\u00f3gica de Guadiamar (Guadiamar Biological Reserve).\n\n\n== Saca de las Yeguas ==\nAnother important activity of longstanding association with the park is La Saca de las Yeguas (\"The Gathering of the Mares\"), a livestock event pertaining to the indigenous wild horses of the salt marshes of Do\u00f1ana. On 26 June, after the Feast of St. John the Baptist is celebrated, mares and new foals among the marisme\u00f1os are gathered in a traditional roundup.\n\n\n== Other points of interest ==\n\nAcebr\u00f3n Palace. It was built in the 1960s by Luis Espinosa Fondevilla as a residence and hunting lodge, and currently serves as the park visitors centre.\nMatalasca\u00f1as Dune Park and Marine World Museum. The Visitors Centre at Acebuche, located in an old farmhouse, is the point of departure for visits to the park. It has trails and bird observatories on the lake of the same name.\nIce House Visitors Centre. Located in Sanlucar de Barrameda in the mariners' barrio (neighborhood) of Bajo de Gu\u00eda, this early 20th century former ice house has been repurposed for receiving visitors to Do\u00f1ana National Park. Beside it is the dock for the Real Fernando, a boat that takes visitors up the River Guadalquivir to the town of La Plancha, where can be found marshland cabins and from which you access the Llanos de Vel\u00e1zquez (Vel\u00e1zquez Flats) and Llanos de la Plancha (La Plancha Flats), where there are natural observatories.\nBajo de Gu\u00eda Visitors Centre. Located in Sanlucar de Barrameda, devised for visitors to Do\u00f1ana Natural Park.\nHistoric Areas of the peoples of the Comarca (Region).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Sites of Community Importance in Andalusia\nCosta de la Luz\nList of Spanish national parks\nTartessos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDo\u00f1ana, Spain's Wildlife Wilderness, Juan Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez, Taplinger Publishing Company, New York, 1974, hardcover, 253 pages, ISBN 0-8008-8324-1\nWhere to watch birds in Do\u00f1ana by Jorge Garz\u00f3n, Francisco Chiclana.

          "Excellent opportunity to see the pink flamingos. Several marked paths and very easy to discover the delta with children without getting lost. Longer routes for fit people without kids. Toilets, bar etc organised. Free parking at least off season. Binoculars for rent. Not",
          "Camargue area is absolutely fascinating place and anybody who likes nature would love it, in my opinion. I usually don't enjoy very much flat landscape, I'm always much more intrigued in hilly or mountain areas. But Camargue really amazed me. The space is immense. And if you",
          "We went with a friend who had assured us that you always get to see the three core types of wildlife - black bulls, white horses, and especially the flamingoes - and we were not disappointed, seeing many groups of all three as we drove past the Etang de Vaccares nearer to the",
          "This is what my trip was all about seeing the white horses in their home -much samller than you would think but sturdy and strong. Live sie by side with the black bulls and flamingos",
          "We drove to the coast and then to view the \u00e9tang. Pleasant country and nice areas to stroll. It's a refreshing change from gritty Arles. We'd recommend allowing 4-5 hours to really see everything.",
          "Went with an elderly group, we all loved it and we're lucky enough to see the flamingoes. We missed the wild flowers, if we had gone a month or so earlier it would have been a glow of purple.",
          "Wonderful experience just 1hr drive from Marseille or Aix en Provence. We enjoyed a day out horse riding in the Camargue. Lovely to visit in Autumn, less tourists and mosquitos",
          "The Rhone delta is host to African flamingos, muskrats, herons, egrets, bulls, and white horses, as well as countless ducks. Go for the natural experience",
          "We caught the local bus that took us to the park and saw hundreds of pink flamingoes. It is the most beautiful setting with scores of different herons and bird species. If you are in the area , don't miss the opportunity for a visit.",
          "Beautiful park with varied and well designed routes. Recommended for those who love nature and enjoy peace",
          "We decided to drive back to our home in Piedmontese (Italy) from a holiday in Carcassone (France) via the Camargue and it was definitely worth the detour. Beautiful salt marshes, plenty of birds and wild horses to see without going too far out of your way and a great walk",
          "Very nice nature park and a must to see if you are in the region. We visited salt bassins and it's really interesting. In addition you can find a lot of animals (e.g. Flamingos)",
          "I come to France for the culture, the history, the food, and the beautiful old towns. If I spend precious time for nature, it better be breathtaking. The Calanques were worth it, but the Camargue wasn't. It's a pretty place, but unless you're willing to put great effort into",
          "We allocated almost half day to see this park and could not make all must-see-points, e.g. local museum, as we loved shallow sandy beaches there and spent good time. Still even while driving - car is a must - we enjoyed viewing various birds, bulls and horses. Park offers horse",
          "Imagined the protected area a lot bigger than what I have experienced. Still beautiful, but modern life is taking slices out of the park. Looks more like a tourist attraction on a large scale.",
          "If you visit Arles do not miss the Camargue Nature Park. It is a vast nature reserve with lots of water , flamingos,swans,ducks and many other water fowls. It has easy paths to stroll through. The white horses are quite a sight. It is a place not to be missed.",
          "Loved our drive thru the Carmargue. Glad we did a self drive because the highlights were easily seen. Signage was a bit of a challenge initially.",
          "The Camargue is a wonderful, unique landscape with flamingos, white horses, big bovines and other wildlife. There are small houses here and there, the homes of Les Guardians, the cowboys of the Camargue. There are nice walking paths and it's a great place to ride a bike, on",
          "I visit half-day Camargue. I was in beautifull town Sant Mary de la Mer and in Ornitologic park where I observed especially Flamengo birds. The countriside with white horses, bulls, Flamengo birds is lovely. Unfortunatlly I didn\u00b4t have more time to visit more places. For this",
          "We drove from Arles to Camargue and saw the white horses and Flamingo's which were all over the area.",
          "The Camargue is a huge wild area with lots of activities which is well worth a visit. It is a beautiful landscape with huge skies and lots of wildlife.",
          "We drove through virtually all of the nature park. If you are from the states, think Everglades... wetlands, long views and not much else. The walk on the beach in Saintes Maries was nice but in the summer, I suspect it would be packed with people. Go to the museum of the",
          "I loved Camargue because it seemed untouched by the modern way of life. Vast pastures, some fields, a lot of water everywhere, beautiful white horses . . . Everything seems so peaceful and at ease. One of the last almost untouched refuges in this part of the world.",
          "The Camargue is the flat, marshy bit of land where the Rhone empties into the sea, and it is amazing. Don't skip this! The tourist office has guides with walks of varying difficulty you can take, or you can rent a bike or ride a horse to get a feel for the landscape. Lots of",
          "The New Jersey meadowlands are actually nicer and less industrial than the Camargue. It was not at all what we expected with refineries, oil rigs and little nature. The beach was ok.",
          "\"Les Saintes Marie de la Mer\" is what you place in your car navigation address. First I strongly suggest you drive to the furthest point just passed this town, where you find the campers parked on the left. Then turn around and work your way back. My guess is many have NOT done",
          "Wide wild quiet... You just feel the smell of the sea. You just feel the smell of grass. You just feel the smell of soil. And if you are lucky yo can see flamingo!",
          "I would recommend taking a tour because there is so much to learn about this special place and also areas that only a 4X4 can enter",
          "We throughly enjoyed cycling through the Camargue. It is a really unique landscape (flamingos!) It is also very flat so everyone in our group enjoyed it. But the wind was very gusty at times so despite the flat it wasn't alway easy pedalling.",
          "Great to drive through but we also took a boat trip up the Little Rhone from Saints Marie sur Mer which was worthwhile",
          "We were there in March and we did see flamingos and some of the black bulls that are raised for the bullfight games. Other than that, there wasn't very much to see. It was interesting to see the different flat countryside.",
          "There was a sci book with the main character out of this area. One can travel backwards or forwards in time in environments like this. So glad I came!",
          "Although not easy or guaranteed to see the horses of the Camargue, when they are spotted, it does make the trip worthwhile, to see these beasts roaming and running freely is a once in a lifetime experience, especially so when you can also see the flamingos . a day well spent",
          "Whenever we can we make a bee line here. Extremely serene place, lovely skies, beautiful white horses, flamingoes, nature. Not spoi!ed by or for tourists.",
          "I was lucky enough to see the pink flamingos, white horses and the black bulls all in few hours spent in this amazing park.",
          "It's a bit of a drive to get there. It's interesting to see the pink flamingos in the area, as well as a salt mine works. We also went to a local ranch and saw the white stallions and the black bulls. We had lunch at the ranch and watched a demonstration of the young men who",
          "We visited in October so the weather was getting a bit chilly and the flamingoes had apparently started their winter migration but we still saw plenty of them as well as horses and bulls. Definitely worth a drive around or quick tour as it's a unique place. Saint Marie de la Mer",
          "it is a specatcular sight ot see the red flamingos and balck bulls, in teh camrgue fileds. Even with a dry seson, the trip was great.",
          "Great surprise to venture out of Arles to see this type of landscape. On the surface it looks like marshy wastelands but the roadside produce stalls, the horses and the wetlands with abundant wildlife all make it such an interesting experience. Go when it is calm and not windy.",
          "We went on one of the half day safari tours in the afternoon and found it a very interesting trip over some quite rough roads at times with lots of wildlife to see. Our tour guide was extremely good and gave us quite a lot of history too, as he works with the horses and bulls in",
          "We took the 4 hour tour of the nature park with a six year old. We should have taken the shorter tour especially with a young child. Interesting to a degree - the tour guide was very knowledgeable and the jeep was fun to ride in with the open top. However, after 3 hours, the",
          "We have decided to rent bikes for a day. Trail lasts 18 km from the city. I believe it is much nicer in the spring. In August lots of places are dried out. Despitr that it was a nice ride with a good rice beerat the mid point.",
          "Nature at it's best! Drive around by car or ride a horse to see the landscape, the sea, pink flamingos, white horses, bulls, and an abundance of birds. They used to film Western movies a hundred years ago. Jack Kennedy and her children went hiding there for a few months after",
          "We went on a jeep tour organized by the tourist office, and our guide/chauffeur Louis was a gem. Clearly loving the area he told us all sorts of stories about the people and he animals. Personally as a Norwegian it was perhaps a bit too flat, the delta between the big and small",
          "We visited the Camargue Nature Park as part of a tour group in the summer month of July. A lot was made of the opportunity to sight (among some 400 species of birds) Flamingo's, close up. I think 99% of the 400 species were enjoying the summer holidays elswhere. At one time, we",
          "As a bird watcher I love visiting this area, although it is the wrong time of year. Too hot and water levels are low to non existent. However, lovely seeing the White horses, Bulls, flamingoes, beeeaters etc.",
          "The Camargue is definitely worth a visit. Nature here is mostly wonderfully untamed and unexploited.The early morning light is absolutely spectacular. Especially where the gorgeous horses graze.",
          "We took a tour and it was well worth it, taking back roads through the carmargue where the horses and bulls are raised as well as vines. The tour included a wine testing. My wife and bought some of the black rice and a bottle of wine.",
          "take an hour or two to amble about, get out of your car lots and take time to enjoy the peace and quiet of this special place",
          "The Camargue is a very interesting region of southern France. In several aspects, it presents a stark contrast with the \"typical\" french landscape, especially because of its several marshes. It is also famous because of its horses and bulls (and rice). The little train ride",
          "A wonderful area which times and times again reveals its many beautiful facets. Under the summer lights, a totally different place, always as interesting",
          "We came here to enjoy the nature. We accidentally overshot our original destination and ended up in the very cool town all the way at the end of the peninsula. We were just in time for the bull herding that was about to happen. The guardians were the horsemen who brought the",
          "Despite what you're told, this is not the Everglades of Europe. You'll drive through a flat area with no view, no good trails, no good availabilty of bikes and really no great places to ride them, no decent establishments or leisure areas. They could do much, much better. The",
          "A unique and stunning natural world, that has been shaped over the centuries by people working together to harness and channel (literally) the forces of nature. We started at La Capeli\u00e8re information centre which had excellent displays about the natural environment, the wildlife",
          "This experience totally surprised us. Very well organized, very educational and such nice people. We ate lunch there and it was very delicious. Be sure to add this to trip if you are in the area.",
          "Loved the diversity of this area , the bull rounding up on horseback, the beaches, the famous white horses , the atmosphere but best of all the bird life including the pink flamingoes . If you can time your visit for their migration there . It is an area I would return to and",
          "Oh what a wonderful place. Really enjoyed our day here. Fantastic creatures--huge bulls, white horses, thousands--and I do mean thousands--of flamingos. Be sure to be on the lookout for birds overhead. When it is flamingos flying overhead, you will be shocked and remember it",
          "The place is quiet, gorgeous and unique. Wonderful wildlife and places to stop and pick up local produce. Easy to drive around too. Very relaxing and interesting.",
          "Difficult to put into words. Exquisite wonderland of nature with exotic birds (flamingos), black bulls and beautiful,white horses roaming within eyeshot.",
          "A beautiful area to visit. We drove through rather quickly, as much of the beachfront was closed, due to very high tides. We did see several groups of flamingos, the wild white horses descended from the horses of Roman times, and, of course, the bulls. Definitely worth a trip.",
          "Took the bus from Arles for only one euro, stops right outside the camargue nature park. Full of interesting birds giving excellent photo opportunities. The bird hospital contained some stunning raptors. Well with a visit. To cover the whole area surrounding the park you need at",
          "Lovely walk around the Camargue Nature Park. Beautiful area and you can get so close to the flamingos. Was great would definitely recommend paying this place a visit!",
          "This natural area is about an hour south of Arles and provides a completely different experience amidst nature and the beautiful white horses native to this region. There are probably tours here from places like Arles, but we had a car. It was an opportunity to visit the sea",
          "We spent several hours exploring the shorter trail, enjoying every minute. The views are beautiful and typical of the Camargue and animals were plentiful. Kids enjoyed the activity booklets which are free and in French. They also loved climbing towers, bridges and various",
          "We were a family of 7 ranging from 80 down to 12 and it was thoroughly enjoyed by all of us. It is beautifully laid out and the flamingos were particularly appealing.",
          "We were pleased to be able to visit the Camargue on a private four hour tour in a jeep with a local guide. There is so much to see I doubt we could have accomplished much on our own by bike or on a riding tour. I imagine it would not be nearly as enjoyable with the summer",
          "We drove through this area twice, each time the coach driver stopping at several points in order to let us take photographs. The landscape, and the wildlife were absolutely stunning, We had heard about flamingos, but to see so many in the wild was breath-taking. In addition, we",
          "Expected to see heaps of flamingos but saw only a few flocks and most too far away to appreciate. The bulls and cows were interesting to learn about, and seeing the storms building their nests and several other bird species could be seen, also. It is a large area to drive around",
          "Quite a different environment - on the surface, quite flat and featureless but very different in many ways - the flamingos of course are unique in Europe, the white horses and bulls are ominpresent. There are also mulitple lagoons that are a festival of birdlife. The towns and",
          "The park is located on the road from Arles to St Maries dela mar. It is bit difficult to find but worth every effort once you get in.The park has thousands of flamingoes. It is quite an experience to see them being fed and fly over your head. There are few swans and other birds.",
          "A very impressive nature is showing up with great animals like wild horses, Pink Flamingos and white swans - a Must See and do - very recomandable",
          "Just a bit out of Arles and you can see this wonderful waterfront village and a great Bird park, ride white horses and view Flamingos and Black Bulls. Just a really cool area.",
          "Booked safari through Arles office of tourisme. Just great. Our guide Jean Louis was very kind and very informative. He made sure we all got the photos we wanted to take. Had a wonderful walk along the Mediterranean at small seaside town.",
          "My husband and I visited the Parc ornithologique de Pont-de-Gau in early February. We thought that since it was early in migration we might see 10 to 20 Greater Flamingos. We were absolutely amazed when we entered the park and were greeted by almost 2000 flamingos. It was an",
          "I was not there for long & m not sure it requires much more time, but just to look through is necessary weather You are travelling around. The landscape is quite unique & also are those nice & sometimes funny flamingos.",
          "It is beautiful and relaxing. Even in January. But they say it's much more beautiful in the summer when birds arrive. In the winter time you can observe the Camargue black bulls though. They breed them for bull-fighting",
          "If you want to get off the stress, just go to the Camargue and let yourself getting spoiled by the nature and the fantastic fresh air. After a few hours everything is falling off and you feel deeply relaxed.",
          "A must-see for nature lovers. The herds of the white horses are beautiful, and seeing the flocks of flamingos is a once-in-a-lifetime for most people. Follow the back roads and just get lost in the peace and quiet.",
          "We only had a quick glimpse of this area and it was fascinating. For France this place is unique, we never saw any place like it anywhere else in the country. It is flat marshland like territory, birds huddle around in the grass, if you're lucky there are wild horses but we",
          "We wanted to get a feel for the Camargue so took the car from Arles to St Maries de la Mer which must be about 60km. It starts as just ordinary cultivated countryside but then changes into the type of scenery which I expected, the long reeds and waterways. There were bird",
          "I never knew a place like this still existed in Europe. The white horses and wild, black bulls were such a surprise. We walked along trails back into the water areas and saw Flamingos wading in the shallows. We felt like we were miles away from anywhere. We felt completely",
          "We crossed on a ferry from Port saint Louis and were then in The Camargue Natural Park and Reserve. We drove for a couple of hours looking for the flamingos and the horses. We were lucky to find a spot where the flamingos were gathered. This was a trip that was very different",
          "We went by bus to Les Stes. Maries de la Mer and had a great view. Then we took a boat along la Petite Rhone.",
          "Frankly, we were disappointed with Arles. We left in the morning and headed back to Montpellier by way of the Camargue. We headed to Salin-de-Giraud, which is a cute, rural village. Just past the village is an overlook of the salt ponds and the huge mountain of dried salt. We",
          "The Camargue is an awe-inspiring place. Saw many flamingoes, a beaver, lots of the Camargue white horses and the black bulls. Even a wild boar crossed the road in front of us. A good pace to explore by car, by bicycle or on foot.",
          "We took a bus trip to the Camargue and found it to be interesting but not what we expected. We thought the horses were still wild but that is not the case. We did see horses, Bulls and in the bird park beautiful flamingos. This is well worth a visit. Not for everyone but",
          "If you are in Arles,make sure you visit Camargue about 25 minutes drive.We really enjoyed the vast natural landscape.We saw thousands of flamingoes but they were not together,many wild white horses,acres of rice paddies ready to be harvested.",
          "We first visited the Camargue many years ago, probably before there was such a thing as a nature park. It was then, and still is, an unusual bit of France, both in its history and visually, and worth a visit. There is now a good museum, very near Arles, that gives an good",
          "We expected lot of wild horses and many birds. There were very few. The sights are nice and tranquil but we did not see much of living animals.",
          "It is difficult to write a meaningful review of anything as vast as the Camargue because it will mean different things to different people.. We are interested in birdwatching and as such our visit proved a little disappointing, perhaps because of the time of year. There are",
          "A nice drive through swamp views , not very special , only few flamingos no horses as expected . Not a must , maybe not suitable in autumn.",
          "We cycled through the Camargue on small roads with nearly any traffic. We were S not disappointed due to the low number of animals we saw. Yes, we saw horses, bulls and flamingo. But it was not as crowded as suspected.",
          "We visited the Camargue in a safari jeep. The guide was multi-lingual, informative and friendly. We saw an abundance of flamingos, white horses and the region's famous cattle. A 45 minute stop at St Marie de la Mer was pleasant and a nice bonus. This was a lovely day, and well",
          "The Camargue is huge and wild. We saw wild horses and flamingos. It is interesting especially if you are nature lover. You really have to be as it is a lot of driving if you drive down both sides of the park. It's vastness is the most interesting part, but it could be rather",
          "This park is amazing. Really completed our south of France trip. I have never seen so many flamingoes, especially in Europe. An unexpected treat. Highly recommend!",
          "We bicycled two days through the park and wish we had two days more. Wonderful birdwatching. We were warned about mosquitoes, but had no problem in early July. The wild horses were well fed and staying quiet in the summer heat.",
          "Well if you love walking along wll maintained pathways and want to experience the Carmague as it truly is then for sure visit here. We went in July and the bird watching was good and flamingos abounded.",
          "Camargue is the name of the nature reserve created by the Rhone river flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. The wildlife there is magnificent. It is one of two places in Europe where the flamingoes breed. The other one is situated in the south of Spain. You can visit the Nature",
          "A must see place, we had a lovely boat trip through the Camargue,and a little staged event where horses and bulls were brought down to the river by the Guardians.It was a very hot day so cover up, also plenty of mosquito's so do take precautions.",
          "We had a short drive through on our way to Nice but it was amazing landscape. There were many bird watchers out there!",
          "We read a lot about this park, people wrote about beautiful and wild horses, pink flamingoes, fantastic nature. Well, we didn't see any of that! We found only four poor thin horses behind the barbed wire, they were hungry and very tired. Also several colonies of flamingoes. And",
          "Fantastic! I was staying in Arles so got the bus for 1 euro through the Carmague to Saintes Marie de la mer and it was a great trip. From there I recommend hiring a bike and cycling through the wetlands. Remember some mosquito repellant though as I got devoured by the things!!!!",
          "Driving through the Camargue, it still seems an unspoilt wetland except for the non stop fake ranch style riding stables. The chances of seeing the wild horses of the Camargue is remote as they seem to have all been tamed into riding ponies. The town of St Maries de la Mer is",
          "This Natural Park of Camargue is located on the Mediterranean, just a few Ks from Marseille Airport .Its mainly between the two arms of the Rhone river. It extends over 3 towns: part of the town of Arles and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the whole town of",
          "Although the images you see of the horses running through the water are hard to find, the Camargue offers other great sights. We have driven around numerous back roads and seen the horses in their natural surroundings, the Bird Park offers a spectacle around 6.30pm when the",
          "Went from Arles to Saintes-Maries de la Mer buy bus and the trip was quite surprising and nice. The park is really wonderful and it deserves a try. Unfortunately we did not have time for a ride in horse.",

          "the last place in Europe where you can see wild horses. A wonderful place of nature in the south of France.",
          "At 30min drive from the city of Arles, right in the middle of the rice fields and just along the Mediterranean coast, this is one of the most beautiful wild spot you could see in France. There you could see plenty of local animals such as the \"Camargue horses\" and the",
          "Week took a morning tour that included a drive through the nature area. It is a worthwhile trip. The Camargue ponies are intriguing and the drive through wetland areas gave us a chance to view flamingoes as well as birds that migrate between the Camargue and Africa. It's good",
          "Browse around Camargue. follow the guardians among the wild bulls and the Camargais horses. It is also the best palce to spot migrating birds. Beautiful!",
          "We had a very nice weather, not crowded beaches and spectacular view on horses and flamingos. We ride a bike along the seashore and enjoyed the view. We recommend this destination for an active rest.",

          "The first half of the walk was really interesting with many wonderful sights and views. You can probably skip the second half--not many different sights, but a long, hot, mosquito-filled walk. Signs are in French but they loaned us an English bird guide. Reasonably priced snack",
          "This expanse of wetlands is a pleasure to drive through, and the ornithological center is fabulous. For a few euros, you can walk through a wetlands and see lots of flamingos, blue herons, egrets and other birds. There are designated paths past large ponds and marshes to see",
          "Great ornithology park, a lot of flamingos. Beautiful landscape with rice fields, white horses, bulls.",
          "What a wonderful part of nature. You can easily see the wild horses, bulla and other wild life without going on organised trips.",
          "The Camargue is surprising and wonderful to visit when the birds are nesting in late May and June. If you want to see them up close then go to the ornothological nature reserve and you can wander for hours and take endless photos of beautiful pink flamingoes plus the occasional",
          "The Camargue is not to be missed by anyone visiting the south of France. Wild white horses, black bulls and pink flamingos. A treat for nature lovers, and it's got the seaside too. We ate some of the best food in France in Arles.",

          "If you have a car (or feel the need to bike around) the Camargue is a great day out. Call into the Mus\u00e9e de la Camargue on the way to Stes Maries de la Mer (Route D570) housed in a beautiful traditional building, also get a map of the area. It looks like there are some great",
          "After a tiring 4 hour car ride, we arrived in the area to see the place and ride the horse. It was a good thing we arrived at 5 pm, rode the horse and saw a beautiful sunset. My family enjoyed it except for the pesky mosquitoes. Bring a LOT of good insect repellent!!!",

          "Nice birds mostly flamings, over 1 hour walking around, a bit hard to find but you can then stay in the nearest nice town.",
          "Not what I expected when we traveled southward to the Camargue. It was flat, scenic and there were many birds along the estuaries. We even went to a \"ranch\" where we met the \"guardians\" who are like cowboys. We saw the prized bulls and the white horses that are unique to this",
          "My absolute favorite journey starts in Saintes Marie de la mer, a nice little village near the sea. For food read my review about PICA PICA. Ideally you have or rent a bicycle. And you'll start your trip on the \"digue de la mer\" in the direction of a light tower, 13 km away.",
          "We ended up spending two days in the Camargue. We were there in January so we had to wear long underwear but there were no mosquitoes. My kids LOVED playing at the beach in Sts. Maries des la Mer (and eating churros and french fries there), loved the flamingos at the Bird Park",
          "Had always wanted to go to the Camargue to see the flamingos,white horses and bulls and although we saw all of that it did not seem as wild as we expected, too many fields of rice. The weather was not too kind to us also which probably didn't help. We went on an organised 4x4",
          "The Camargue is a nature reserve that features white horses and flamingos. If you are visiting make sure you get the ferry across. The local goings on are entertaining with horse treks that come over on the ferry and great coffee at the caf\u00e9 while you wait",

          "We took a day to drive to Nimes and then on to and through the Camargue region which is such a changes from the \"inhabited\" areas of the south of France. We stopped at the National Nature Reserve at la Capeliere which shows interesting cases of information about the botany and",

          "Wanted to see the wild horses roam the salt marshes of the Camargue, along the coastline of south of Arles. There are bulls too, and- surprise for those who did not know -bullfighting. Went off season, but doesn't mean empty. Trail rides give a good perspective, and flamingoes",
          "Lovely views and wildlife. The guide was informative although he didn't speak English. Lots of school trips that time of year. A really good day out but we did get eaten alive so strong repellent is a must!",

          "The Camargue is famous for its wild horses and flamingos, its salt pans and beach. The bird watching is good, but take a hat as the sun can be fierce. We managed to spot about 20 species during the morning's drive. The flamingos and swans were plentiful. During the 1.5km walk we",

          "I was a little disappointed with the trip we took around the Camargue. We did it by coach as part of a fairly large group of tourists and were therefore limited to what we could see from the coach, to where we could stop etc. We did see black bulls, white horses and flamingoes",
          "The park is nice, the villages are full of tourists, lot of souvenir shops and restaurants. The average price of the restaurants was the lowest here in all over Provence during our trip. The beach is sandy, plenty of places, well-equipped with restrooms and baths. The water is",

          "As flat as it gets, but beautiful to see all the wild animals around. We did not see the flamingos, but we did encounter wild cows and White Herons and lots of other birds. Worth the stop in the area of Arles!",
          "Loved the museum. Great section on early cinephotography. Disliked nothing. Les St Mairies de la Mer is a lovely wee seaside town.",

          "The Camargue is a great escape from the bustling life of Arles. The entire park can be explored in little more than half a day even if you take your time. You will see a variety of wildlife to include thousands of flamingos and other sea birds as well as the famous black bulls",
          "The sea, the river delta and Everglade-like marsh land come together to create a haven for exotic wildlife, the Camargue culture and tradition, the Guardians (cowboys), salt beds, fishing and hunting, and the taureau and Chaval Blanc. To see it and understand better the beauty",

          "I had always wanted to visit the Camargue and wasn't disappointed. It covers the huge zone between the two arms of the River Rhone and is shared by the animals, the migratory birds, cereal farms, salt works and a few small towns. We stayed on a Provencal farm (Mas) and spent",

          "I lived in Arles for longtime. The place I loved most was this natural park. Nice horses and touristic stuff but the best is to go there with a car and explore. You can download from Internet a lot of path and sometimes you found yourself in abandoned beach, huge and never",

          "Wild white horses, little bulls, migrating flamingoes, French cowboys (les gardians), and the seaside town of Stes. Maries de la Mer -- what's not to love? This natural park is just beautiful and well worth the drive. I suspect it's a part of France that not too many visitors",

          "We went in a landrover trip for about 3 and a half hours around the area. It is flat and marshy, after a wet winter and spring it was very green and pretty. We saw plenty of flamingos, white Camargue horses (in fields) and Spanish and Camargue Bulls (in fields). It was",
          "Which is so nice to see these days. The flamingoes go to the Camargue to mate, and there are thousands of them. There are many Manards in the area which is where they raise bulls for the bull fighting arenas in Spain.",
          "Before our trip I was reading about the flamingoes only arriving in May. Now I am no expert on the pink bird but we visited on 22 March and must have seen about 500 of them and we did not go to the bird park! The lady at our B&B said we should go to a certain pond where they",

          "I went to the park to see the flamingos and was not disappointed. There were plenty of the birds in ponds a short walk from the entrance. More information in English would have been helpful - or even a basic information sheet. In teh main it was all fairly obvious!",

          "Well maintained trails. Unfortunately, most of the wildlife was gone by the time we arrived there. We did see flamingos and bulls.",
          "The main museum was closed until Nov. although there was a nice hiking trail open. The ornothological park is where I recommend you spend your time! The entrance was tricky to find, we drove past it twice, but the birds are fabulous. Has picnic facilities and a small snack bar.",
          "We cycled through it and found it to be fabulous. The only thing was that from the road leading directly through it there is not much to see. I would advise branching off and definitely trying to take in the visitor centre.",
          "The area is a quick drive from Arles. We went to see flamingos in the wild and the famous white horses and we were not disappointed. Just drive towards Digue de La Mer and stop at the various lookout points along the way. We did not experience any mosquitos as other reviewers",

          "Short trip from Arles and well worth the time. Lovely natural habitat, very scenic. Also, they produce salt which is sold all over France.",
          "We visited in the fall and saw only a few species of birds, but it was interesting to learn about the history and evolution of the camargue to its present state.",
          "The area is spectacular, with vast areas of marshlands and woods. Ideally reached by car as it will enable you to go into narrow roads where public transport does not reach. Book one of the horse riding facilities (there are many) preferably who speak english :) Very cool",
          "What an amazing and unspoilt place this is... follow the road towards Salin, then turn right after Le Sambuc, then pick up the road that skirts the northern edge of the Bassin de Vaccares. See flamingos in flight and on the water, experience the almost eerie calm of the salt",
          "I caught a local bus from Arles, 1 euro 85, to the end of the line near quite an expansive beach.Great spot to cool off in the sea on a hot day. On route through the Camargue Nature Park I saw wild horses grazing knee deep in water. It reminded me a lot of the Everglades in",
          "On a very hot day we ventured forth with fears of mosquitoes etc but although it was very hot we luckily didn't get bitten too much. The landscape is reminiscent of Norfolk but what makes the difference of course is the flamingos. Beautiful birds, best seen in the ornithological",

          "This was a great interesting nature experience. It is very unique because of the evolution of the park itself. We saw lots of flamingoes and two sets of wild white horses. I would say that if one is not a azure lover, as we are, one might be bored. We took the walk from the",
          "We had a great day driving through the Camargue. We saw lots of well fed, healthy horses in many paddocks, many bulls and quite a few flamingos. We saw a large group of flamingos on our drive to Plage de Piemanson. A visit to the town of Salin de Giraud was not worth it, and the",
          "I love the surprising finds on nature trips; and this is one of it. Prior to a trip to Camargue, we extensively covered the other sights within Provence, ie. walking Van Gogh's path, ancient Roman ruins, traditional markets, castles. All the places we covered have been amazing,",
          "Wonderful wildlife in a unique unspoilt region - white horses, black bulls & flamingos. Huge mosquitos so take plenty of repellent!",
          "The Camargue is a natural wilderness area with lots of migratory birds. We saw wild Flamingos in the lakes which was pretty impressive. We didn't like the \"Mistral\" however - a strong wind that blows across the region and whips up the dust. However it is totally unpredictable",
          "always a nice place to visit , especially if you like making photo's about birds and nature and have a good mosquito reppelant. There are also some nice places to enjoy the food like 'Les M\u00e9janes' It is also a must for horse people.",
          "My husband and I did not find the area that exciting. Perhaps it's because we drove by car from Arles to Stes-Maries-de-la-Mer and didn't see anything exciting along the way. We had some stormy, rainy weather but the skies cleared by the time we reached the town. It has an",

          "While staying near Aix-en-Provence, we took several day trips, one being to this interesting and wild area of Mediterranean shores. We saw the bulls, the horses, the birds, but then something very unexpected, naturists! We were driving down the beach, like other cars, heading",
          "We had never heard of wild horses in France. The Camargue Reserve which is the Rhone River delta area is fascinating and our visit there was the highlight of my trip to Arles. We saw the the wild, white horses, the black bulls raised for bullfighting, and hundreds of",

          "The Camargue has so much to offer! It has its own breed of bulls used in the (bloodless) Course Camarguaise bullfights. It has its own breed of horses, born black, but snow white when they are five years old. It's own French cowboys, who herd the bulls from the horses. Its also",
          "We live in the Lincolnshire fens and the Camargue is similar but with horses, and tall grasses. Nice but ordinary.",
          "We travelled to Stes Maries de la mer and used the smaller roads. Great close up views of wild horses, bulls and flamingos, hundreds of them. I think a visit to the camargue museum would improve your experience.",
          "We knew it was not peak birding season - spring or late fall - but decided to go anyway. Listed as a Parc Naturel Regional and a UNESCO Biosphere, the car tour did not give us the experience for which we were hoping....and we drove the entire perimeter of Etang du Vaccares/ Les",
          "Unexpectedly November visit to Camargue was very good, not too hot, not crowded, kind of Indian summer around \u2013 yellow and red leaves. We saw flamingos, white horses, black bulls and plenty of other wild life. There are walking routes around the park, the park office provides",
          "As we were staying further north, we only had one day in the Camargue and spent it divided between the bird sanctuary and the beach. The sanctuary is an excellent venue and you will get your fill of seeing flamingos. Just Gorgeous--got loads of photos. Do both the smaller loop",
          "Well worth a day trip, or even half. Organised through the Tourism office. Very interesting and great to see all the bulls, horses and flamingos.",
          "We returned to the Camargue after 30 years and were not disappointed.The visitors centre at la Capaliere provided us with maps and locations of flamingoes white horses and bulls. Had a quirky lunch at the Mas de Sr Bertrand! Ornotholigal Parc was a dream for my photographer",
          "The Camargues cannot be missed on a trip to Provence. This natural park is something beyond your wildest imagination. Take a bike or good walking shoes and make a day of it",
          "The best was to see the sights we fould was to take a boat trip up the little Rhone, and for an hour and a half, you get great value and see evrything from the bulls and horses to a variety of herons, egrets, and other birds. Fascinating, and without doubt the best way to see",
          "Acres and acres of rice fields and bare ground. A long ,very disappointing and dull drive to see a few Flamingoes in the distance.",
          "Drove down to the shore and took a while before seeing any Flamingoes. They were so far out we didn't immediately realise they were flamingoes, until we got the binoculars out. They were only a small flock too. Saw plenty of white horses though.",
          "Saw hundreds and hundreds of flamingos. Saw the horses everywhere and the bulls. The rice paddies and beautiful scenery.",
          "This is really worth seeing...So beautiful I cannot wait to go back. Do bring anti mosquito products as there are many but it was sincerely an amazing discovery!",
          "Seeing the Camarque fulfilled a childhood dream, having read books about the Camarque horses growing up. We skipped the tours and horse rides, the horses we saw tied up waiting for tourists looked a bit sad and neglected. We own horses at home, and the horse farms reminded me",
          "We spent an afternoon visitng Carmargue Nature Park. This is a wild mashland with horses and bulls and birds and beauty. There are not churches or ruins to visit but it is good for the soul. We found our visit here a relaxing break from our travels.",

          "We cycled round half the park and saw lots of wildlife, including pink flamingos. From a cycling perspective the signposting was poor so you needed a better map than we got from the cycle hire shop. There appeared to be nowhere to obtain refreshments en-route so go prepared with",
          "well you really need to know what you are going to see before you go. study up on the history and the nature of the area and then decide if this excursion is right for you. we went to fulfill a childhood dream of one day seeing those white horses I saw in a documentary at age 7.",

          "Our good friends daughter is going to be a bridesmaid at a wedding in this impressive Abbey currently having some restoration work undertaken. A lovely herb garden in the grounds is well worth a visit and the Auberge we lunched in was amazing.",

          "Founded in 1139 and open to the public since 1975, this abbey is beautiful. Well restored, the gem for me was the cloisters....stunning. The guided tour was interesting, with a lot of information supplied. It was a cold day, so it a bit too long for me. Large parking opposite",

          "We visited the Abbaye on a weekday afternoon in early August. A lovely place and well worth a visit. The Abbaye is in the ownership of a family who are clearly trying hard to restore it after a series of wars, revolution and alternative uses! The main church us quite stunning",
          "We visited the Abbaye for lunch whilst on holiday in the area. After an excellent lunch we explored the Abbaye. I found its history fascinating - not least because of the reason the building survived after the revolution was because it was used to store wine barrels!",

          "The abbey is a pleasant place to wander around and to take in the majesty of a religious order's take on a life of poverty and servitude. We chose to go around by ourselves with the help of an English written guide and the numerous wall plaques. The fountain area was the best",

          "This is a place, a Cistercian abbey, where one can only regret the sad fate of it all. While the building is grand and large in soaring Gothic terms, there is not one stained glass window left of the original and really only one restored example in the restored Refectory. The",

          "We were very lucky as the people were very friendly to us. Since we don't speak French we asked for the English pamphlet so we could read as we walked around. It was founded as an Abbaye in 1138 and after the French Revolution, Valmagne escaped demolition and was sold in 1791",
          "Gorgeous stone and simply amazing masonary. The church is pre-flying buttresses, the ribs holding up the roof are all inside. We did not take the tour. Some of our group went to the restaurant and said it was very good. Those who took the wine tasting option seemed happy enough",

          "This is a lovely place - an old church, gardens, vineyard and organic restaurant. Set in the rolling countryside outside of Pezenas this is a magical place. Driving along you are suddenly confronted by the warm stones of the Abbaye. Walk through the gates and either take the",
          "I had the privilege of getting a guided visit through this fabulous example of French architectural and vinicultural heritage. I was blown away by the majesty of the place! Money well spent for once. Don't forget to grab a bottle of wine. It is organic and made on site. Lovely",
          "Contrary to the experiences of other reviewers here I must say my recent visit was most pleasurable. Yes, the entry charge is probably a bit expensive for what can be a relatively short walk through the old abbey and cloisters. But what an abbey and cloisters they are!",

        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) in January to 24.1 \u00b0C (75.4 \u00b0F) in July. Precipitation is around 630 millimetres (24.8 in), and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221217.8 \u00b0C (\u22120.04 \u00b0F) recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to 43.5 \u00b0C (110.3 \u00b0F) on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nSince 2001, Montpellier has been divided into seven official neighbourhoods, themselves divided into sub-neighbourhoods. Each of them possesses a neighbourhood council.\n\nMontpellier-centre : historical centre (\u00c9cusson), Com\u00e9die, Gares, Faubourg Boutonnet, Saint-Charles, Faubourg Saint-Jaume, Peyrou, Les Arceaux, Figuerolles, Faubourg du Courreau, Gambetta, Cl\u00e9menceau, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, boulevard de Strasbourg, Le Triangle, Polygone, Antigone, Nouveau-Monde, Parc \u00e0 Ballons, Les Aubes, Les Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lazare.\nCroix-d'Argent : avenue de Toulouse, Croix d'Argent, Mas Drevon, Tastavin, Lemasson, Garosud, Mas de Bagn\u00e8res, Mas Nouguier, les Sabines, Lepic, Pas du Loup, Estanove, les Bouisses, Val-de-Crozes, Bagatelle.\nLes C\u00e9vennes : Les C\u00e9vennes, Alco, Le Petit Bard, Pergola, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, Cl\u00e9mentville, Las Reb\u00e8s, La Chamberte, La Martelle, Montpellier-Village, Les Grisettes, Les Gr\u00e8zes.\nMosson : La Mosson, Celleneuve, La Paillade, les Hauts-de-Massane, Le Grand-Mail, Les Tritons.\nH\u00f4pitaux-Facult\u00e9s : Malbosc, Saint-Priest, Eurom\u00e9decine, Zolad, Plan des 4 Seigneurs, H\u00f4pitaux, IUT, P\u00e8re Soulas, Universit\u00e9s, Vert-Bois, Hauts de Boutonnet, Aiguelongue, Justice, Parc zoologique de Lunaret, Agropolis.\nPort-Marianne : La Pompignane, Richter, Mill\u00e9naire, Jacques C\u0153ur, Consuls de Mer, Grammont, Odysseum, Montaub\u00e9rou, La M\u00e9janelle, Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nPr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes : Les Pr\u00e9s d'Ar\u00e8nes, Avenue de Palavas, La Rauze, Tournezy, Saint-Martin, Les Aiguerelles, Pont-Trinquat, Cit\u00e9 Mion.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe whole metropolitan area had a population of 510,400 in 2006. And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

        "brit": "Pont du Gard,  (French: \u201cBridge of the Gard\u201d), giant bridge-aqueduct, a notable ancient Roman engineering work constructed about 19 bc to carry water to the city of N\u00eemes over the Gard River in southern France. Augustus\u2019 son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, is credited with its conception. Three tiers of arches rise to a height of 155 feet (47 m). The first tier is composed of 6 arches, from 51 to 80 feet (15 to 24 m) wide, the largest spanning the river; the second tier is composed of 11 arches of the same dimensions; the third, carrying the conduit, is composed of 35 smaller (15-foot) arches. Like many of the best Roman constructions, it was built without mortar. The structure was severely damaged in the 5th century but was restored in 1743. A highway bridge has since been added to the structure alongside its base.Pont du Gard, N\u00eemes, Fr.Ewing Galloway ",

          "The bridge is something else... Hard to believe it was built by the Romans....still what did they do for us??? I have reviewed the museum separately but the bridge is very cool, a couple of restaurants on the beach side of the bridge. \u2026",

Best spot for a photo in my opinion is from down in the river. Admission is 9.50 euros which includes your parking on the way out.",
          "Absolutely incredible place. 2000 years old and beautifully well kept. An important part of Roman history and a lovely place to come and relax with a picnic. We even saw a light show projected onto the bridge at night which was great",

          "We came around 8pm for the night show in August. Be careful you must arrive by the right side of the bridge which is not really clear. The beach there is huge and clean. Bathing with the view on the bridge is so fantastic. Water is not that \u2026",

          "It is what it says on the tin! The highest aqueduct the Romans built and deservedly popular.  When I first came here entrance was free and you could drive over the contiguous bridge - not anymore! A big visitors' centre new deftly extracts \u2026",
          "Out of this world!  Incredible what they achieved all those centuries ago and it's still standing.  A \"got to\" visit !!",
          "A marvellous historical place to visit and to explore whether you are single or with family. You can spend whole day there and enjoy a river view so natural. Ofcourse a good place to do picnic.",
          "A great of Art. Couldn't believe that this bridge just to get the water from hill to hill",
          "I am sure the Pont du Gard is a great monument( according to photos).\nThe downside is that it is completely guarded off and you have to pay \u20ac 10.- just to look at some old bridge.\nSo we drove off and enjoyed the rest of France.",
          "Very nice place especially at night because you can see the water floating under the Roman waterway and there are lights that are brightening the waterway. A got-to-go place if you are in southern France.",
          "Gorgeous. Worth a visit of a few hours. The museum was OK - but there were issues with the audio-visual not working properly.\nThe bridge - aquaduct is truly amazing.\nIf you have a nice day - take a picnic basket and sit along the grassy banks of the river. Just magnificent.",
          "Amazing piece of history surrounded by beautiful easy walks.\nWorld Heritage",
          "Part of the European History, a unique monument very well kept.",
          "Excellent place to visit in spring and autumn. We went in the middle of summer and the heat was unbearable. No seating under a shade. Long walk from the parking to the site. But overall beautiful place to visit",
          "Brilliant site for all the family. Well organised to preserve the integrity of the bridge. Good food and drink facilities at the entrance and exhibitions and films about the Pont du Gard. Once on the other side of the river, after crossing the bridge, an excellent restaurant and another cafe/snack bar with wonderful views of the Pont.",
          "Wonderful place - if you can come out of the busy season it\u2019s perfect. Take your swimming gear since there\u2019s a spot to swim in the river. Bistro with view on the pont. NOTE: the entrance fee for adults is 9,5 eur; however the GR walking \u2026",
          "This is the perfect place. A lot of places for rest and swimming. Very beautiful aqueduct by Roman age. My recommendation to visit.",
          "Simply breath taking, cannot recommend visiting and viewing this amazing structure enough, also if you go in the summer you can walk the top archway",
          "The place you can relax whole day long, the river is great but you should take special shoes to walk in the water due to stone riverbed. The views are amazing and after sundown Pont du gard is lighten up with all the colors of the rainbow. \u2026",
          "Lovely place, Bridge architecture in itself is marvelous. How a connecting bridge was made next to the canal n is beautiful no doubts...",
          "The history and math behind this aqueduct is amazing. And with access to fresh water, the swimming is really nice as well",
          "Impressive 2000 year old building for water transport to Nimes. Was here in 1974 or 1975 too as child. At that time you could really walk over the bridge. We watched the movie in the museum but besides nice camera work it was not an impressive movie.",
          "Great experience and great views. It's worth a visit if you have the time.",
          "Great place to have a dip in the river and enjoy the sunshine. I recommend hiring a kayak further up stream and then kayaking down with a packed lunch and swimmers ready. Well worth family say out, apparently the the Port di Gard lights up and night (summer time after 22:30). If we had another day i would return and stay longer!",
          "Gotta go and do the full tour before it is closed off for good! Its UNESCO designation will require some changes to the tours to better preserve this incredible landmark. We went on a weekday in the winter and it was practically deserted. Judging by the massive car park, it looks like it would be a complete madhouse in the summertime.",
          "Highly recommended for a whole day stop during the summer. Swimsuit mandatory.",
          "Almost 10\u20ac entrance fee per person. It is not possible to just take a quick look at the monument for free (or low money). We decided not to visit as we considered it to be too expensive for taking a look at an ancient bridge.",
          "Beautiful Place for day trip!!! It has public transport to access till this place from Avignon Station. It takes a bit time but it is worth.",
          "Am absolute Must-See if you're interested in Roman history. A fascinating museum with extraordinary exhibits.  Go.",
          "I was lucky to see this 40 years ago when there was just the structure itself and you could go out and walk along the top. The wonder of it is now somewhat crushed by the weight of tourist infrastructure, 50 foot wide concrete paths, numerous cafes etc and by the sheer number of visitors.",
          "What an awesome history lesson. I was there in 2012. Pease look up the aquiducts of California and compare photos. I'm sure there are aquiducts all over the world. The Romans were so resourceful.",
          "Pont du Gard is definitely worth of visiting even, if you are not a fun of history. Absolutely fantastic ancient Roman aqueduct standing solidly on the rock basis for more than 2000 years. Don\u00b4t forget to take your swimming dress and swim under the bridge.",
          "Absolutely stunning. A beautiful work of architecture from the Roman age crossing the river near Nimes. Definitely a must see if you are in this area.",
          "A lot bigger than you might think. Easy to walk around and parking space available very well.",
          "This is your standard tourist trap, pay parking, pay to get in the gate. Not exactly cheap but I'm guessing it costs to maintain the site. Parking is good plenty of space then about a 5 min walk to the entrance. Nice little cafe / ice cream shop on the inside. Kids and adults can swim in the river. I'd still say it's worth seeing.",
          "Unmissable monument in the area!  You can walk up to both sides of the aqueduct and down into the river.  Cafe and restaurant are a little pricey so be prepared to pay or bring your own refreshments.",
          "Not bad, but I felt It was expensive for what you can see. At least they could have removed some trees for better view.",
          "This demonstrates exactly what the Romans did for us.  The museum is cleverly done but a little too dark for me to read some of the notices without a struggle",
          "Beautiful. Good for a swim in summer, and a real feature of the area.",
          "Breathtaking monument. Great place to have a dip In the Gard. Beware of the holiday canoeists they're like their Sunday driver counterparts...",
          "A cool place with a beautiful view. I found the museum not too interesting for me but others I travelled with really enjoyed it. We had a picnic below the near the aqueduct and that was a great experience. I would definitely recommend to \u2026",
          "A site worth taking the time to see if you are in the area. The cafe on the path is not worth the time or expense. The museum is informative and interesting; we particularly enjoyed the children's area.",
          "Very impressive and would highly recommend a visit. A very peaceful site",
          "This is an amazing relic. The hiking is easy and the aqueduct is beautiful.",
          "Such a sense of history. Recommend seeing the museum first and then visit the viaduc. Will be back for a swim.",
          "Awe inspiring. Do not miss this stop in southern France. Went in early March and the weather, even at sunset was wonderful and the light was incredible. Good orientation movie. Student discount tickets with ID. Helpful staff.",
          "Went stand up paddle boarding under the bridge. Very nice experience, besides a lot of tourist and kayakers. That was the only negative aspect. But it was high season.",
          "A real must see, while in France. Take the tour, they explain so much of the history. Make sure you put aside at least a couple hours so you can enjoy it all and see everything. The bath on the other sidenof the river. The very top is to \u2026",
          "Nice place and if you are around why not to see it. Entrance for 9,50 and children up to 12 free entrance. You can swim in the river which is clean have a picnic or just walk around.",
          "Was going to skip this thinking it was just an aqueduct. Glad I didn't because it's not just the architecture. It's a national park and is just splendid. Views, atmosphere, the relaxing surroundings...until all the school kids came and ruined the peace...\n\nLots of tourists.",
          "If you are going provence, this is one of the must! Great for kids as well, there's great experience oriented museum for kids!",
          "Fabulous piece of history,2000 years ago the Romans built this amazing construction in just 5 years",
          "Happend to be nearby in Uzes, and got there after the right bank visitor entrance was closed. Followed the signs to the left side, where there was a wine tasting event. Great evening watching the sunset over the bridge. Staggering.",
          "Wonderful place to visit when in the local area. The Easter festival they have is definitely worth a visit. A very famous French monument. Normally one of the hottest places in France.\n\nMany people bring picnics to and spend the day here. \u2026",
          "Takes your breath away. Monumental, in perfect light. Be sure to go to the museum, too.",
          "Amazing place. Incradible structure build by the Romans. Spectacular.",
          "A worthwhile visit plenty of different walks around the site,you can take a picnic inside and also swim in the river they have good facilities and easy access for people with reduced mobility and amazing bridge from another time there are also some old Olive trees from long long time ago from a land not so far away",
          "Beautiful place. Well worth the visit, remember however to research which side to park on, one is closer to the bridge than the other.",
          "Stunning Roman Aquaduct. Costs \u20ac9 per person but if you follow a walking trail you cam avoid the cost. Turn right before the main entrance and walk through the Olive groves. Use Google earth to navigate.",
          "Lovely place I really high recommend",
          "Beautiful and powerful at the same time. Excellent river to cool off on a hot day. Great facilities and bathrooms as well.",
          "Excellent facilities with lots of parking and nice flat paths suitable for all to access. The Pont du Gard it's self is incredible and well worth a visit. The cafe offers good food at reasonable prices.",
          "Spectacular, high and long.  Must see.  Beautiful setting.",
          "Impressive work by Roman long long time ago. Nice work and museum. Make sure you prepare 2-3hrs I\u2019d you intend to check out museum on site.",
          "Very spectacular both in location and construction. Much better though if the Mistral is not howling. Best to park on Rive Gauche, where the museum is located. Best lookout point on Rive Droite.",
          "What an amazing experience. Awe inspiring. Highly recommended",
          "A beautifully preserved Roman aqueduct with an interesting museum and a beautiful river, lovely to go kayaking on or diving off high stone banks or a refreshing swim in the summer. I'll make sure I come back again!",
          "Must see in this region. Really impressive and if the weather is good, do not forget swimming gear.",
          "A must see in the southern region. Don\u2019t forget to bring your swimming trunks, you can actually take a bath in the river just under Pont du Gard. Essentially a good place for a walk in the nature.",
          "Amazing place and make sure you get your swimming wear with you if it's summer time. It was an awesome experience. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude1c",
          "Very pretty. Make sure to check out the vegetation parcour. Also bring a swimsuit, you can swim/kayak in the river under the aqueduct.",
          "Amazing architecture and beautiful views.\n\nIf you have time, bring a swimsuit for the river. Visit the aqua ducts first thing to avoid the heat, then see the museum as the day heats up.",
          "This bridge just puts life into perspective seeing how old it is. So phenomenal and recommend walking up to a viewpoint to see the bridge.",
          "Really an amazing structure to behold, especially since it was constructed around 40-60AD and took 15 years to build. When you see how large the bridge / aqueduct is, and realize that it was built with ropes, pulleys and a lot of sweat, it \u2026",
          "Fantastic. The bridge is set in a park, so you pay an entry fee, around \u20ac9 for the whole area, including river where people were swimming and picnicking. The aquaduct itself is awesome. So huge and intact. The museum is also very informative and well laid out, nd the cinema shows a great film about the aquaduct.",
          "I went back in the early 2000's and the structure itself is amazing, but time has not been kind to the beurocratic mess that is admissions. Think if they treated this amazing piece of Roman engineering like a ride at Disneyland. Maybe it's better if you go with a guided tour group?",
          "Fantastic place! If you have a chance to see it, you should!",
          "Just sensational. An out of this world experience and a chance to cool off with a swim on a blisteringly hot day",
          "This place is so magical that I can not explain it. I was working near Marseille for two years and this was one of my favourite places. I was here multiple times ... Perfect place to go for a date, watch sunset or just chill out or walk. If \u2026",
          "Truly awesome, anything that I could write would pale in relation to this wonderful survivor of the ages",
          "Proposed to my wife here 14 June 2001.  Anything that stands for 2 millennia, and is the largest Military structure constructed by a Roman Legion gives the permanence to my proposal I was looking for as a 25 year vet myself.    May it stand forever",
          "Beautiful structure in beautiful natural setting. You can eat at the bistro on the right bank, watch the light show at night, our picnic by the river's edge during the day",
          "I think the pont du Gard is an amazing monument, breathtaking to see. I recommend bringing your swimming trunks to have a swim in the river underneath.",
          "The bridge is worth but be aware that the parking is a rip off. In fact, the access to the bridge is free of charge (by wall or bike), but they ask you 9.50 EUR/person to access the parking and museum. Just drop your family and friends \u2026",
          "Where else can you be impressed by 200 year old graffiti on a 2000 year old structure ? To make a complete day, I suggest booking a canoe trip.",
          "The palace is amazing. A 2000 year old Aquaductus, nice river. Very big areal, bring some time and swimwear.",

          "Majestic, for a almost 2000 years old architectural wonder",
          "Great place to visit. I totally recommend this aqueduct which was built by the Romana more than 2000 years ago! You can spend here half a day easily and the restaurants are decent",
          "Absolutely wonderful. Amazing to be able to see and touch something so old and well kept.",
          "Check it out. Pretty cool. Don't need more than an hour here.",
          "A truly breathtaking experience. It really is one of those sights that you need to experience personally to fully comprehend the scale of the aquaduct. Like the Colosseum and the Eiffel tower the photos do not do them justice. An extremely \u2026",
          "Lovely relaxing walk around the site of the Pont du Gard.  Would be nice for a picnic",
          "Hairy Bikers visit inspired me to go. Not disappointed, an amazing place. Very very hot when I went but a beautiful clear clean fresh water river to bath in so bring your swimming stuff!

          "Great spot well worth a visit",
          "Quite impressive place. You could walk on this historical bridge for free (lower level) or pay and get experience of walking high (ticketed). In summer don\u2019t forget swimmers! The river is clean and warm. Go behind the bridge to find a few nice beaches which are also good for kids",
          "Nice place to visit, have a picnic, ride your bicycle.",
          "Stunning Roman construction and a beautiful setting. A swim under the central arch is essential.",
          "Iconic must-see when in the Avignon area. 10 Euro entry includes museum visit with informative multimedia presentation to help you appreciate the work that went into buiding this very important structure. The aquaduct is surrounded by lots of park space, perdect for strolling, running, biking, or a dip into the waters. Amazing!",
          "Beautiful not only the bridge but also the surroundings. NO NEED TO PAY TO VISIT IT if you enter by foot or bike through the walk path beside the Rive Droit parking. Park for free at 2km in Remoulins",

          "Beautiful and very impressive.",
          "Although we live only 30 min from Remoulins, we go there at least once a year with friends and family. In summer one can swim in the river, kayak, enjoy the view and learn something in the museum.",
          "Impressive\nVery impressive.",
          "Beautiful and exciting! Just a shame it is not allowed to walk on it unless you are with a guide in a big group... also the museum is clear and educational!",

          "Amazing structure and history. Popular swimming spot that was great to go to too.",
          "Spectacular.  Interesting museum on site but VERY dimly lit and therefore not recommended for the elderly.  Beautiful trees close to bridge.",
          "Wow! What a place. This epic feat of engineering rises above a beautiful landscape right out of a painting. I read about this place when I got into the Romans in high school. It was fantastic to see it in person. I highly recommend the tour \u2026",
          "Really nice for wild swimming. It\u2019s about 10euros per person when you park in the car park",
          "More than just a bridge!  This is an amazing example of Roman engineering at its best.  It has survived for nearly two thousand years and is still standing.  The museum is an excellent example of a good exhibition in the way only the French \u2026",

          "Nice but very refreshing swimming near the bridge. Rather crowded but hey, it's a major tourist attraction, what do you expect...",
          "To visit this milestone of Roman architecture, plan enough time. There are many views to explore, from almost to the top of the aqueduct (the upper most part is only available with a guided tour) down to the river banks. Well prepared paths \u2026",
          "Marvel at precision Roman engineering 2000yrs ago.\nTouch it and feel the ancient on your hands.\nJust amazing.\nMuseum us very cool too. Check out how they made pipes (ok nobody knew about the effects of lead), very impressive.",

          "Great place, for someone who likes history like me it can be one of the best historical site",
          "Impressive to see the 2000 years old building still standing there in full beauty. You can also take a bath on the southern river bank. Many tourists but all well organized. Prices are high but thinking that they use the money to take care \u2026",
          "Those Romans knew a good swimming hole when they saw one",
          "Phenomenal views and history. No too many tourists at this time of year. Bike in and it is free.",

          "A beautiful and breathtaking technological marvel from the roman era with spectacular views of the valley and river. If you go on a hot day, take your swimming costume. The water is lovely. Our only regret is we didn't turn up earlier and take a kayak down the river.",

          "How can you not like something that still looks this good after being built 1958 years ago? It wasn't over crowded, and it's a great place to go for a swim too. The grounds are well kept too. The tickets are a good value if fully utilized and they are discounted in the evening.",
          "Came down by kayak from Collias. Had picnic on riverside. Lots of birdlife. The aquaduct is well worth a visit. Picked up by van 2.5 kms below pont and brought back to carpark at Canoe Collias. Just let them know when you want picked up again. Total distance by kayak=7 kms.",

          "Amazing feat of Roman engineering from the first century.",
          "An architectural marvel! The museum at the visitors center was an in-depth look at the work that went into the aqueduct and helped me appreciate it more. Loved that it was open so late in the summer. Sitting on the banks of the river next to wild thyme watching the sun set with the Pont in the background was magical!",

          "Was lucky enough to visit on a night when there was a great light show with animated images projected onto the bridge  with accompanying music. Amazing. I don't know where to find dates for these shows but worth investigating if you're planning a visit.",
          "Very impressive. It's possible to swim here. Parking included in entrance ticket (9.50 eur).",
          "You think an aqueduct is nothing special? Think again! This is the tallest Roman bridge-aqueduct in the world, standing at 48m high, which dates back to the beginning of the Common Era (50 AD). When you see it all you can thi k about is: how did they build it 2000 years ago???",
          "Incredible architecture and absolutely stunning to see lit up at night. We had dinner at the nearby restaurant  with the Pont du Gard looming behind us. Wonderful experience!\n\nI think parking was like $10 with a short walk to the aqueduct.",
          "Such a depth of history to this place. Built in 1st century and still standing strong.",
          "**It is free to visit the bridge**. Don\u2019t pay \u20ac9 per person for parking (and access to a museum). Park for free at one of the two towns close by and walk to the bridge along one of the numerous walking paths.",
          "Good afternoon trip, there are a few places to buy and enjoy refreshments. The main attraction is obviously the Roman aqueduct, it is well worth the trip you get to go up really close to it, even touch it in a few places if you want. Additionally there are a lot of good vantage points to take good pictures or just enjoy the view",
          "Stunning place to visit. Nice walk in the shade of the trees and beautiful views over the Gardon from the aqueduct. Caf\u00e9s, restaurants, toilets on both banks but swimming in the river only on the right bank (Rive droite) but is accessible \u2026",
          "Great place a lot more to see than just th aqueduct.",
          "Well-preserved and grand monument of Roman engineering.",
          "We stopped in here along a trip, but decided not to visit the aquaduct after we saw how long the lines were to get ticket. We ate our packed lunch with our kids then left, expecting to pay for parking because we had been been in the parking \u2026",
          "Amazing structure and so well organized for entry.  Bring swim suits if the weather allows and stay for the evening light show!",
          "Loved Pont du Gard. Amazing structure. Loved swimming under the bridge, essential when the temp is 44\u00b0C!!!",
          "Absolut sehenswert. One of the things you have to see before you die.",
          "The girls enjoyed the quick dip in the water after a long hot drive and before heading back home... and what a view for a pitstop :-)",
          "Beautiful place. If it's hot bring your swimmers!",
          "Amazing place and a great museum too! Don't forget your swimsuits!!",
          "An amazing space with an ancient Roman aqueduct spanning the river. One of our favorite places!",
          "What an amazing place. Roman aqueduct in great condition.  You can swim from either bank of the river, too.  We arrived after closing so could not go on top but still we're able to visit the site and take great pictures.  If you want to see authentic Roman architecture this one cannot be missed.",
          "We came to visit the world-renowned historical site on a rainy day since it was our last day in Avignon. We were very happy we did, for we had a private guided tour with another couple from Germany.  One of them was an American too. The \u2026",
          "Must see, impressive monument. The museum is also brilliant.",
          "Amazing 0lace to visit if you are in the area... worth \u20ac9.50",
          "Spectacular barely describes  it. We came by bus from Nimes.",
          "Interesting. Fleshed out a bit tho.",
          "wonderful place worth visiting",
          "A must go if you\u2019re visiting Avignon. Good trails.",
          "Always a pleasure!! Splendid site",
          "Great historical site!\nCrowds are reasonable in early May.\nMuseum is very interesting.",
          "Lovely place, river ideal for swimming and jumping into water, unfotunatelly have to pay for this",
          "Wow, to be able to cross the bridge and climb up to see the top of this ancient structure is mind blowing!! Another MUST see!",
          "The Pont du Gard is a brilliant feat of roman engineering the top part of which forming part of an aqueduct bringing water tomo the city of nimes from Uzes nearly 30 miles up in the north. There is an excellent visitors centre and an audio \u2026",
          "Must see if visiting the area. 9.50 euro entrance fee more than justified to help preserve such an important monument.",
          "Stunning view, well worth a visit, a bit of a walk over uneven ground",
          "The museums are really well done and super interesting! There is a nice part for kids to learn by playing. Really liked it!",
          "Really stunning aqueduct and surroundings.",
          "Historical place that makes you say Wow! For those who admire medieval architecture will be amazed. The size and design that remained till now?! Great masterpiece of Roman culture, worth a visit and time spent there. Just find a quiet spot to admire the view, or hike towards it. C\u2019est superb!",
          "It was one of place I didn't know.  A friend took us there.  We didn't get to see everything expect to spend the whole day and the restaurant there was formal dining the outside isn't.  But was to windy and cold for the present companies.  I took away two star because of this.",
          "What the Romans did!",
          "When we arrived at the gates we were at first dissuaded by the commercial set up and price of the parking to enter. Although we read online that it\u2019s possible to park in the nearby village and walk along the river to reach the bridge we \u2026",
          "Entrance should be cheaper / free. Cool place though.",
          "Loved visiting here. Definitely one of the highlights of my stay in France. The view is really amazing. Hiked up to take a panorama and forgot to take it because it was so amazing to see everything. I definitely recommend making a stop here.",
          "Such an amazing Place. I recommend it.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, also with kids. There is so much in the Museum that kids will love as all is almost interactive!",
          "Place is very beautiful there is a river in the middle and the bridge is simply stunning. Is very interesting and everything is child-friendly and wheelchair friendly. You can even bathe in the river or do some canoe. It's very popular place especially in summer",
          "Definitely go there. An outstanding piece of Roman engineering.",
          "Lovely place. Too many people peak season for my liking,  using the river,  beaches, etc. But great for families. Museum is very good (although a bit dark). Phone ahead to book a 3rd tier (top) tour, as they are fully booked early",
          "Vraiment une etape a faire en Provence...a must see near Nimes this architectural treasure from the Roman era is impressive..the site is well organized for crowd management..a lovely cafe on the river as well..",
          "Perfect place for those interested in Roman history and engineering. I was on a guided tour so I didn't spend the time I would have liked in the excellent museum or was able to explore the site fully.\nOne criticism is that some of the \u2026",
          "Quite interesting trip! You can walk by yourself where you want or you also can choose a guided tour. Very relaxing place with river and wood. We enjoyed it.",
          "Amazing engineering by the Romans.. picturesque well worth seeing",
          "Beautiful, relaxing place. Take your time to explore the surrounding area and you can also swim in the river, in front of this magnificent aqueduct.",
          "Breathtaking views, a real architectural treat. A truly fantastic place to visit. We went in early April so it was quiet and less tourists are there. But in a lovely day the bridge and the views blew us away.",
          "OK but good have more Fortnite and food, i did get pretty hungry",
          "Breath taking!!! The water is amazing as well.",
          "Very nice view. Easy to access.",
          "This was on my \"must see\" list as I cycled around Europe. I was not disappointed. An absolutely stunning piece of engineering in a beautiful location. Do give yourself some time to spend here as there is much to see and it is a wonderful place to relax.",
          "People have said it's extremely expensive. We came in the evening and it was only 12 euro for 5 people which felt reasonable. The bridge is a must see if you're in the area, and there's a great swimming spot under it so if the weather is nice bring swimwear and a towel!! 4 stars for the price.",
          "Unbelieveable what they have build and could build in history",
          "Didn't go to the official place where you walked over.. but did find a canoeing trip where you went under. River was easy... Fantastic to see ... made us feel so insignificant to think it has been around so long.",
          "Very beautiful Aqueduct. Do not forget to bring swimming clothes to have a nice swim in the river.",
          "Worth visiting. Bring your bathing suit!",
          "9.5eur per adult for the entrance... does not worth. Unesco sites should be free",
          "Nice moment to be spent in front of a magnificent 2000 years-old Roman construction.",
          "Impressive aqueduct that is extremely well maintained. Area is nice for kayaking and swimming, although it's a stone beach. Take a look at the museum when you're there, it gives a lot of interesting info about the history of the site and Roman aqueducts in general.",
          "Amazing atmosphere, stunning view. A place to visit definitely!",
          "Nice - plan ahead and take something to swim with",
          "Absolutely beautiful loved it.",
          "Beautiful place, scenic views with major history, the museum was amazing and unexpected with all the engineering involved in producing this beautiful structure and transporting water to Nimes!! For the ladies, skirts and dresses are best \u2026",
          "Brilliant day out. Very interesting. Bring a picnic and you swimming gear and jump in the water to keep cool. Really lovely views from the top and worth a tour for the views.",
          "One of the greatest achievements of Ancient Rome.",
          "Amazing old aqueduct with beautiful surroundings.",
          "I was very impressed. Well organised parking a lot of it in the shade. Buying tickets was simple, you can buy them in advance if you want. There is a large seating area in the shade to eat at and a very well run shop to buy food and drinks \u2026",
          "Amazing and the museum explaining the structure of the aqueduct  and importance of water in Ancient Rome is excellent",
          "Definitely recommend spending the time to visit if you are in the area. The monument is spectacular and there are many walks and trails on both sides of the river that allow you to get many great views. The visitors centre and museum is quite new and very informative.",
          "Spectacular, even more so on an evening",
          "Remarkable monument. Great museum too!",
          "Kayak trip.. excellent.give it a go.",
          "Highly recommend hiking in. Beautiful walk and stunning place for a picnic.",
          "The spot is nice and the entrance ticket includes parking, which is always nice.\n\nBe warned though: guided tours might finish early and you won't know unless you call in advance or go there. We suggested they add the info on their website, \u2026",
          "Holy cow. This may have been my favorite place in France-or anywhere for that matter. When we went, the sun was setting and we were one of the only people there. It was one of the most beautiful views i\u2019ve seen and I felt like we had the whole place (including the river) to ourselves. I\u2019d highly recommend!",
          "5 stars are not enough, absolutely breath taking",
          "2000 years old bridge in a pristine condition.",
          "Bring swimming clothes with You and enjoy  the Roman acquedotto",
          "Human genius at the service of the Pax Romana...",
          "Awe inspiring and in a beautiful location on the river. Lots of paths through the gardens and up to different view points.",
          "Very interesting historical landmark. There is nice information in the welcome center but the tour can take a while to wait for and all you do is walk through it. I would recommend just going and parking on the other side of the river, \u2026",
          "Tourist trap, crowded place, 9,5 \u20ac entrance. It's nice but doesn't worth for it.",
          "An iconic landmark that attracts a lot of visitors the site is large enough to cope without feeling overcrowded. There is a great museum on site along with cafes and gift shops. If you are in the area you should visit.",
          "Breath taking what the Romans could build so long ago. It must have inspired awe in all those that saw this. Definitely worth seeing. Bring a picnic, lots of beautiful grass to sit and lay about on.",
          "Amazing bridge. Expensive entry but good museum",
          "Amazing structure. The new museum and cafe are a very good addition. The sprays of water to help cool you down were much appreciated as it was so hot at the end of July.",
          "Incredible architectural monument, and engineering marvel...some parts are 2000 years old",
          "I was quite disappointed... 9,50\u20ac entrance fee and it seems more of an attraction parc than a UNESCO site, with everybody coming to bath in the river, putting loud music etc. Not quite the atmospherr you expect...",
          "What an amazing piece of Roman architecture. Completely stunning. You turn the corner and are amazed. Nice 10 minute walk from entrance. Can walk down to the river for best pictures.",
          "Impressive roman aqueduct and very well laid out museum.",
          "Some very historical place with amazing roman architecture... You must visit..",
          "Mind-bogglingly huge and well preserved.  Not the most exciting thing to do, so wear your swimsuits and pack a lunch to make it more fun.  The river is beautiful and the setting pleasant.",
          "Awesome spectacle de lumiere!!",
          "Amazing that it could last so long",
          "Classic. Must see!\nRoman aquaduct in a beatiful place of the river Gard valley.",
          "Totally worth the money! Not sure what people are complaining about!!  Didn't talk much to the employees, so not sure how \"rude\" they were per other reviews..money well spent at the end if the day.",
          "One of the good example how world known sighs can be. Good parking situation, nice open area to walk and explore. Feels more like a big park with that old beautiful aqueduct as a masterpiece.",
          "Magnificent example of Roman engineering, very well preserved. The area is also beautiful with many other parts of the water supply system that can be followed from both sides of the aqueduct.",
          "Nice place to have a walk",
          "It\u2019s just as amazing in the rain.",
          "Not only a beautiful historical structure, but an amazing and thorough museum with tons of information about the Roman building techniques and life. Plus, it's an amazing park with lits of trails, swimming and walking areas. And not to forget, the fabulous and delicious restaurant on site!",
          "Amazing piece of history. Worth the visit",
          "This part of an aquaduct built by the Romans is massive and impressive. It is one of the must-see things here I think. It is paid (eur 9.50 per person at the time of writing, which includes parking). Ignore the shops at the start and just \u2026",
          "Great experience. Booked the guided tour through the aquaduct... Worth every cent. Friendly, helpful workers.",
          "The pont du Gard is a very nice architectural structure. It\u2019s just sad that it is so monetized and you can\u2019t just see the bridge from the outside without paying the full price of 9,50 euros per person.",
          "Huge, tall aqueduct - very impressive! Need at least 2 hours to appreciate. Limited A15 bus times to the aqueduct.",
          "A marvellous historic site",
          "An easy, undulating trail walk. Really enjoyed the views! A dip in the river on a hot August summer's day....very refreshing!",
          "Came back here for a reason. It is amazing.",
          "Brilliant historical site. Well worth the visit for both the walk and the museum.",
          "Superbe Views, good infrastructure, Nice museum",
          "What can words say.. Try swimming under the acqeduct, or visit the very good museum. There is a good restaurant and a bistro on the right bank. Look at their website, best to buy tickets online in high season, the queue at the desk can be HUGE.",
          "Merine",
          "One of the nieces places to visit. There is a very nice beach and a great place to have a picnic and have a dip in the river. Just before that there is nice view from all around.",
          "Very Nice place to visit",
          "What an amazing experience! Stunning! Take time to spend the whole day. Visit the museum, the kids section is great too. The restaurant on the other side to the pont is good, we sat on the patio with a beautiful view of the river and pont. \u2026",
          "Simply stunning engineering and restoration project. World class heritage site and best on site museum/visitor centre I've been to.",
          "A great place to visit with a nice museum to understand better.",
          "Interesting for lovers of ancient history. There is a lot of walking involved, some on very bumpy ground.",
          "Stunning piece by of Roman architecture in a beautiful setting. Well worth a visit. Well presented visitor centre, with refreshments available. Ample parking.",
          "You cannot understand the immense public works the Romans did without visiting their sites. It seemed expensive at 9E but was well worth it.",
          "A full day or more is needed here to really enjoy what they have created here. Is very unique and the kids can roam....its safe...",
          "The view is amazing, the aqueduct is extremely well preserved.  Not much else to see around. There are trails you can walk to get a better view of the bridge.",
          "Great backdrop for a fantastic swim in the Gardon",
          "I am sure it's great.  But beware it's 8.50 Euros to get in. There is no way of seeing it without paying.( I suppose you might be able to get to it by boat )",
          "I was reluctant going here but after visiting here with two small kids (ages 9 and 5) I must admit that this is a must see attraction. The combination of the river with all the green and the amazing Roman aqaduct were realy amazing. Keep in \u2026",
          "Very nice place to spend the day. If coming in the summer. There's a river to swim sunbathe and do many other things. \nThe aqueduct is very well preserved and although it is not free entrance for a small fee you get to see a movie plus \u2026",
          "Delightful afternoon outing. The bridge itself is simply awesome but the area has been made into a riverside park. The museum at the entrance adds some context to its history and construction.",
          "Amazing place, full of history - well worth visiting.",
          "This is an incredible site and definitely worth a visit. Give yourself enough time to see it from different angles and relax by the river for a little bit. Make sure you also take a guided tour through the channel on the top level to really appreciate it!",
          "Absolutely stunning piece of architecture",
          "Book in advance if you want a tour of the third tier, other than that lovely place, lots of space along side the river to sit and swim in the river. Food and drink as always is expensive, so best to bring your own.",
          "This is very hard to review... on the one hand, the bridge is beautiful and definitely worth seeing. On the other, just driving into the car park will cost you \u20ac18, which I was absolutely livid about. I literally just wanted to jump out and \u2026",
          "Absolutely awesome! Totally exceeded my expectations. Be sure to pack swim stuff as the river is a popular, beautiful, and unique place to take a dip.",
          "The ancient knew how to build. Nice lights show. And cool water on a very hot day!",
          "Built in the 1st century AD by the Romans, this amazingly well preserved aqueduct carried water to fill the fountains and baths of Nemausus (modern day N\u00eemes in southern France). Well worth a visit!",
          "Nice place,\nnice swimming location",
          "Beautiful place. We walked on and around for about 2 hours.",
          "Excellent visit! Enormous. 5 times better than Avignon bridge. And free! Don't pay for parking, there is space on the offroads before reaching the gates.",
          "Great museum. The aqueduct illumination after sunset is spectacular - don't miss it. No need to pay the entrance fee unless you want to visit the museum.",
          "The aquaduct is amazing, the cafe and restaurant very good and lots of places for picnics. The children enjoyed a paddle in the water. A fun day out.",
          "An amazing Roman aqueduct. Well worth a visit. A history lesson much appreciated. There\u2019s a museum well worth a visit.\nYes I\u2019d go back again!",
          "No way to adequately describe or photograph how incredible this is. Hand-cut stone (no power tools!), and NO cement or mortar. Really nice park, encourages family use, museum...",
          "An interesting piece of history located in a very scenic area.  I didn't have a lot of time here but I would have loved to stay for kayaking, swimming,  or hiking as so many others did. \n\nThere are signs pointing to vantage points with nice views, however the path is not well marked. ",
          "Built more than  2000 years ago.  A jewel of the roman engineering.",
          "A beautiful and extensive aqueduct built in Roman times. This is a well set up attraction with museum, guided tours (stairs involved) , restaurants and park/picnic areas. Best visited by car but also accessible by inexpensive public transport from Nimes (be careful of the weekend bus timetable as frequency and stops change).",
          "Lovely palace for family day out",
          "The Roman aqueducts were fascinating, but this is the best. Our tour let us cross it inside the actual canal, high atop the beautiful structures. A bit claustrophobic for some, but worth whatever to get to the opposite side. Lots of trails \u2026",
          "Fantastic place to visit. Excellent big car park, good visitor centre, toilets, gift shop and exhibition. Video film was aimed at children.",
          "Great site in a relaxing atmosphere. Very interesting museum.",
          "Lots of people on Saturday! Be prepared...",
          "The Pont du Gard was one of the most beautiful landmarks I have ever visited! It looks great overlooking the river and the greenery surrounding it made the view look even better. It is amazing how such an old structure has lasted for over \u2026",
          "Free entry if you follow the cycle route through the official car park. Park nearby and walk to the bridge...it's amazing. Well preserved monument in stunning surroundings. You can walk or cycle across and admire it from either bank of the river.",
          "Very amazing to see and experience such an old piece of history. You can walk down to the lake and view the bridge from the bottom. Or follow the trecks up to the view points. The museum wasn\u2019t very impressive, disappointing that everything \u2026",
          "Amazing experience and beautiful views.",
          "The Pont du Gard itself is amazing, but the management of the place is not so great. If you just want to visit the bridge it\u2019s free. But at information center they made as buy ticket for museum etc without even mentioning that the bridge was free to visit. We couldn\u2019t find the directions to museum once we are at the bridge.",
          "Great place to visit and explore. Even swim.",
          "Beautiful pictures we took there. Very interesting museum. Don't miss it \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Despite seeing pictures beforehand, I really enjoyed visiting the monument as well as chilling by the water. Highly recommend it!",
          "A good place to stop. The museum and indoor spaces are huge and provide a great display. Good cafes and facilities. Easy walk to the river. and a great insight into the Roman history of the region.",
          "Beautiful and elegant ancient architecture.",
          "Beautiful world heritage site.",
          "Wow!! The tallest aqueduct!! Excellent museum, worth the euros and your time!!",
          "What an amazing piece of history!",
          "Beautiful! Absolutely mind blowing place! Crystal clear, warm river water. \nIf you do a kayaking adventure, be sure to use Canoe Collias, what a superb group of people.\nWe learned many lessons kayaking down the river; 1. Kayak all the way \u2026",
          "We love this Roman aqueduct. We have brought friends here several times and no one has ever been disappointed. They just do not build things the way they used to. This aqueduct is more than 2000 years old.",
          "One of the best preserved pieces of Roman architecture. Also an amazing insight into their engineering skills. The museum is also interesting and deserves at least an hour. In general, easily a half-day activity and it's also a great outing for young families. ",
          "Hadn't done my homework and expected to pull up by the side of the road, peer over the edge, be impressed by an old ruin, coo about it's majesty and clear off.  Instead, you have to partake in the \"experience\" at the cost of 8.5 euros a pop \u2026",
          "Beautiful and peaceful place",
          "A truly magnificent structure set in a beautiful river valley. Best seen off season when there are less visitors. The visitor centre is brilliant and brings to life the times it was built, and explains why water was so important. They really do these things well in France.",
          "Recommend for someone who can drive there.",
          "What have the Romans ever done for us? :-) \nClose to Avignon this place it\u2019s definitely worth visiting. It was on our way to N\u00eemes. We stopped to have a look just because it is on the UNESCO\u2019s list and we ended up spending half of the day here. The river is also very nice, plan your visit properly and don\u2019t miss kayaking.",
          "Drove to the south parking lot and walked in.  Plenty of parking, well marked trails and polite informative staff.  The historical site itself is great.  Overlooks are have clear views of the river and site.  The visitor center and museum have plenty of information.",
          "Must see! If visiting during summer time, swim gear highly recommend",
          "Extremely beautiful place. Challenge is when to go, so there is not too many people. Recommend it for day trip to enjoy the wonder of the bridge.",
          "Went Kayaking under the Pont du Gard, amazing!!",
          "I enjoy a lot of the grand view and the tranquility of this place.",
          "We are not typically museum people. I mean, we enjoy an art museum, but museums that focus on artifacts seem a bit sad to me. Important, precious things taken from their place in time and space to be put on display, sterilized, and \u2026",

          "This is an amazing site given the Roman aqueduct is 2,000 years old and was functioning to bring water to homes and fountains for 600 years. The views are amazing from the right and left sides and you can hike and bike some nice trails as well. A lot of teens and families",
          "Beautiful Roman monument where to spend time with family and friends even for young children. Lot activities around, we had a lovely time in nature environment.",
          "Thought the whole site was good value. For \u20ac9.50 per adult there was a film, museum with Roman artefacts and info on the story of the aqueduct. These are housed in a modern building which has cafe and toilets etc. Then there is the Pont itself. Amazing to see and think how long",
          "Superb place to visit, great view of the aqueduct on the approach and up on the hill behind it. There is parking and facilities at both banks. We parked at the Rive droite. Good parking, even for an RV. Nice reception area. The view and walk up to the aqueduct is better from",
          "Plenty to walk around and see and you can walk in the river however I would recommend wearing some suitable footwear that can get wet as the pebbles hurt your feet! I would also recommend taking a picnic as there is plenty of room to side on river banks and the food/drinks in",
          "As you walk up to the aqueduct and you see it for the first time it is awe inspiring. So mssive and such a technological achievement for today never mind 2000 years ago! In the visitor centre is a fantastic museum with bi lingual info boards and a great video shown in a massive",
          "We visited here on the same day that the Tour de France had a stage start here so luckily entrance was free. The bridge is very impressive but far more so when its age is taken into account. Visiting near sunset was a magical experience as the sun was making the stones a lovely",

          "Arriving by car you can chose to take Nord or Gaure entrace. We took Nord without knowing more about it. On the Nord side there was a large parking lot included in ticket. Small visitor center had ticket office, some information and exhibition stuff and toilet. Walking to Pont",
          "Were it not for the sea of tourists, this would be a great place to explore. A visit in autumn (when it's also less hot) is advisable. Before visiting the Pont itself, watch the video presentation and explore the adjacent museum.",
          "We spent a really enjoyable 4 hours there with 2 children. Starting with the detailed museum then the short cinema and a quick (overpriced) bite to eat then down to the bridge and a lovely swim to cool off in the river below. The history and sheer scale of the aqueduct is",
          "Well worth signing up for one of the twice daily, 45 minute guided tours from the ticket office. \u20ac6/person is good value and Emma spoke really great English.",
          "This place charges a pretty hefty 9.50\u20ac per adult just to enter the exhibit and bridge area. We mostly came for a swim so it was a bit expensive. Skip the cinema experience unless you\u2019re up for a quick snooze.",
          "We planned to view the Pont du Gard at the end of a long day sightseeing in the area, driving past and having a stroll along the river, like the last time we visited, clearly some time ago! Since that time the whole of the Pont du Gard area has been closed off to traffic and is",
          "I have always wanted to go to the Pont du Gard. Expectations can be high - but this exceeded them. I thought I was just going to see the bridge over the river, but it was so much more. It cost 9 Euros per adult, but this was the best value for money on our whole holiday. The",
          "Really nice. Loved walking around getting different views. Worth more time here than given on tour. Take swimmers and cool off in the river",
          "What a wonderful surprise. We went by one of the many fruit vendors on our drive in to bring a snack. The kids put on their swimsuits and we went into Pont Du Gard. we went through the museum which was really amazing. It showed the architecture 0 building techniques and other",
          "While in the south of France, my wife and I decided to see if there were any World Heritage Sites within driving distance from Montpellier. Sure enough this architectural masterpiece was close by. There is nothing like beholding a man made structure in the present. No photo",
          "We went to Pont Du Card on July 11th, 2019. It was a very hot day but breezy and we ended up parking on the left bank instead of the right bank, which is the museum and garden side where tourists should park. But on the Left side, the parking was easy, we noticed several",
          "I cycled here in the morning, came off the main cycle track and followed the shingle track alongside the river, up onto the proper path, over the bridge and then cross country, all free. Later, my wife and I returned, in the car. We parked in the official carpark and entered",
          "The Pont du Gard is a beautiful Roman aqueduct in excellent condition. It is worth half an hour of your time. It is not worth 10 Euros. Which is what they charge you to park and visit.",
          "Amazing to see this 2000+ year-old aqueduct - the engineering feat of the Romans. We were lucky when we visited in early June. The weather was perfect (72 degrees F) and there were very few tourists. The museum was very interesting and informative. Take in the view from all",
          "I returned 2 years after my first visit and guess what, still standing and still as impressive, the Pont du Gard must be one of the best examples of mans building expertise, considering it was built almost 2000 years ago! Contrary to most guide books, I prefer to park on the",
          "This preserved portion of the 50 km long Roman aqueduct from Uz\u00e8s to N\u00eemes is a historical wonder of engineering, architecture, and aesthetics. The graceful arches and columns would not shame a temple, and the natural setting across the Gardon River is sublime, with numerous",
          "Loved seeing the aqueduct in person. But the guided tour was unimpressive. I read that you went up to the top of the Pont du Gard but that is no longer the case, it has been closed since May because of damage. So I was a little bit disappointed in the tour. Overall it\u2019s very",
          "Avoid the extortionate entrance fee and queues. In the sweltering heat we would have been unable to walk from the car park to the bridge so we went to Castillon du Gard. There is a free car park and you can see the bridge (although its about 2 miles away!) from Chemin du Jeu de",
          "Be prepared to walk 30-45 minutes total from the parking lot to get to the museum! But the walk is worth it as you get the view of the aqueduct. The museum itself is a little disappointing - it has a lot of good content regarding the engineering of the aqueduct but it requires",

          "I\u2019m sorry to say I was a bit underwhelmed with our visit to this very important monument. The size of the car parks contribute to the hype and we chose to enter on the side opposite the museum. You pay an entrance fee and then a short walk leads to the spectacular",
          "We parked in Remoulins at the bull ring (free) and walked the couple of miles through lovely wooded camping areas to Pont Du Gard. The lady in Remoulins Tourist Info has sold us Pont Du Gard tickets for E8 each. You don't need these if you walk from Remoulins - you just arrive",
          "This is difficult because there is a long gap between the last bus in the morning to the Pont from Avignon and the next one back to Avignon in the afternoon. But it is worth the journey and advisable to take picnic food and your bathing suit so you can spend the spare hours",
          "This is a fabulous site to visit and is a great example of the ingenuity of the Romans as they conquered to the west but created excellent transport structures in their wake",
          "Well what can I say.......the actual Aquaduct is impressive and well worth seeing. Sadly the cost of the entry ticket is extortionate. 9.50 euro per person which included parking fees. As there were two of us that meant we both paid for parking although only travelled in ONE",
          "Not to be missed if you are in the area. Nice cafe for lunch on the property. Beautiful spot to relax and people watch or take a hike.",
          "Pont du Gard is really a worthwhile visit, the actual structure is amazing and the surrounding area is lovely making it well worth a visit. It is amazing to see a structure that was built centuries ago still standing.",
          "The site is superb. Built in the 1st Century AD, it served as a Roman aqueduct and bridge. The museum and grounds are amazing to visit.",
          "Expected a overtouristed roadside attraction - what we got was beyond amazing! The aqueduct is an engineering feat beyond compare - delivering 9 million gallons of water per day to N\u00eemes. The museum highlighting how this was built and giving a great overview of Roman water",
          "We arrived at Pont du Gard after the place was closed but you could still walk up the the aquaduct. We parked right in front along with several cars and strolled up for a view. When we got back to the car after just 45 minutes our car had been broken into and all our luggage",
          "What a incredible place to see a real Roman aqueduct as built and the area is so well maintained. I wish we had brought our bathing suits and I would recommend it! Great swimming and kayaking is available. We enjoyed our short stay.",
          "A really lovely place for a picnic, but charging 10 euros per person for a place that was once free is kinda sad. Plan to spend the day here with kayaking n picnic to maximise your money",
          "We scheduled a tour that included visiting this landmark. It was well worth the time and cost. A must see when visiting this region.",
          "Amazing place. Pont du Garde is it one of the most wonderful ancient monuments in the worlds, surrounded by a quiet place, ideal to relax, swim, picn nic annd also romantic view. Do not miss",
          "The tour of the Pont Du Aqueduct was amazing. This feat of Roman engineering was really worth visiting. The climb to the top (about 100 steps) is not for the faint hearted but really worth the effort.",
          "Dont take a tour, get a bus ticket at the bus station and they will drop you off withing walking distance to the Pont du Gard. Amazing engineering skills and to think it was almost 2000 years ago!!",
          "Pont du Gard was on my list of must see Roman ruins in France and I was not disappointed. In order to really appreciate it, some knowledge of the structure, and it\u2019s purpose is imperative. The fact that it was built around 5BC to 5AD well over 2000 years ago, and that it carried",
          "We drove here and it was really easy to find the car park. On entering the car park you get a ticket which is included in your admission fee. The car park is big and easy to get around. We then walked to the ticket office. You can either buy your tickets at a machine or go to a",
          "It was amazing to see the engineering skills of people in the first century who built this aqueduct. The museum is very interesting, but it should be open when the site opens instead of waiting until 12 noon to open. Our experience would have been more enjoyable if we had been",
          "This is really a must-see piece of Roman architecture in southern France. There is ample parking, a good visitor centre and museum. A short film gives the background to its building and preservation. A short walk along good paths (no problem for wheelchair users) brings you",
          "We saw as a cruise ship excursion on a beautiful sunny day. It is an amazing structure to see. Great views.",
          "The Pont du Gard is well worth visiting. You can approach and park either the Rive Gauche or the Rive Droite but if you want to arrive and be close to the museum and cinema then park at Rive Gauche. Visiting off season was clearly an advantage as the site clearly caters for",
          "It's a nice walk from the parking lot to Pont du Gard and once there's you'll enjoy the views of the river as well as the close-up views of architecture. You can also take a boat trip down the river, which many visitors took advantage of.",
          "WHS so it\u2019s full of tours and tour buses, so be ready for large crowds. Nicely setup, easy walking and lots of history to match lots of people. 2 hours is plenty, the movie is basic also. Needs much more specific information for a WHS.",
          "this is an awesome site! it's the tallest roman aqueduct and very impressive. it's in great shape and well worth the trip to see it. if you want a great way to access it, stay at la begrudge saint pierre hotel, a charming hotel just a mile away. you can walk from there to the",

          "Magnificent structure and story that I highly advise everyone to see. The park is well organized for hikers, viewers, swimmers, and a museum that informs. You can do it in an hour if in a hurry, otherwise schedule up to three hours to do it right. Line to get in was short and it",

          "We were not sure if we could go to Pont Du Gard on a day that was really windy. We had a great time walking with the wind pushing us toward the Aqueduct. I am always amazed at the arch in the aqueduct that no mortar or cement is used, relying on gravity to hold in place.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to this site. The aqueduct is a beautiful structure in a tranquil setting. The architecture and engineering and its longevity is impressive. Access is excellent with lots of parking and well maintained trails. I recommend setting aside two hours for",
          "This was a beautiful experience! From the left side, the path was paved and mostly level with slight decline to the aqueduct. On the right side of the aqueduct you can reach the water but it requires walking on rocky decline terrain. We waded in the water for a bit before",
          "It's an aqueduct. Not much to say. Spent about 10 minutes there. It was a peaceful visit, not crowded. There's a tunnel you can walk through or you can walk across the aqueduct. This seems like a good place for kids. It has a large grass area to run and play but, it is near",
          "Take a nice ride out of Avignon and into the country to visit this place. It's beautifully situated in a nice park. We viewed it from a short distance away in an open field, which is the best way to get the full feel for the immensity of this place. Visitors can also hike",
          "The old aquaduct is great to see... but the museum has poor quality... audio facilities don't work... lighting doesn't work in various places so you can' t see the exhibits...NOT well maintained . At one place one can take pictures as a knight and a maid... but the clothing is",

          "I had been wanting to see this for years - and it was well worth it. A footbridge was built alongside the Roman aqueduct some time ago, so you can really see it up close. I understand that you can buy a ticket which will allow you to get to other parts. There is a short film",
          "That this aqueduct was built 2000 years ago just to carry water from Uzes to Nimes beggars belief. It appears in excellent condition, and sits beautifully in the ever gorge. There is a substantial, modern, ticket, shop cafe and museum building well out of sight of the",

          "It is hard to believe how impressive this huge structure actually is! And that Romans built it and the 40km of aquaduct with such accuracy with simple tools is mind boggling. The river and countryside are also very worth seeing. There are some nice walks, viewpoints, restaurant",
          "You do not realise the size of the structure until you actually get to see it in reality. The scenes from documentaries and pictures do not it justice. From the car park you walk to the main entrance then along a path then around the corner it appears in its full glory. The",

          "This is an incredible place to see. It is an amazing construction but my mind is more for the person (2000 years ago) who looked at the gorge (and, in fact, all the route from the water source through to Nimes) and say \"we can build this\". If you just want a little walk in,",
          "This is an amazing historical place. The aqueduct is incredible, but do NOT miss the museum in a rush to get to the main attraction. The museum will fill you in on a lot of history and details. It's very well done.",

          "You have to go and see it. Worth the detour, allow at least 3 hours. We didn't do the tour of the top level, it looked unsuitable for the less agile and those with vertigo issues. Plenty of parking and eating either side of the valley.",

          "After making a detour to visit the Pont du Gard, we were very surprised to have to pay a minimum of 8.50 euros just to look at the aqueduct. The surrounding area is enclosed by an extensive fence that limits access only to ticket holders. This entrance fee also allows you access",

          "We stopped here on our way through from South to northern France. Ur was a whistle stop trip to see the bridge and we were only there for about 30 minus. It was a beautiful structure. Parking is good and included in the ticket. Ticket prices start from \u20ac8.50 depending on",
          "Make sure you walk to the western face of the bridge on the right bank to view the Roman work in all its glory. The museum contains a lot of useful information but is very disappointing as it is VERY dimly lit which makes you think it must be for protecting fragile original",
          "Surprisingly difficult to get to from Nimes unless you have a car. We went by local bus which was ok (and very cheap) but it meant that ve could either spend just over an hour there or more than 4 hours. The aqueduct itself is magnificent. There are various categories of ticket",
          "If you around Nimes Area; you must absolutely visit the Pont du Gard. This aqueduct reminds the visitor of the fantastic engineering capacities of the Romans. They built quite a few aqueducts in France to bring water to their cities. What is interesting in these constructions",
          "The tour from our River Rhone cruise one day took us to Pont du Gard and Uzes. It is unfortunate that so much was crammed into an afternoon. This is not the fault of this venue which we enjoyed immensely, indeed we would have preferred more time there. The aqueduct itself is a",

          "I have a PhD in history, but I did not understand anything about aqueducts before spending an afternoon at this amazing site last week. I took the advice of another reviewer and booked the full tour, which was ABSOLUTELY the best historical experience of the trip. Imagine: the",
          "The bridge itself is also a wonderful site. Saw it a few yea ago in the daytime and thought it was worth a detour while traveling in the So of France. This time we made our plans around the timing of the light show. Several times/ yr ( check the website) in the dark sky.",
          "As an architecture buff, I have always been impressed by what the Romans constructed centuries ago. But this Roman bridge over the Gardon River in the South of France truly has a major wow factor that stopped me in my tracks. I had been ambling along a walking trail from the",
          "Well worth the time to visit and walk the whole site. If you have more time, you can swim in the river and make a day of it. The Roman construction is amazing!",
          "It's just as glorious as the pictures make it out, and although you can't walk on the aqueduct, there's hiking trails and views up in the hills around it, as well as a museum. It seemed pretty crowded when I was there, and it wasn't even high tourist season. There's an",
          "We stopped here from our way from Montpellier to Marseilles. The place is beautiful. Entrance is not for free.",
          "The viaduct itself is impressive - from an engineering perspective as well as aesthetically. The river is good for swimming, its banks the perfect place for a great stroll and to \u2018chill\u2019. Cafe style facilities available.",
          "You don't have to be a history or architecture buff to enjoy this. We were blown away by the scale and grandeur of Pont Du Gard. Even better to see families picnicking and swimming around the site. Fantastic. Worth a walk up to the high ground and view the aqueduct from elevated",
          "What do you say about the Pont du Gard? Obviously it is one of the great wonders of the world. The museum is helpful as well, so that you more fully appreciate why this architectural feat is so remarkable. We visited on a lovely afternoon, so we enjoyed a shady amble across",
          "We found Pont du Gard on the internet while traveling in France. We decided to fit in a visit and were so glad we did! This is an amazing sight to see. We went on the right side of the river and quickly discovered the better view was from the left so we walked across the",
          "This had long been on my list of places to visit and it did not disappoint! It is a spectacular example of Roman engineering. We parked on the side opposite the museum which meant we got to see the aqueduct up close as soon as we arrived. You see it from the river as you",
          "With the full tour, we were able to walk through the water channel. It's one thing to read or hear how much mineral deposited on the side, it's quite different to see it up close and touch it. I had very high expectations for this bridge/aqueduct, and I was blown away with the",

          "The last time I'd been was almost 35 years ago, when I visited this same place with my parents and siblings. A lot has changed since, there's no more vehicle traffic across the aqueduct and it's now classed a World Heritage Site by Unesco, but I was happy to see the magnificent",
          "This Roman Aqueduct in its stunning location over a deep gorge was to be one of the highlights of our sketching holiday. Our picnic on the banks of the Gard was idyllic and we settled down to draw in some shade. Sadly they are drilling with some heavy machinery on the riverbank",
          "We headed to Pont du Gard without doing an research, and thinking it would be a bit of some ruins of the Aquaduct. Take some selfies, get back in the car. But no. First, you need to enter the \"grounds\" to see the structure at all. There are parking lots and entrances on",
          "The Romans built a water line to provide the city of nimes with water. The biggest structure in the line is the aquaduct of pont du gard. Built in only 5 years the structure really is a marvel. !!!!",

          "This is probably the most impressive Roman Aqueduct still in existence, with three rows of arches, and built some 2000 years ago it is simply outstanding There is a very useful visitors entrance, with good toilets and a small Caf\u00e9 We spent a couple of hours walking the site",
          "Good directions to both the left and right banks of this magnificent example of Roman Engineering. Pricey, but the arrangements for a quick cinema, well produced and very informative, is a great preview to the sight.",
          "Impressive roman aqueduct. So big, especially when you think that it was build 2000 years ago. Although it's 2000 years old, it is in very good condition. Nice area around - there's a river, green area, even a forest. You could have a picnic and relax a few hours, even an entire",
          "You will be aw-struck as you come around the corner and suddenly see this amazing sight. My husband and I had been before, but this time brought out daughter and Grandsons (9 and 7 yrs). My daughter was a bit concerned that the boys would not be interested in seeing an old",
          "Great monument in a well Maintained park. If you want to walk the 2nd and 3rd level of the aqueduct, make sure you book online way in advance. They have only organized tour for 35 people per day. Unfortunately we were too late for that. Go to rive gauche to start as it",
          "Set aside at least 2 - 3 hours to enjoy this magnificent Roman site. We didn't realise that only a certain number of tickets are available to view the Pont du Gard at close quarters but it didn't matter as the grounds are so big and beautiful. Take a picnic lunch and make a day",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Pont du Gard. There is an informative museum prior to visiting the bridge which was quite good. It explains how the bridge was built and how it influenced the town of Nimes. This is a wonderfully preserved Roman bridge which was part of a 30",
          "While it took a while to actually get to the bridge, it was certainly worth it. Having visited in early April on a Sunday afternoon, if you want to obtain access to the 3rd level, buy your tickets in advance so you are not disappointed. It seems that they limit the number of",
          "After kayaking under the aqueduct, we drove over to see the musuem. Excellent and interactive. This site explained what we had just paddled under and the path up and around the monument is very doable and enjoyable. A must-see on any trip to Provence.",
          "Visited this site as part lf a tour around France. The bridge and sorroundings area kept in pristine condition, in spite of the pass of time!",
          "I visited from Australia and, wow, what a wonderful piece of Roman engineering. Access is easy, the view is amazing and museum explains how the Romans got those great stone bricks so far up in the air. The aqueduct itself is an imposing and amazing piece of work.",
          "We went out of our way to visit this amazing site, not knowing what to expect. And there it was in all its magnificence. Nothing phone - no extra adornment -- just a silent sentinel magnificent bridging a valley as it has for thousands of years, a tribute to our distant past and",

          "Our first of many visits to the area was over 30 years ago, the first to the actual bridge was with local friends we were visiting in April many years ago and we fell in love with it. To see its sheer scale and realize that it was started just BC and took 60-80 years to complete",
          "While many of our bridges are in need of repair and some fall down, this ancient Roman aqueduct built in the first century AD still stands. Sure, it could use repairing, too, but it may have been in use as late as the 6th century. They built things to last back then. Seriously,",
          "so glad we went here and spent several hours on the beach, in the water (my tween boys and husband were jumping off rocks and swimming) and hiking the bridge. It was packed (this was last July) but still very glad we went. Amazing structure!",
          "Fantastic monument. So interesting, so much history. Good shops, museum, caf\u00e9s, a lovely view of the river under the bridge, don't miss this if you're in the region.",
          "Around 2000 years old and still impressive. What must this have been like when first built? If in the area a visit to the Pont du Gard is a must. Built by the Romans, this aqueduct remains a great piece of architecture. You can walk around and under it to get some great",

          "We drove specifically to visit this place from Avignon. The aqueduct gives you a sense of history and scale. It is immense and tallest one still in existence and ever built in this area. Whether you start on the la rive droite (right side) or la rive gauche (left side) be sure",
          "This is a stunning sight. One of the best in all of France. It\u2019s remarkably well preserved and has a real sense of peace about it. For those of you travelling on local transport there are easy bus connections from Nimes and Ales. The Edgard bus company has an office right",
          "The acqueduct of Pont du Gard is one of the most well preserved roman aqueduct tracts in the world. The location is wonderful and families can anjoy a lot of walks on the hills around the monument or just relax on the beaches along the river",
          "The Romans built some amazing things and this is one of them. The entrances are easy to find. We were able to walk from one side to the other so it really doesn't matter on which side you park. The museum is okay. But the aquaduct itself is just extraordinary to see. The",
          "The high point of our south of France trip. The tour guide spent way too long in misguiding us through the museum, and we really would have preferred to do it on our own. But it was a beautiful day for a walk, and the aqueduct exceeded my expectations. Over and over I had to",
          "A well preserved Roman aqueduct with a fantastic museum explaining how it was made and how it functioned throught the history of N\u00eemes. If you're into roman history, architecture, or ancient ruins, it is well worth the visit.",
          "In high season, there is huge tourist interest and pressure here in addition, at weekends, to the river being used as an impromptu water park too! The addition of the visitors centre a few years ago has certainly improved the facilities greatly, but the cost to visit has also",
          "Extremely well-kept Roman aqueduct. Below it there is a large beach. Definitely worth the visit. It's about half an hour by car from Nimes.",
          "When you see photos of France, this is one of the ionic landmarks that is included. I decided to switch our optional excursion from Chateauneuf-du-Pape to visiting the Pont du Gard Aqueduct instead. Boy am I glad that I did that. Close to Avignon, we traveled along the",
          "Went as a half-day trip from Avignon, thinking it would just be a park with some ruins... was very pleasantly surprised by a very well-thought-out and educational museum, which detailed the roman lifestyle and its dependence on water, through the construction of the aqueduct and",
          "Really cool to visit, take a picnic, and go for a swim. Came with friends during the weekend, it is pretty crowded with lots of people around the river when it's hot. We sat directly under the aqueduct and took turns swimming in the river and jumping off the rocks. I also took",

          "It is a good idea to stop at the museum before taking the trail leading to the Gardon River and the Pont du Gard aqueduct. In the museum you will see models and multi media presentations explaining the ancient Roman engineering project to bring water from miles away to this",
          "This has long been on my bucket list, in fact, since my university days when I listened to my art history professor talk about a Roman engineering and architectural achievement in the south of France and watched his slides of this ancient aqueduct. We took a day tour from",
          "The bridge/aqueduct is an impressive architectural marvel considering it was 2000 years ago. There is a bus that can get you there from Nimes, then it\u2019s a short walk. Worth it! The short film is user friendly and gives a little info on the history. I recommend the trip.",
          "Visited with husband and teen daughter in August. Extremely hot and busy. Entered car park to find out what the entry fee to see Pont du Gard was - did not have the entire day to spend there, just a couple of hours. The cost was astronomical for three of us so we decided not to",
          "It's pity that such a beautiful place is kept by dull people who obstruct the street to the bridge. There is a planned free bike path that they have made it impassable to force you to pay their ticket for a public monument. The bike path has become a forest, here after few",
          "Dear people of Pont du Gard, We\u2019ve been travelling through France for quite some time now. We\u2019ve seen so many monuments that I lost count. For the last day in France, I just wanted to have a stroll past the Pont du Gard, I never had any intention of actually visiting and",
          "We had wanted to see this attraction for ages but you can see everything by buying the general ticket and trust us, the view is much better from the beach than on the bridge itself. The museum and film are also highly missable since the curation is pretty poor and not hugely",
          "The Pont-du-Gard is a superb site - not to be missed. You are looking at a Roman aqueduct nearly 2000 years old and in a superb state (albeit restored over the years). The location, between rocks and over a lovely river, is glorious. So what's not to like? The company",
          "Well preserved Monument close to Arles and N\u00eemes. Some walking needed but no difficult paths unless you decide to visit the guided tour to different floors of the monument. Overpriced shop and cafes/restaurant but entry fee worth the price. Parking fee included in entry ticket.",
          "It's a shame to have to pay to get inside the place but at least the ticket (8,50\u20ac minimum) covers the parking. The bridge is really impressive. The museum gives a lot of details about the Romain's way of life in Southern France and many informations about their buildings",
          "200 years ago the world's tallest roman bridge was built in only 5 years. It is a remarkable spectacle and it was great to visit on a fine autumnal day when there were relatively few people there. We parked on the right bank (the less popular) and walked across to the other side",
          "We are so glad we took the time to visit this out of the way attraction. It is well worth your time!! It is absolutely spectacular. Just an FYI if you do take the bus from Nimes. We missed the last one because we stood in the wrong spot for the bus pick-up. The drop off spot is",
          "There are left and right bank car parks, and it appeared that the greater range of facilities are on the right - but it is easy to walk across the lower bridge adjacent to the Pond du Gard. Parking is \u20ac8, but this is deducted from your ticket to the site - we opted for the",

We bought our tickets and proceeded to the museum and to watched a short film (which didn\u2019t actually give any real history",

          "We thought that this would be a quick stop, see the bridge, take a picture and move on. How wrong we were! We took time to visit the museum before walking to the bridge. What a worthwhile and informative visit. It was incredible to see the \"advanced\" technology that was used",
          "We were fortunate to travel in mid-October with summer-like weather and off season \"crowd\" levels. We read that this location was a \"tourist trap\" but we could not disagree more. The entire grounds are large, well maintained and well presented. You can walk endless trails,",
          "The man from whom we rented our airbnb said not to bother. \"It's only a bridge.\" We are so very glad we went anyway. We could have spent an entire day here as it's been beautifully designed for tourists--large parking lots, good signage, a spacious restaurant with restrooms,",
          "A spectacular accomplishment of the Eoman period.Great views down to the river.You can walk on the bridge too.Museum and excellent audio show.",
          "We took a canoe trip, I think 8 km long. A view of huge aqueduct from Roman period from the river below is magnificent. You can pull up short and feast your eyes on art of ancient builders.",
          "We take a bus then walk about 10 minutes arrived there. It is a wonderful bridge keeping well. But it can not walk across the bridge.",
          "This is truly an amazing sight. This aqueduct was built 2,000 years ago; and it is still standing. The engineering involved is astounding. Yes, it has deteriorated into nothing like it was back when Jesus Christ was walking around in Israel, but most of the 'damage' was",
          "Well worth the 8.50 euro parking plus 17 euro admittance for two. Unable to take the tour as had the dog who was not allowed. Nice walks around the site which was enjoyed by the dog. Nice restaurant beside the river.",
          "On a pleasant day, you can take your time to fully appreciate this incredible structure. The pedestrian bridge gives you a close up view. Moreover, the museum is loaded with fascinating exhibits presented in a modern entertaining fashion. There is a short film as well. Don't",
          "WOW! The second largest Roman structure in Europe. It is massive and VERY impressive. Be sure to buy a premium ticket (with guide) so you can walk the actual aqueduct at the very top (the standard ticket only allows you to walk across the foot bridge lower on the structure).",
          "The Pont du Gard is an amazing aqueduct but even more impressive if you chose to watch it passing under in a canoe - highly recommendable",
          "This fantastic Roman aquaduct is a must to visit, the aquaduct is huge not only built to carry water it was also built to alow easy level acess for the Romans and all since to cross this wide gorge and fast flowing river. On arrival buy your ticket which will cover your parking",
          "How things have changed since my last visit 30 years ago! Pont du Gard is the same but the surrounding area has been developed beyond recognition. Despite this it still a 'must see' site and the introduction of cafes and toilets is a definite plus.",
          "One walks around a bend from the parking lot and--POW!--there it is, truly one of the masterpieces of man-made wonder. Even now, 2,000 years after having been built, it inspires awe. Be sure to see the video and visit the museum, for they provide a context not only for how it",
          "Impressive Roman Aqueduct - a must-see UNESCO world heritage site. Museum is very interesting. Parking included in ticket price, cheapest version of 8.50\u20ac is sufficient. Nice walk along river.",
          "Wow absolutely stunning! We got there quite late in the day so did not have time to do more than glance through the museum, but the aqueduct itself was stunning. Also worth the walk to the viewing area back over the aqueduct.",
          "Nothing prepares you for the majestic site of this bridge as it comes into view. You can view it from both sides of the river and the three tiers are just amazing. As you come up to the bridge, if you go down the track on the right, by the river you can get all three arches",
          "Easy to get to and what a marvel of Roman architecture. It is amazing that this was almost torn down several times throughout history. The Roman's really knew how to build needed systems.",
          "Having seen pictures of the aqueduct in textbooks ever since high school, I was ready and willing to be amazed. The museum and its interactive exhibits were fascinating, and my friends and I stayed considerably longer than expected. The Pont itself defies description and must",
          "Pictures simply cannot do justice to the majesty of this 2000-year old Roman aqueduct which bridges the Gardon River outside Nimes and not far from Uzes and Avignon. One has a choice of tickets, so if you have never been there before, we strongly suggest seeing not only the",
          "Went with my son as part of our road trip and spent many hours here longer than we expected. The heat was a bit oppressive but the tree shade helped and the visitor centre shade was a relief. You can do as much or as little as you want and with my walking limited I managed to",
          "Wonderful place to visit for those who love Roman ruins - although this one is in excellent shape. There is a museum which describes the building of the aqueduct and its long route. Then you can walk up and cross a bridge that was built to give access to the whole thing.",
          "You can approach the bridge from the left or right banks. Parking fee is included in the entry ticket. 5-7 minute walk from the ticket office to the bridge. You can walk across the bridge on the lower level. Quite a few people and selfie sticks around. The river when I visited",

          "An incredible piece of history, immense architecture and brilliant engineering. Worth the early rise, arrived at opening with a few cars, so had place to ourselves. Very atmospheric, incredible sight, I cried with the spectacle. Worth crossing bridge, then walking north along",
          "The ticket includes parking. Go dip your feet in the river, then hike down the bank a bit and enjoy the view. Grab some ice cream on the way out and it's a great 2 hours for about 20\u20ac.",
          "A lovely bridge on two levels. This bridge is across the river and surrounded by views and walks. We walked along some trails which was perfect. Very impressive and very organised.",
          "Only a 1min walk from the entrance gate. We didn't do the walking tracks around the bridge due to lack of time..... but the bridge was stunning. If you have time, pack a picnic and wine and then do the walking trail. Nicely kept track and trees. The \u20ac8.50 was worth it.",
          "This site is place is so slick they have everything covered, from the parking which is included with your ticket price. Took the cheaper one as the tours to the aqueducts thrice level didn't start til later and this was the right choice for us as you can still walk over the",

          "Well worth the drive excellent views and fantastic scenery, from both sides of the river a little more on the history side could have been more visible",
          "What a fantastic place history brought to life. You need most of a day to get the most out of this venue. Cost is very good value for money.",
          "We started our tour with an interesting film show of the structure and how it was constructed. Then a tour of the museum showing artifacts and construction methods used in the building. It is a reasonable walk from the entrance to the actual aqueduct. It was a lovely warm day so",
          "Brilliant place to spend the day, we explored the site which is easy to find. We had a hire car and parking was plentiful, we paid the 8 euros each just to explore the bottom tear and chill on the beach. Would go back again tomorrow, really stunning place to chill on a hot day.",
          "An amazingly well preserved Roman structure in a stunning setting. Probably should have done the full tour which includes access to the third tier. That said, walking across and going down to the river give a great perspective of scale and purpose. Have seen photos of it all my",
          "Magnificent bridge. Three stories high. Huge. Easy walking from the parking lot fantastic spot for photographers.",
          "If in this part of France, a visit to this site is a must. An unbelievable feat of engineering and testament to that feat is the fact that after 2000 years it us still basically intact. There is an excellent Museum as you enter that has wonderful exhibits that explains how",
          "I stayed in a small French town called Remoulins which was so close to Pont du Gard (the famous Roman aqueduct) you could ride a bike there. It costs six Eros to get in but that was well worth it. A beautiful park set up besides the Gardon river. As I turned the corner there",
          "Spectacular piece of heritage. Well worth seeing. Take the trip to the top (signed 'view point') to get a view from above. One word of warning - the parking is expensive. Ticket machine issues a parking ticket but it must be taken to the payment office closer to the site prior",
          "can get here on the local bus from the bus station just next to the railway station in Avignon. The busses are not frequent though so check out the latest timetables. Bus stops are at the rounabout just at the end of the road leading to the Pont. Worth getting the ticket that",
          "Our second visit and we echo some reviews about how stunning the aqueduct is and how the car park works. When walking about the area you forget about the cost but the car park is mystifying. On this occasion we hoped to do lunch and view but after parking and an extended walk we",
          "Amazing in size and beauty (especially as it used to be even bigger than its current size). Good information centre and museum with cafe and swimming and kayaking opportunities in the river. Definitely worth a visit. Those Romans sure knew how to build....",
          "Site of a Roman aquaduct. Very steep climb to the top, but absolutely worth the effort, even for sufficiently interested people still in their 70's!! Also followed water to its source several Km away.",
          "We happened across signs to Pont du Gard on the way from Nimes to The Ardeche. It was a fantastic find although it was a relatively short stop we did not want to pay to park. We were lucky to find a place a bit away just off the road and walked through a lovely wood on a",
          "One of the places i always wanted to visit, however, it is very difficult by public transport unless you want to take a bus from Nimes. We eventually took a half day trip organised from the Tourist Office in Arles. We arrived at Pont du Gard just after 9:00 in the morning and",
          "Many photographs have been taken and lots of words have been written about this piece of history. The thing which the photographs do not prepare you for is the sheer physical size of this structure, as few photographs I have seen include people for a point of reference. So while",
          "We were driving from Rustiques, France to Lake Annecy and had noticed that the Pont du Gard was not far off our route. Being a huge fan of all things Roman, we decided to swing by there. This entire region of France was heavily populated with Romans 2,000 years ago. Everywhere",
          "C'est magnifique. The structure is impressive and imposing. Signage is great and in three languages; the museum is informative. It is good value for money.",
          "Must see if visit south of France. The bridge was good but what made it better was the very informative museum that gave you a broad context for roman life in southern France. Did not go on tour where you get to go on top but passing bridge was fun! Good walks around!",
          "The bridge aqueduct is a stunning site with very interesting history but the bilingual guide was rushed to give the information in French then English and at one point left the anglophones behind totally. However she did give background info that made the visit more interesting.",
          "Great structure and a must for any fan of history. We had young kids so we didn't do this but I was recommended to canoe down the river (it's pretty calm). We took lunch in the restaurant over the river, pretty good and reasonable price given location. Take your swimming togs,",
          "This is a World Heritage Site and well worth a visit. We were staying in Avignon and took the A15 bus from the Gare Routiere which is at the side of the SNCF Gare outside the city walls. The journey takes about 30 minutes. On arrival at the Pont Du Rond bus stop there is a",
          "This was my first exposure to Roman ruins 40 years ago. When I first saw it I was amazed at the size and height of it. Forty Years later, I am still amazed at the engineering that went into the construction of this Roman water system. The scenery in this area is lovely, relaxing",
          "Beautiful park! The bridge is absolutely gorgeous, the only downside is that you pay for parking plus tickets! Parking should've been included on tickets prices.",
          "If you are in the region this is a must see attraction. Very well organised from the parking to visiting the aqueduct and the museum that is on the site. Depending upon your level of interest you could spend hours at the attraction. For most people the introductory film, the",
          "Visited in February so it wasn't crowded. Get the guided tour. It adds so much to the experience. Spend some extra time in the museum, as well. You'll be glad you did.",
          "Some reviewers say one doesn't need a ticket. Oh well, we bought the basic ticket anyway. We drove as we were staying in the area. Brought a picnic and our swim stuff. Did a little walk to the aqueduct and then past it. (didn't cross yet) Walked down the river. Had bunch of",
          "What a great day out. This site was easy to find and well sign posted. We started the day by watching the film about the history of the aqueduct in the huge air conditioned cinema. We then went to the museum which was very interesting and well presented. We were disappointed not",
          "I am an American living in France with my French hubby...we are from Normandy, so this vacation season for us started in Sept....we decided to go to the south and so far I am not disappointed...the pont du gard is one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen...for us not",
          "My wife and I took a guided walking tour in mid August 2017 of the Pont de Gard aqueduct, one of the best preserved pieces of Roman architecture, a world heritage UNESCO monument, and an amazing insight into Roman engineering skills. Our tour also included the museum, cinema,",
          "Well worth a visit. Plenty to do and see. Cross to the left bank and up the stairs to top of bridge the turn right through the water tunnel to further ruins of the aqueduct system. Make sure you visit the museum and cinema as well.",
          "An amazing piece of Roman engineering that has stood the test of time for around 2000 years. The size and beauty of this monument must be seen first hand to be appreciated. Like most bridges, pictures do not do it justice. You can walk into the area without paying if you do not",
          "You will need at least 4 hours to visit this place if you want to walk on top of the Bridge. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes specially in summer. You can stay over night as there are few hotels by the river. You can go swimming by the river too, make sure you bring everything",
          "Visited on a day trip from Avignon. Well worth a trip - if travelling from Avignon it can be reached on the A15 bus for just \u20ac1.50 or \u20ac3 return. Journey only takes about 25 minutes and if you leave Avignon on the 8.45 bus you can be back in time for lunch. The entrance fee is",
          "This is a sight well worth a visit. If you have a whole day at your disposal you can bring your swim suits and take a bath in the Gard River, or you can rent a canoe. The Pont du Gard is the highest and one of the best preserved Roman Aqueducts. It was part of a 50 km (31 miles)",
          "My boyfriend and I went to Pont du Gard to take a picture off it. It takes 1 hour from nimes to Pont du Gard on bus. The bus tickets are \u20ac6 for 2 people .We enter the plaza and bought 2 tickets, each one \u20ac8.50 as we walk to the acueduct it only took 1 minute to take a photo and",
          "Very nice and pleasant location. You can do a lot of activities here: sightseeing, rafting, conoeing. The mai problem is the parking at the entrance: it is outrageously expensive!",
          "Ticket gets you in free parking and just priceless views from top to bottom. Cool beach at the bottom so bring your bathing suit, cool off and look up.",
          "Have been here many times before over the years. A long time ago one could park aside of the bridge for nothing, it was quiet then. Now it is exploited as a touristic attraction with high parking prices, but.... I would not have missed to see it another time, it is so",
          "Can't help but be impressed by this massive structure and wonder how it could be built in those days. Can very well make a day of it by swimming or khayaking in the crystal clear waters. Great spot for families.",
          "Photos really don't do it justice. Entrance well laid out & easy to access. Bring your swimming gear!",
          "always impressive. seriously recommend following some of the paths on the south side to see the next three smaller remains as the water course runs its track through the hills behind - 30-40 mins max to get back to the bridge. There is good swimming in river below, but watch out",
          "This is a must see. The museum - visitor center is very informative and well done. Be prepared that it is a good walk from the center to the actual aquaduct. There are several types of tours, each one allows you subsequently higher access to the structure. If you have the",
          "Lots of comments here about the high price of admission. It's a rare and popular tourist attraction with a great museum--I'd expect to pay a premium. I'm sorry we were too late for the guided tours but we had a very long walk around. We arrived by bicycle, locked them up and set",
          "First of all, don't get me wrong, this an outstanding Unesco site of historical significance. It is located alongside a slow moving river where literally hundreds of people, families etc enjoy the beautiful out doors, swimming and canoeing. There is also a fantastic restaurant",
          "A classic example of brilliant Roman engineering. This is the remaining and largest span of a 50 kilometer aqueduct that brought water from Uzes to Nimes. Stunning to see this marvel spans a wide river valley. Many walking trails on each side to amazing views. Places to swim",
          "A good afternoon out - a very hot day, and lots to see. Good visitors centre, but we were eager to get out and see the real thing - it didn't disappoint. In scorching weather, we were very jealous of the bathers in the river. On a cooler day, would have taken more advantage",
          "Obviously the Pont du Gard is beautiful and well worth a visit BUT don't get ripped off. Unless you want to go to the museum and exhibition (on the left hand side, where tickets are needed) go to the right hand side and it's free to just walk over the Pont Du Gard - you don't",
          "The aqueduct is stunning and it's worth getting your feet wet to get the photo you want. Similarly a climb to the viewpoints is essential. Museum is hopeless as too dark, badly designed and not presented in any logical order. All exhibits modern reproductions with no original",
          "This is a large tourist attraction; the ancient bridge built by the Romans as part of the 50km long aqueduct they built. To view the size of this 150 tall bridge across the Gard river is impressive. However, take quite a bit of time to walk over to the museum. It is",
          "Easy to find with pleanty of parking. Bring your own picnic and spend an afternoon or a whole day at this historic monument. Swim in the river, take some photos, viist the many gift shops, have some lunch, take some photos, have a great day.",
          "Where else can you find an aqueduct/bridge built around 40-60AD that you can walk over? This UNESCO site is a joy to visit. Don't miss the museum/cultural center located on the far side of the bridge. There is even an interactive children's wing where kids can see how life was",
          "Being the honest British traveller we turned up to the ticket office and asked what was required as we only had time to visit the Aquaduct or 'Monument' as they call it. Dutifully we paid for 2 tickets. Well layer out site and plenty of space even when busy. However as we didn't",
          "Magnificent Aquaduct one has to see if interested in Roman history or architecture. The best view is from the hill side, so you don't see the added footbridge. The (necessary) organisation around this attraction is impressive but not intrusive.",
          "A must see if combining your understanding of Roman history in the area. Also go to Castellum Aquae to see where the water ends up in Nimes. It is spectacular and very pictureque.",
          "This is a must do. An ancient aqueduct built 2,000 years ago. Just imagine the planning and labour that went into its construction. We visited the museum and spent the day swimming. We were there in the height of tourist season but everything was very accessible. We also",
          "Put simply, this is indeed something genuinely mind-blowing, both in terms of how they built it and also the sheer spectacle it is to behold up close. Make sure you book the tour across the top tier that carried the water. Easy to get to by car or bus (B21 from Nimes).",
          "Great place to visit with a very impressive Roman ruin and wonderful hiking trails all around the aqueduct. Also wonderful to go swimming in the river below.",
          "Always amazed by the architectural power and the determination of the Romans to build anything they wanted. Be prepared to spend at least half a day or more if you like hiking and nature. There are short trails around the structure. The river under the aqueduct provided a place",
          "Well worth a visit. The Pont du Gard is stunning and so well preserved. You can access via the left or right bank. Entry includes parking and a. Is it to the museum which was well worth it. The river below is good for canoeing and swimming. You could easily spend a day there .",
          "This place is amazing. It's crazy to think that something built so long ago still stands. We had a great tour guide who pointed out lots of interesting facts including that someone laid on of the arches on the aqueduct backwards. When the stones were originally made they were",
          "A very interesting place to visit, the exhibition and film was very informative and the Pont du Gard was extremely impressive! What a feat of Roman engineering! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We have visited the Pont du Gard on numerous occasions. It is one of those places you have to visit if you are in the area. It does get very busying August and at weekends. There is a nice walk around the \"M\u00e9moires de Garrigue\" which has some shaded areas and is less busy than",
          "If you can spare the time, be sure to take your 'suit' and enjoy a swim during your visit. Truly enjoy with the locals. The structure is sooo impressive based on the age and the resources avaiydurong the construction Take note of the incredibly old olive trees along the path.",
          "Simply stunning & incredible. Very well preserved Roman Aqueduct that worth the visit. Th side ans sights of the aqueduct are very nice ! We spent almost a full day there to relax. It's even possible to swim in the river a at the food of the aqueduct. Do not forget your camera",
          "fantastic historic aquaduc and very well reserved. we also had a swim in the river (not crossing the bridge but right side of it). Fantastic first impression at parking was a bit negative. Why pay if we inly want to see and swim but happy we did it. beautiful spot and very",
          "This is a must not miss attraction in France. The Pont du Gard is just an amazing day trip and very relaxing. I visited on a sunny day and it was beautiful. The bridge itself is breath taking as well as the river flowing through.",
          "Remarkable testament to the ingenious Roman architects and the resilience of the old in the face of the new. Well deserved as a Unesco World Heritage site. Wear good shoes and take water and immerse yourself in the space that has been so well designed and cared for by the",
          "This truly is a remarkable site - and sight. We visited on a hot and sunny day so were able to take plenty of photographs of a wonderful monument.",
          "The 1st century Roman aqueduct is simply stunning. No trip to the region is complete without visiting Pont du Gard. The introductory film, with sub-captions, is essential before your stroll out to the site. You can view the aqueduct from above and below stream, and from river",
          "This Roman equaduct, is an impresive architecture. very well reserved, lots of information to learn about. Wondeerful on a warm day, can take a swim in teh rever below.",
          "Sensible footwear needed to get the best from this. A bit of a walk but the reward is worth it. Sunny day so we had a paddle in the lovely clear water .View of the bridge-aqueduct amazing , very well preserved. Restaurant and cafe to get either a snack or full meal. We had a",
          "I am originally from Nimes, just near by this 2000 years old Roman Aquaduc, so this is obviously not the first time I visit the site. However, this was the first time since they commercialized the access, and it does take a bit away from what it was originally. It also, therefor",
          "This place is absolutely horrible. Don't go! This museum has an entirely crazy and I am sure also illegal parking system. We entered the parking area expecting to have a peek at Pont du Gard (which we had just sailed under in canoes). This was not possible without entering the",
          "Definitely very impressive. 2000 y.o monument. awesome and very beautiful. worth a visit despite the ticket.",
          "What an amazing engineering feat and more amazing how this structure is still standing. The upper view from the visitor entrance side is better for photos than from the opposite side (stairs going up). BTW: We didn't have time to check out how it works, but the river below is a",
          "I last visited this monument about 30 years ago. Back then you could walk on the monument and see the water channel. Now that's only accessible to people who buy an expensive pass that's only available in limited quantities. Only being able to stand on the neighbouring",
          "Add to the thousands of reviews something new is difficult, so I'll tell you about the practical part of the trip. If you travel by yourself, drive up to the bridge from the northern side - from Vers- Pont-du-Gard. A little further, but much less people and much cheaper. The",

        "wiki": "The city of Montpellier in southern France has a large number of noteworthy historic h\u00f4tels particuliers (in English: mansions), in its old centre. These h\u00f4tels are listed on this page with a short description. Most of them were built during the period that Montpellier was capital of the Languedoc, under the reign of King Louis XIV.\n\n\n== H\u00f4tels ==\n\nH\u00f4tel Baudon de Mauny Built in 1777 incorporating earlier Gothic elements, with a flowery fa\u00e7ade in Louis XVI style.\nH\u00f4tel Sabatier d'Espeyran 19th century example of a Second Empire h\u00f4tel\nH\u00f4tel de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s Built between 1723 and 1730 by architect Jean Giral, for the then mayor of Montpellier, Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nH\u00f4tel de Manse Late 17th century. Home of the Count of Manse, also treasurer to the King of France. The interior fa\u00e7ade was designed by Italian artists.\nH\u00f4tel Richer de Belleval This h\u00f4tel was built for Charles de Boulhaco in 1676, incorporating fragments from previous buildings on the site. In 1692, Georges Richer de Belleval took over residence. In 1816 the building was acquired by the city to serve as the town hall. It is located on the Place de la Canourgue, facing the H\u00f4tel de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s.\nH\u00f4tel de St-C\u00f4me The building is now used as the  Chamber of Commerce. Built between 1752 and 1756, by Jean Giral. The h\u00f4tel was built with money bequeathed to the surgeons of Montpellier by Fran\u00e7ois Gigot de la Peyronie, surgeon of Louis XV, so they could have an anatomical theatre which remains inside. In 1792, it was closed in the turmoil of the French Revolution.\nH\u00f4tel du Sarret From 1636, nicknamed Maison de la Coquille or 'shell house'.\nH\u00f4tel de Solas Early 17th century, with a noteworthy porch ceiling.\nH\u00f4tel des Tr\u00e9soriers de France Jacques Coeur, treasurer of the French king, lived in this h\u00f4tel from its construction in 1432. He had the mansion's vaulted cellars and coffered ceilings built. In 1675, it was bought by the Tr\u00e9soriers de France, an administrative body in charge of the royal estates in Languedoc, who added the impressive staircase and fa\u00e7ade. It is also known under the name of Lunaret, after Henri de Lunaret who bequeathed the h\u00f4tel to the city of Montpellier. The building now houses the Mus\u00e9e Languedocien.\nH\u00f4tel des Tr\u00e9soriers de la Bourse by Jean Giral. The building has two courtyards with a grand open staircase. Also known as the H\u00f4tel Rodez-Benavent.\nH\u00f4tel d'Uston 18th century, with exuberant decoration consisting of wreaths and cherubs.\nH\u00f4tel de Varennes Originally medieval, renovated and fa\u00e7ade added in the 18th century. The interior consists of several rooms with gothic rib vaults and ancient romanesque columns from a church previously located here. The 14th century Salle P\u00e9trarque is the official reception hall of the city of Montpellier.\nH\u00f4tel de la Vieille Intendance Home of the sociologist Auguste Comte and the writer Paul Val\u00e9ry.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Aigues-Mortes (French pronunciation: \u200b[\u025b\u0261m\u0254\u0281t]; Occitan: Aigas M\u00f2rtas) is a French  commune in the Gard department in the Occitanie region of southern France.  The medieval city walls surrounding the city are well preserved. Situated on the junction of the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te and the Chenal Maritime to Grau du Roy, the town is a favoured stop for canal craft and Dutch barges.\n\n\n=== Toponymy ===\nThe name \"Aigues-Mortes\" was attested  in 1248 in the Latinized form Aquae Mortuae, which means \"dead water\", or \"stagnant water\".  The name comes from the marshes and ponds that surround the village (which has never had potable water). The inhabitants of the commune are known as Aigues-Mortais or Aigues-Mortaises.The Occitan Aigas Mortas is equivalent to toponymic types in the Morteau Oil dialect cf. Morteau (Doubs): mortua Aqua (1105, VTF521) and Morteaue (Haute-Marne): mortua Aqua (1163, VTF521). Grau du Roy in French means \"pond of the King\". In Occitan, grau means \"pond with extension\". \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe foundation of the city is said to have been by Gaius Marius, around 102BC but there is no documentary evidence to support this.\nA Roman by the name of Peccius fitted out the first salt marsh and gave his name to the Marsh of Peccais. Salt mining started from the Neolithic period and was continued in the Hellenistic period, but the ancient uses of saline have not resulted in any major archaeological discovery. It is likely that any remains were destroyed by modern saline facilities.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 791, Charlemagne erected the Mataf\u00e8re Tower amid the swamps for the safety of fishermen and salt workers. Some argue that the signaling and transmission of news was not foreign to the building of this tower which was designed to give warning in case of arrival of a fleet, as for the Magne Tower at N\u00eemes.\nThe purpose of this tower was part of the war plan and spiritual plan which Charlemagne granted at the Benedictine abbey, dedicated to Opus Dei (work of God) and whose incessant chanting, day and night, was to designate the convent as Psalmody or Psalmodi. This monastery still existed in 812, as confirmed by an act of endowment made by the Badila from N\u00eemes at the abbey.At that time, the people lived in reed huts and made their living from fishing, hunting, and salt production from several small salt marshes along the sea shore. The region was then under the rule of the monks from the Abbey of Psalmody.\nIn 1240, Louis IX, who wanted to get rid of the dependency on the Italian maritime republics for transporting troops to the Crusades, focused on the strategic position of his kingdom. At that time, Marseille belonged to his brother Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, Agde, Count of Toulouse, and Montpellier, and King of Aragon. Louis IX wanted direct access to the Mediterranean Sea. He obtained the town and the surrounding lands by exchange of properties with the monks of the abbey. Residents were exempt from the salt tax which was previously levied so that they could now take the salt unconstrained.He built a road between the marshes and built the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower to serve as a watchtower and protect access to the city. Saint-Louis then built the Constance Tower on the site of the old Mataf\u00e8re Tower, to house the garrison. In 1272, his son and successor, Philip III the Bold, ordered the continuation of the construction of walls to completely encircle the small town. The work would not be completed for another 30 years.\nThis was the city from which Louis IX twice departed for the Crusades: the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and again for the Eighth Crusade in 1270 for Tunis where he died of dysentery.\nThe year 1270 has been established, mistakenly for many historians, as the last step of a process initiated at the end of the 11th century. The judgment is hasty because the transfer of crusaders or mercenaries from the harbour of Aigues-Mortes continued after this year. The order given in 1275 to Sir Guillaume de Roussillon by Philip III the Bold and Pope Gregory X after the Council of Lyons in 1274 to reinforce Saint-Jean d'Acre in the East shows that maritime activity continued for a ninth crusade which never took place.There is a popular belief that the sea reached Aigues-Mortes in 1270. In fact, as confirmed by studies of the engineer Charles Leon Dombre, the whole of Aigues-Mortes, including the port itself, was in the Marette pond, the Canal-Viel and Grau Louis, the Canal Viel being the access channel to the sea. The Grau-Louis was approximately at the modern location of La Grande-Motte.\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, Philip the Fair used the fortified site to incarcerate the Templars. Between 8 and 11 November 1307, forty-five of them were put to the question, found guilty, and held prisoner in the Tower of Constance.\n\n\n=== Modern and contemporary periods ===\nAigues-Mortes still retained its privileges granted by the kings. Curiously it was a great Protestant in the person of Jean d'Harambure \"the One-Eyed\", light horse commander of King Henry IV and former governor of Vend\u00f4me who would be appointed governor of Aigues-Mortes and the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower on 4 September 1607. To do this, he took an oath before the Constable of France Henri de Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, who was a Catholic and supported the rival Adrien de Chanmont, the Lord of Berich\u00e8re. The conflict continued until 1612, and Harambure, supported by the pastors of Lower Languedoc and the inhabitants, finished it by a personal appeal to the Queen. He eventually resigned on 27 February 1615 in favour of his son Jean d'Harambure, but King Louis XIII restored him for six years. On 27 July 1616 he resigned again in favour of Gaspard III de Coligny, but not without obtaining a token of appreciation for the judges and consuls of the city.\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, important works were being undertaken to facilitate access to Aigues-Mortes from the sea. The old Grau-Louis, dug for the Crusades, was replaced by the Grau-de-la-Croisette and a port was dug at the base of the Tower of Constance. It lost its importance from 1481 when Provence and Marseille were attached to the kingdom of France. Only the exploitation of the Peccais salt marshes encouraged Fran\u00e7ois I, in 1532, to connect the salt industry of Aigues-Mortes to the sea. This channel, said Grau-Henry, silted up in turn. The opening, in 1752, of the Grau-du-Roi solved the problem for a while. A final solution was found in 1806 by connecting the Aigues-Mortes river port through the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFrom 1575 to 1622, Aigues-Mortes was one of the eight safe havens granted to the Protestants. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused severe repression of Protestantism, which was marked in Languedoc and the C\u00e9vennes in the early 18th century by the Camisard War. Like other towers in the town, from 1686 onwards, the Constance Tower was used as a prison for the Huguenots who refused to convert to Roman Catholicism. In 1703, Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards, managed to escape with sixteen companions.During the French Revolution, the city was called Port-Pelletier. At that time the port had almost disappeared due to silting, induced by the intensification of labour in the watershed at the same time as the clearing of woods and forests following the abolition of privileges. The decline of forest cover led to soil erosion and consequently a greater quantity of alluvial deposits in the ports of the region. Thus, in 1804 the prefect \"Mr. de Barante p\u00e8re\" wrote in a report that: \"The coasts of this department are more prone to silting ... The ports of Maguelonne and Aigues Mortes and the old port of Cette no longer exist except in history\" he alerted: \"An inordinate desire to collect and multiply these forest clearings since 1790 ... Greed has devoured in a few years the resource of the future, the mountains, opened to the plough, show that soon naked and barren rock, each groove becoming a ravine; the topsoil, driven by storms, has been brought into the rivers, and thence into the lower parts, where it serves every day to find the lowest parts and the darkest swamps.\"\n\n\n=== The massacre of Italians (August 1893) ===\n\nIn the summer of 1893, the Compagnie des Salins du Midi launched a recruiting campaign for workers for the threshing and the lifting of salt. Hiring was reduced due to the economic crisis that hit Europe, so the prospect of finding a seasonal job was attractive in this year and there were a greater number of workers looking for work. These were divided into three categories nicknamed:\n\n\"Ard\u00e8che\" peasants, not necessarily native to Ard\u00e8che, who leave their land at this time of the season;\n\"Piedmontese\" consisting of Italians from throughout northern Italy and locally recruited by team leaders: the chefs du colle;\n\"tramps\" composed mainly of vagabonds.Because of the recruitment operated by Compagnie des Salins du Midi, the chefs de colle were forced to compose teams including both French and Italians. In the early morning of 16 August 1893 a fight broke out between the two communities that quickly turned into a struggle of honour. Despite the intervention of the justice of the peace and the police, the situation rapidly degenerated. Some tramps met in Aigues-Mortes and, saying that Italians had killed some Aiguemortais, swelled the ranks of the population and of people who had not managed to find employment. A group of Italians was then attacked and tried to take refuge in a bakery that rioters wanted to burn. The prefect called for troops at 4am, but they did not arrive on the scene until 18 hours after the drama.Early in the morning, the situation escalated and the rioters moved to the Peccais saltfields where there were the largest number of Italians. Police Captain Cabley, trying to provide protection, promised the rioters to hunt the Italians and escort them to the Aigues-Mortes Police Station. It was during the journey that the Italians attacked by the rioters were massacred by a crowd that the police were unable to contain. There were seven dead and fifty wounded, some of whom had lifelong consequences. This was the largest massacre of immigrants in the modern history of France and also one of the biggest scandals in its judicial history because no condemnation was ever pronounced.\nThe case became a diplomatic issue and the transalpine (Italian) foreign press took up the cause of the Italians. There were Anti-French riots in Italy. A diplomatic solution was found and the parties were compensated while the nationalist mayor Marius Terras was forced to resign.A theatrical play by Serge Valletti called Dirty August is based on the tragic events.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAigues-Mortes is located in the Petite Camargue some 90 km (56 miles) northwest of Marseille.  By road, Aigues-Mortes is about 33 km (21 miles) southwest of N\u00eemes, and 20 km (12 miles) east of Montpellier in a direct line. Access to the commune is by route D979 coming south from Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze to Aigues-Mortes town. Route D979 continues southwest through the commune to Le Grau-du-Roi. Route D62 also starts from Aigues-Mortes heading southwest parallel to D979 before turning eastwards and forming part of the southern border of the commune. Route D62A continues to Plan d'Eau du Vidourie.\nThe commune is composed of a portion of the wet plains and lakes of the Petite Camargue. It is separated from the Gulf of Lions (and, thus, the Mediterranean) by the town of Le Grau-du-Roi, however Aigues-Mortes is connected to the sea through the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te. There is only one other hamlet in the commune called Mas de Jarras Listel on the western border.\nThe Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te enters the commune from the northwest and the northeast in two branches from the main canal to the north and the branches intersect in the town of Aigues-Mortes before exiting as a single canal alongside route D979 and feeding into the Mediterranean Sea at Le Grau-du-Roi.A rail branch line from N\u00eemes passes through Aigues-Mortes from north-east to south-west, with a station in the town of Aigues-Mortes, to its terminus on the coast at Le-Grau-du-Roi.  This line also transports sea salt.\nThe communes of Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze and Le Grau-du-Roi are adjacent to the town of Aigues-Mortes. Its inhabitants are called Aigues-Mortais or Aigues-Mortise; in Occitan they are aigamortencs.\nAigues-Mortes is one of 79 member communes of the Sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale (SCoT) of South Gard and is also one of 34 communes in the Pays Vidourle-Camargue. Aigues-Mortes is one of the four communes of the Loi littoral of SCoT in the South of Gard.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nViticulture and asparagus\nBreeding of bulls and of Camargue horses. Both are raised almost wild in the surrounding marshes.The Camargue bull is smaller than the Spanish fighting bulls, stocky, with high horns and head. It measures about 1.40 m at the withers. It is primarily intended for bullfighting which is very popular in the region.\nThe Camargue horse is the ultimate companion for herdsmen to move into the marshes and herd bulls. According to some discoveries of bones, it seems that the ancestors of the Camargue horse date to the Quaternary period. The Camargue horse is not very large, about 1.50 m tall. It has a huge resistance adapted to the terrain. Its colour is brown at birth, gradually turning white after a few years.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nProduction of salt by the operation of the saltworks of the Salins group. Probably used since ancient times, the salt of Aigues-Mortes attracted fishermen and salt workers. The Benedictine monks settled nearby in the 8th century at the Abbey of Psalmodiet to exploit this valuable commodity in the Peccais Ponds. The salt has long been one of the main resources of the city. To achieve \"table salt quality\", water pumped from the sea travels more than 70 km in \"roubines\". The concentration of sodium chloride is from 29 to more than 260 g/kilo. Mechanically harvested salt is piled up in the twinkling \"camelles\" before being packaged. It is suitable for human consumption.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe medieval heritage from the 13th and 14th centuries of the commune and its proximity to the sea attract many tourists and residents of France.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== River ===\nThe city of Aigues-Mortes is a crossroads of canals:\n\nCanal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te from the north-east and leaving westward\nCanal de Bourgidou to the southeast, and joins the Petit Rh\u00f4ne via other channels to the limit of Gard and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne\nLe Grau-du-Roi, maintained since the Middle Ages and connecting Aigues-Mortes to the central part of Grau-du-Roi\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nThe Line N\u00eemes to Le Grau-du-Roi serves the towns and villages of Costi\u00e8res and the coastline, with a terminus at Le Grau-du-Roi. It is also used for the transport of salt produced by the saltworks of the Salins Group (see link below).\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe development of seaside tourism since the 1960s was marked by the construction of new resorts (La Grande-Motte) and the extension of existing facilities from Le Grau du Roi to Port-Camargue. To facilitate access to tourists, a coastal road network has been augmented and connected to the A9 motorway. Aigues-Mortes benefits in these ways:\n\nto the east, the road D58 connects the city to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and the commune of Arles. This road winds through the rice fields and the various ponds that make up the Camargue.\nto the west, the road D62 was enlarged for cars to make a quick connection to Montpellier\nto the north, the road D979 directly connects the town to the motorway at Gallargues-le-MontueuxThe bus 106 also connects Montpellier and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Municipal Administration ===\nThe municipal council consists of 29 members including the mayor, 8 deputies, and 20 municipal councilors.\nSince the last municipal elections, its composition is as follows:\n\nList of Successive Mayors of Aigues-Mortes\n\nMayors from 1944(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe town is the capital of the canton of the same name whose general counsel is Leopold Rosso, deputy mayor of Le Grau-du-Roi and president of the Community of Communes Terre de Camargue (UMP). The canton is part of the arrondissement of N\u00eemes and the second electoral district of Gard where the member is Gilbert Collard (FN ).\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Distribution of age groups ===\nThe distribution of the population of the municipality by age group is as follows:\n\n47.6% of men (0\u201314 years = 17.7%, 15\u201329 years = 17.1%, 30\u201344 years = 22%, 45 to 59 years = 21.1% over 60 years = 22%)\n52.4% of women (0\u201319 years = 16.9%, 15\u201329 years = 15.1%, 30\u201344 years = 23.5%, 45\u201359 years = 19.9%, more than 60 years = 24.5%)The female population is over-represented compared to men. The rate of (52.4%) is substantially the same as the national rate (51.8%).\nPercentage Distribution of Age Groups in Aigues-Mortes and Gard Department in 2007\n\n\n== Local Culture ==\n\n\n=== The Aigues-Mortes Fougasse ===\nFougasse was one of the first pastries which could rise. It can be sweet (sometimes called \"tarte au sucre\" or sugar tart) or salty (with or without gratillons).\nTraditionally, making sweet fougasse in Aigues-Mortes was reserved for the Christmas period, as part of the Thirteen desserts. Based on a brioche dough, sugar, butter, and orange blossom, it was made by the baker with ingredients provided by the client. Now Aigues-Mortes fougasse sells all year.\n\n\n=== Lou Drap\u00e9 ===\nLou Drap\u00e9 is an imaginary horse mentioned in local folklore, which was supposed to walk at night around the ramparts of the city and take 50 to 100 children on his back, and disappear to \"nowhere\".\n\n\n== Historical sites ==\nAigues-Mortes has a very large number of sites registered as historical monuments.\n\n\n=== The Tower of Constance and the ramparts ===\n\nThe Tower of Constance was built in 1242 by Saint-Louis on the former site of the Mataf\u00e8re Tower which was built by Charlemagne around 790AD to house the king's garrison. The construction was completed in 1254.\nIt is 22 metres in diameter with a height of either 33 or 40 metres depending on the source. The thickness of the walls at the base is 6 metres.\nOn the ground floor, there is a guardroom protected by a portcullis. In the middle of the room, there is a circular opening leading to the cellar which served as a pantry, storage of ammunition as well as for dungeons. These areas were called the \"culs de basse fosse\", an old way of saying underground dungeons in French.\nOn the first floor, there is the knight's hall. Structurally it is similar to the guardroom. It was in this room that the Protestants were imprisoned during the 18th century, most notably Marie Durand, who engraved the word \"r\u00e9sister\" (English: resist) into the edge of the well which can be seen to this day. She was imprisoned at the age of 15, and was freed 38 years later, along with political prisoners such as Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards.\nBetween these two rooms, a narrow, covered way was built within the walls to keep watch on the room below.\nAfter the knight's hall, there is an entrance to the terrace which offers a wide panoramic view of the region, making it an ideal position for surveillance.  Sometimes, the prisoners were allowed to go on the terrace to get some fresh air.\nThe ramparts stretch for a distance of 1650 metres.\nSpectacular in their height and their state of preservation even though they were not restored in the 19th century, as was Carcassonne for example, they remain in a well preserved state. Along with the Tower of Constance, they are a testimony to Western European military architecture in the marshlands during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Carbonni\u00e8re Tower ===\n\nLocated in the commune of Saint-Laurent-d'Aigouze, the Carbonni\u00e8re Tower was first referred to in an old text from 1346 specifying the function of the structure. It said, \"this fortress is the key to the kingdom in this region.\" Surrounded by salt marshes, the fortress was the only passageway into Aigues-Mortes. It was guarded by a garrison made up of a ch\u00e2telain and several guards. From the terrace, which could support up to four cannons, there is a panoramic view of Petite Camargue.\n\n\n=== The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons ===\nThe Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons is a Gothic-style church and was probably built before the ramparts in the mid-13th century during the time of Saint-Louis. In 1537 it served as a Collegiate church but was later vandalized by Protestants in 1575. After the reconstruction of the bell tower in 1634 it later served as a Temple of Reason during the French Revolution, a barracks, grain merchant, and a salt warehouse. It was re-established as a place of worship in 1804 and the building was restored in the neo classical-baroque style. Between 1964 and 1967 all of the 19th century decor was removed, notably the coffered ceilings, resulting in the much more basic and medieval style church we see today. Since 1991, the stained-glass windows by Claude Viallat, a contemporary artist belonging to the \"Supports/Surfaces\" art movement, add extraordinary light and colour to the building.  With the exception of a few statues, the rest of the 18th and 19th century furniture disappeared during this period. The fa\u00e7ade is crowned by a simple bell-gable housing 3 bells. The largest of the three is 1.07 metres in diameter. It was dated to 1740, cast by master smelter Jean Poutingon, and has been designated a historical monument of France. The church also houses a statue of Saint-Louis.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Chapel of the Gray Penitents ===\nThe Chapel of the Gray Penitents is located to the east of the Place de la Viguerie. It is the property of the Brotherhood of Grey Penitents established in 1400. The facade is in the style of Louis XIV. The entrance door is from the 17th century and is decorated with a wooden statue. The altarpiece was carved in 1687 by Sabatier.\nInside, an altarpiece represents the passion of Christ. It was built of gray stucco plaster in 1687 by the sculptor Sabatier from Montpellier. This altar, on which are the arms of the brotherhood, occupies the back of the choir.\n\n\n=== The Chapel of the White Penitents ===\nThe Chapel of the White Penitents is located at the corner of the Rue de la R\u00e9publique and Rue Louis Blanc. It belongs to the Brotherhood of the White Penitents which was created in 1622.\nAbove the choir, on the roof, there is a copy of the Retable of Jerusalem where Christ celebrated the Passover and Holy Thursday with his apostles. Around the high altar, a painting on canvas traces the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It is attributed to Xavier Sigalon a painter born in Uz\u00e8s in 1778 . On each side of the choir stand two statues: on the left Saint Felix for the redemption of captives, on the right James, son of Alphaeus, first Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\n\n=== Saint-Louis Square ===\n\nThis is the touristic heart of the city. In the centre, opposite the main entrance of the Porte de la Gardette, stands the statue of Saint-Louis, the work of James Pradier in 1849.\n\n\n=== Plan des Theatres ===\nThe Plan des Theatres are arenas for the Camargue bullfights. They were listed in 1993 on the inventory of the list of Historic Monuments (MH) for their ethnological and cultural interest. They can accommodate more than 600 people.\n\n\n== Aerial Views ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Literary references ===\nErnest Hemingway's third major posthumous work, the novel The Garden of Eden, takes place in Aigues-Mortes.\nWayne Koestenbaum set his 2004 novel Moira Orfei in Aigues-Mortes in Aigues Mortes.\nMichael Moorcock's Hawkmoon novels feature Aigues Mortes as the site of Castle Brass and capital city of a futuristic \"Kamarg\".\nGiovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron, Second Day, Seventh Story, as the place the king's daughter was shipwrecked in her false explanation of her four-year absence.\n\n\n== Notable people linked to the commune ==\nEmmanuel Theaulon, playwright, born in Aigues-Mortes on 14 August 1787.\nMichel M\u00e9zy, former footballer, born in Aigues-Mortes on 15 August 1948.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, one of the founders of Impressionism, represented Aigues-Mortes in one of his paintings.\nMaurice Fontaine, former senator and mayor.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the Gard department\nList of works by James Pradier Statue of Saint Louis\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simien, Aigues-Mortes, \u00e9ditions Alan Sutton, 2006.

        "wiki": "Montpellier Rotunda is a Grade I listed building in Montpellier, Cheltenham, England.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1809, Henry Thompson constructed a wooden pavilion with a colonnade as part of the wider dvelopment of the \"Montpellier Spa\" on land previously known as Trafalgar Field. By 1817 it had been rebuilt in stone as the Montpellier Spa became increasingly popular. Thompson employed the architect George Allen Underwood, who completed the building with a statue of a crouching lion on the parapet.In 1826, Henry Thompson's son Pearson Thompson asked John Buonarotti Papworth to oversee the project and it was during this period that the dome was erected. The dome is inspired by Rome's Pantheon and has almost identical proportions. The building was used as a pumproom, with water from local wells, and ballroom with an additional billiard room and reading room.Concerts were held in the building including Jenny Lind in 1848 and the first performance of Scherzo by Gustav Holst in 1891.The Spa and surronding gardens were purchaed by the Chltenham Borough Council in 1893. The building was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1955. During the 1960s the council and Lloyds Bank undertook restoration work.\n\nSince 2017 it has housed a restaurant belonging to the Ivy Collection, a group of UK restaurants, who undertook restoration work.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building has limestone walls with a copper roof. The front of the building has a colonnade of doric columns, a frieze of alternating square and rectangular panels and a parapet. The central wooden dome in the assembly room is coffered internally and has light entering via the lantern in the centre. The room is 56 feet (17 m) high and 54 feet (16 m) across.\n\n\n== References ==",

(1999) in Physical chemistry from Ecole Normale Superieure, France, and a Ph.D. (2003) from the University Toulouse III, France, under the supervision of Bruno Chaudret, with a dissertation on the magnetism of clusters.  In 2003 he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley with Prof. Peidong Yang, investigating the  diluted magnetic semiconducting nanowires. Between 2004 and 2009 he was a senior lecturer at Montpellier 2 University, France, and in 2009 he joined the Department of Chemistry at Bar-Ilan University (BIU) where he is currently an associate professor and a member of the Bar-Ilan Institute for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials (BINA). Zitoun is also a member of the Israel National Research Center for Electrochemical Propulsion (INREP) and an associate editor of the Journal of Nanoparticle Research.\n\n\n== Scientific interests and publications ==\nHis current research focuses on the investigation of the chemical synthesis of materials to promote renewable and green energies. Zitoun's lab has a high expertise in the wet synthesis of Nano-scale materials with the accent on the transition metals, their complexes, organometallic, metallic, and metal-oxide compounds. He developed new chemical routes using soluble organometallic or metal-organic precursors as an alternative to conventional colloidal chemistry and gas phase thin film deposition. The nanomaterials exhibit high activity for electrocatalysis in alkaline medium. Zitoun and colleagues were the first to introduce the use of electron magnetic measurements in post-mortem analyses of Li-ion batteries and the first group to publish the operando electron magnetic measurements. These in-situ measurements allowed proposing a new electrochemical mechanism for the high energy density anodic materials.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDavid Zitoun is married to Keren Zitoun, a pharmacist with a thesis in music therapy. They repatriated to Israel in 2009 and have four children.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "N\u00eemes ( NEEM, French: [nim] (listen); Occitan: Nimes [\u02c8nimes]; Latin: Nemausus) is the prefecture of the Gard department in the Occitanie region of Southern France. Located between the Mediterranean Sea and C\u00e9vennes, the commune of N\u00eemes has an estimated population of 151,001 (2016).Dubbed the most Roman city outside Italy, N\u00eemes has a rich history dating back to the Roman Empire when the city was a regional capital, and home to 50,000\u201360,000 people. Several famous monuments are in N\u00eemes, such as the Arena of N\u00eemes and the Maison Carr\u00e9e. Because of this, N\u00eemes is often referred to as the French Rome.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe site on which the built-up area of N\u00eemes has become established in the course of centuries is part of the edge of the alluvial plain of the Vistrenque River which butts up against low hills: to the northeast, Mont Duplan; to the southwest, Montaury; to the west, Mt. Cavalier and the knoll of Canteduc.\nIts name appears in inscriptions in Gaulish as dede matrebo Namausikabo = \"he has given to the mothers of N\u00eemes\" and \"toutios Namausatis\" = \"citizen of N\u00eemes\".Nemausus was the god of the local Volcae Arecomici tribe. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 4000\u20132000 BC ===\nThe Neolithic site of Serre Paradis reveals the presence of semi-nomadic cultivators in the period 4000 to 3500 BC on the site of N\u00eemes.The menhir of Courbessac (or La Poudri\u00e8re) stands in a field, near the airstrip. This limestone monolith of over two metres in height dates to about 2500 BC, and is considered the oldest monument of N\u00eemes.\n\n\n=== 1800\u2013600 BC ===\nThe Bronze Age has left traces of villages that were made out of huts and branches. The population of the site increased during the Bronze Age.\n\n\n=== 600\u2013121 BC ===\nThe hill of Mt. Cavalier was the site of the early oppidum which gave birth to the city. During the third and 2nd centuries BC a surrounding wall was built with a dry-stone tower at the summit which was later incorporated into the Tour Magne. The Volcae Arecomici people settled around the spring at the foot of Mount Cavalier and build a sanctuary to Nemausus there.\nThe Warrior of Grezan is considered to be the most ancient indigenous sculpture in southern Gaul.In 123 BC the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus campaigned against Gallic tribes in the area and defeated the Allobroges and the Arverni, while the Volcae offered no resistance. The Roman province Gallia Transalpina was established in 121 BC and from 118 BC the Via Domitia was built through the later site of the city.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nThe city arose on the important Via Domitia which connected Italy with Hispania.\nN\u00eemes became a Roman colony as Colonia Nemausus sometime before 28 BC, as witnessed by the earliest coins, which bear the abbreviation NEM. COL, \"Colony of Nemausus\". Veterans of Julius Caesar's legions in his Nile campaigns were given plots of land to cultivate on the plain of N\u00eemes.Augustus started a major building program in the city, as elswhere in the empire. He also gave the town a ring of ramparts 6 km (3.7 miles) long, reinforced by 14 towers; two gates remain today: the Porta Augusta and the Porte de France.\nThe Maison Carr\u00e9e dating from the late 1st c. BC is one of the best-preserved temples to be found anywhere in the former Roman Empire, and appears to be almost totally intact.\nThe great Nimes Aqueduct, many of whose remains can be seen today outside of the city, was built to bring water from the hills to the north. Where it crossed the River Gard between Uz\u00e8s and Remoulins, the spectacular Pont du Gard was built. This is 20 km (12 mi) north east of the city.  \nThe museum contains many fine objects including mosaic floors, frescoes and sculpture from rich houses and buildings found in excavations in and near the city. It is known that the town had a civil basilica, a curia, a gymnasium and perhaps a circus. The amphitheatre is very well preserved, dates from the end of the 2nd century and was one of the largest amphitheatres in the Empire. The so-called Temple of Diana dating from Augustus and rebuilt in the 2nd century was not a temple but was centred on a nymphaeum located within the Fontaine Sanctuary dedicated to Augustus and may have been a library.\nThe city was the birthplace of the family of emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161).\nEmperor Constantine (306-337) endowed the city with baths.\nIt became the seat of the Diocesan Vicar, the chief administrative officer of southern Gaul.\nThe town was prosperous until the end of the 3rd century when successive barbarian invasions slowed its development. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the nearby town of Arles enjoyed more prosperity. In the early 5th century the Praetorian Prefecture was moved from Trier in northeast Gaul to Arles.The Visigoths captured the city in 472.\n\n\n==== Finds from Roman Nimes in the Mus\u00e9e de la Romanit\u00e9 ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 4th\u201313th centuries ===\nAfter the Roman period the Christian Church, already established in Gaul since the 1st century AD, appeared to be the last refuge of classical civilisation, as it was organised and directed by a series of Gallo-Roman aristocrats. When the Visigoths were accepted into the Roman Empire, N\u00eemes was included in their territory in 472, even after the Frankish victory at the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 (507). The urban landscape went through transformation with the Goths, but much of the heritage of the Roman era remained largely intact.\nBy 725, the Muslim Umayyads had conquered the whole Visigothic territory of Septimania including N\u00eemes. In 736\u2013737, Charles Martel and his brother led an expedition to Septimania and Provence, and largely destroyed the city (in the hands of Umayyads allied with the local Gallo-Roman and Gothic nobility), including the amphitheatre, thereafter heading back north. The Muslim government came to an end in 752, when Pepin the Short captured the city. In 754, an uprising took place against the Carolingian king, but was put down, and count Radulf, a Frank, appointed as master of the city. After the events connected with the war, N\u00eemes was now only a shadow of the opulent Roman city it had once been. The local authorities installed themselves in the remains of the amphitheatre.\nCarolingian rule brought relative peace, but feudal times in the 12th century brought local troubles, which lasted until the days of St. Louis. During that period N\u00eemes was jointly administered by a lay power resident in the old amphitheatre, where lived the Viguier and the Knights of the Arena, and the religious power based in the Bishop's palace complex, around the cathedral, its chapter and the Bishop's house; meanwhile the city was represented by four Consuls, who sat in the Maison Carr\u00e9e.\nDespite incessant feudal squabbling, N\u00eemes saw some progress both in commerce and industry as well as in stock-breeding and associated activities.\nAfter the last effort by Raymond VII of Toulouse, St. Louis managed to establish royal power in the region which became Languedoc. N\u00eemes thus finally came into the hands of the King of France.\n\n\n=== Period of invasions ===\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries the Rhone Valley underwent an uninterrupted series of invasions which ruined the economy and caused famine. Customs were forgotten, religious troubles developed (see French Wars of Religion) and epidemics, all of which affected the city. N\u00eemes, which was one of the Protestant strongholds, felt the full force of repression and fratricidal confrontations (including the Michelade massacre) which continued until the middle of the 17th century, adding to the misery of periodic outbreaks of plague.\n\n\n=== 17th century to the French Revolution ===\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century N\u00eemes experienced a period of prosperity. Population growth caused the town to expand, and slum housing to be replaced. To this period also belong the reconstruction of Notre-Dame-Saint-Castor, the Bishop's palace and numerous mansions (h\u00f4tels). This renaissance strengthened the manufacturing and industrial potential of the city, the population rising from 21,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\nIn this same period the Fountain gardens, the Quais de la Fontaine, were laid out, the areas surrounding the Maison Carr\u00e9e and the Amphitheatre were cleared of encroachments, whilst the entire population benefited from the atmosphere of prosperity.\n\n\n=== From the French Revolution to the present ===\nFollowing a European economic crisis that hit N\u00eemes with full force, the Revolutionary period awoke the slumbering demons of political and religious antagonism. The White Terror added to natural calamities and economic recession, produced murder, pillage and arson until 1815. Order was however restored in the course of the century, and N\u00eemes became the metropolis of Bas-Languedoc, diversifying its industry into new kinds of activity. At the same time the surrounding countryside adapted to market needs and shared in the general increase of wealth.\nDuring the Second World War, the Maquis resistance fighters Jean Robert and Vinicio Fa\u00efta were executed at N\u00eemes on 22 April 1943. The N\u00eemes marshalling yards were bombed by American bombers in 1944.\nThe 2\u00ba R\u00e9giment \u00c9tranger d'Infanterie (2\u00baREI), the main motorised infantry regiment of the French Foreign Legion, has been garrisoned in N\u00eemes since November 1983.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nN\u00eemes is one of the warmest cities in France. The city has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), being wetter than a typical Mediterranean climate, especially for its moderately rainy summers. It's slightly inland, southerly location results in hot air over the city during summer months, temperatures above 34 \u00b0C are common in July and August, whereas winters are cool but not cold. Night temps under 0 \u00b0C are common from December to February, while snowfall occurs every year.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nSeveral important remains of the Roman Empire can still be seen in and around N\u00eemes:\n\nThe elliptical Roman amphitheatre, of the 1st or 2nd century AD, is the best-preserved Roman arena in France. It was filled with medieval housing, when its walls served as ramparts, but they were cleared under Napoleon. It is still used as a bull fighting and concert arena.\nThe Maison Carr\u00e9e (Square House), a small Roman temple dedicated to sons of Agrippa was built c. 19 BC. It is one of the best-preserved Roman temples anywhere. Visitors can watch a short film about the history of N\u00eemes inside.\nThe 18th-century Jardins de la Fontaine (Gardens of the Fountain) built around the Roman thermae ruins.\nThe nearby Pont du Gard, also built by Agrippa, is a well-preserved aqueduct that used to carry water across the small Gardon river valley.\nThe nearby Mont Cavalier is crowned by the Tour Magne (\"Great Tower\"), a ruined Roman tower.Later monuments include:\n\nThe cathedral (dedicated to Saint Castor of Apt, a native of the city), occupying, it is believed, the site of the temple of Augustus, is partly Romanesque and partly Gothic in style.\nThe Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de N\u00eemesThere is modern architecture at N\u00eemes too: Norman Foster conceived the  Carr\u00e9 d'art (1986), a museum of modern art and mediatheque, and Jean Nouvel designed the Nemausus, a post-modern residential ensemble.\nTree-shaded boulevards trace the foundations of its former city walls.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nN\u00eemes is historically known for its textiles. Denim, the fabric of blue jeans, derives its name from this city (Serge de N\u00eemes).\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of N\u00eemes increased from 128,471 in 1990 to 146,709 in 2012, yet the biggest growth the city ever experienced happened in 1968, with a growth of +23.5% compared to 1962.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nFrom 1810 to 1822, Joseph Gergonne published a scientific journal specializing in mathematics from N\u00eemes called Annales de Gergonne.\nThe asteroid 51 Nemausa was named after N\u00eemes, where it was discovered in 1858.\nTwo times per year, N\u00eemes hosts one of the main French bullfighting events, Feria de N\u00eemes (festival), and several hundreds of thousands gather in the streets.\nIn 2005 Rammstein filmed their #1 live Album V\u00f6lkerball in N\u00eemes, and are returning in 2017.\nMetallica's live DVD Fran\u00e7ais Pour une Nuit (English: French for One Night) was recorded in N\u00eemes, France, in the Arena of N\u00eemes on 7 July 2009, during the World Magnetic Tour.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nN\u00eemes-Al\u00e8s-Camargue-C\u00e9vennes Airport serves the city. The Gare de N\u00eemes is the central railway station, offering connections to Paris (high-speed rail), Marseille, Montpellier, Narbonne, Toulouse, Perpignan, Figueras and Barcelona in Spain and several regional destinations. The motorway A9 connects N\u00eemes with Orange, Montpellier, Narbonne, and Perpignan, the A54 with Arles and Salon-de-Provence.\nWork is almost complete on the construction of a high-speed TGV line, Contournement N\u00eemes \u2013 Montpellier bypassing N\u00eemes and Montpellier with the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.The new line opened to passenger service on 15 December 2019 together with a new TGV station at NIMES-PONT DU GARD, (a confusing name as it located some 12km from the city itself and 20km from the Pont du Gard).A new station is also to be opened at the same time on the existing route between N\u00ecmes and Avignon, thus providing connections between the new line and local rail service.\nN\u00eemes bus station is adjacent to the city centre railway station. Buses connect the city with nearby towns and villages not served by rail. https://www.laregion.fr/transports-gard-regulier\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe association football club N\u00eemes Olympique who has recently achieved promotion to Ligue 1 is based in N\u00eemes.\nWorld Archery Indoor World Cup takes place in N\u00eemes each year in mid January\nThe local rugby union team is RC N\u00eemes.\nThere is a professional volleyball team located here.\nOlympic swimming champion Yannick Agnel was born in N\u00eemes.\nThe city hosted the opening stages of the 2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cycling race.\n\n\n== Mayors ==\n\u00c9mile Jourdan, PCF (1965\u20131983)\nJean Bousquet, UDF (1983\u20131995)\nAlain Clary, PCF (1995\u20132001)\nJean-Paul Fournier, LR (since 2001)\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nN\u00eemes is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nCosti\u00e8res de N\u00eemes AOC\nCommunes of the Gard department\nCouncils of N\u00eemes\nFeria de N\u00eemes\nList of works by James Pradier\nThe works of Maxime Real del Sarte\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Nismes\", A Handbook for Travellers in France (8th ed.), London: J.

We can bought the Arles ticket online and visit here before following Vincent\u2019foot steps. \n\nInside the amphitheater, you can have a vision of what happened long time ago....Gladiators died with great honor.",
          "Very nice area, stopped on the way to Barcelona, and was very positively impressed by the old town.",
          "Meow! While there\u2019s not much left, I enjoyed walking around the ruins and seeing up close the eroded marble. I watched the video explaining the original build and theatre experience - wow! I also climbed and jumped from stone to stone, showing off my ninja cat skills. Small, short visit. Five paws \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e",
          "It is the most popular site in the Earl, which has been awarded the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. Some say that Earl's Amphitheater, built in 90 AD, is prettier than the Colosseum of Rome. At the time, it could seat some 20,000 \u2026",
          "The building measures 136 m (446 ft) in length and 109 m (358 ft) wide, and features 120 arches. It has an oval arena surrounded by terraces, arcades on two levels (60 in all), bleachers, a system of galleries, drainage system in many \u2026",
          "Monument with some sweet little kittens. 9 Euros entrance fee but with lots of reductions. Great experience!",
          "Had an opportunity to visit and to enjoy the bull races. This is not to be confused with bull fighting. In the races the bull is king as he chases the young men around the arena. They try to get close enough to snag some ribbons from \u2026",
          "An amazing Roman amphitheater worth seeing. They've installed modern bleachers, I assume to accommodate people for performances. It sort of takes away from the historical feel of the place, but it is still cool.",
          "Awesome. Unfortunately I visited on the hottest day of the year in France (during a heatwave) so was, I'm afraid, more interested in an ice cold beer under the umbrellas of the bar opposite!",
          "A bit expensive (full price 9\u20ac, discount 7\u20ac) but it is a splendid and almost 2000 years old monument. The tower part where we can climb it to the top has been restored but really fit with the rest. We can go all along inside on the \u2026",
          "Old Roman amphitheater, very interesting to walk through. It is used for events currently as well, so had some clearly modern additions. There is a cost to enter.",

          "As a location, this was definitely awesome. Super historic structure with a lot of character. The only things to keep in mind is to many bring a pillow (the stone seats are pretty hard, as expected) and also try and get your seat on the side of the arena opposite of the sun.",
          "The present day structure has been the subject of much degradation and restoration over the years but still remains a tribute to ancient building craft. Of all the remains in Arles to visit I would place the Amphitheatre at the top of the \u2026",
          "We had a wonderful guide who made it come alive. The visit was free and extremely enjoyable.",
          "The caves themselves were impressive, my review is based purely on my guided experience. The whole thing was conducted in French and I don't speak any. Was promised there will be explanations in English but there was none, so I missed out on the history and facts as well as things go look out for. Should do better.",
          "Very impressive. My first amphitheatre. Partly restored it is very interesting but a little disappointed at the scaffold type modern seating inside but I guess it's a working theatre so it must be necessary. Definitely worth a visit and especially so because of the artists who have frequented this area.",
          "Beautiful historical theatre, stone building in circle shape. The theatre originally had no female actor, all actors must male.",
          "Nice place with pretty decent view over the city of Arles. Entrance fee also includes access to the roman theater (which is a bit of a let down unfortunately). Some of the information on the signs is available in English if your French is \u2026",
          "Wonderful location but\nNo guides \nNo audio guides\nOnly little panel without any translation into English (only a little 5-lines summary in Englush in comparison with 3 panels in French)\n\nOf course you can forget explainations in other languages (I.e. Italian, even if 90% of the tourists were Italians!)",

          "If you stop by Arles, I highly recommend you  to visit the Arena. It's really beautiful and you can feel the old and ancient history of the cjty as soon as you pass by. The arena is really close to the city center and within walking distance from the river.",
          "Such a good place. An intact Roman amphitheatre. The playing chicken with the bulls was good entertainment too. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is an almost perfectly preserved roman amphitheatre in the centre of the old town of Arles which is still used for bullfights and concerts. Just round the corner from it you can visit the antique theatre and also the Roman baths of emperor Constantine and the modern museum of art reattu",
          "It looks more of a building site(modern seating and scaffolding surrounds entire arena)",
          "A really cool place, would recommend to see as you can tell there is a lot of history here. Has a great view from the top and I would love to watch a show there sometime. I wish they kept more of the olden style of stands rather than the more modern look it has. Overall a great place to see if your in the area.",

          "Not the best visit. We spent the day in Arles and I regretted it. The neighborhoods are a little shady and the Colosseum wasn't the best. If we came back, we wouldn't be stopping here again. Better to spend the day in Avignon",
          "Incredible place! Visit it and feel the power of Ancient Rome, imagine gladiator fights and 20.000 people watching agitated their fights; imagine Van Gogh wandering there and watching bull fights that \u201cinspired\u201d him to cut off his ear.",
          "Terrific Arena.  Hike to top to get great views of the city.",
          "A mini 2000 year old Roman Colliseum that has impressive internal architecture. Bloodless bullfight festival occurs during the summer with athletes competing to grab the ribbon off the bull to receive a prize.",
          "Good for pics outside. I didn't feel the need to go in.",
          "Spoilt by the seating and the fact that bull fighting is still a thing",
          "Arles is just an amazing place....go there when you can",
          "Interesting and generally well preserved considering 2000 years old, but spoilt by modern steel structure to achieve more seating for events.",
          "Well preserved Roman amphitheatre in southern France. Well worth the entrance fee which also covers some, less impressive, Roman ruins.",
          "A great Roman ruins in this picturesque town. The town of Arles is a great place to visit and the amphitheatre is a must see. It is very well preserved from the outside and is surrounded by beautiful buildings typical of the south of \u2026",
          "Like a small Coliseum.  It was a lovely town and would love to see a concert there and definitely want to go back someday!",
          "Amphitheatre in the middle of town, impressive edifice. Also see the cafe where Van Gogh painted the street scene",
          "interesting place definitely for a recommendation",
          "It's nice stroll around the amphitheatre and to take a few pictures and good exercise.",
          "A gorgeous monument that holds history of multiple events, from gladiator fights to once holding a small town within. There aren't many restrictions as to where you can go, and the highlight are certainly the towers that provide a \u2026",
          "Fantastic old Roman City. Centre of Old Roman Empire",
          "Amazing building with an almost 2000 year history. Must see!!! A little minus, but an understandable use for it, is the inner steel construction for the bull fighting arena (don't be shocked, southern French bull fights have nothing to do with the Spanish deadly ones, no animal is harmed or hurt)",
          "It was all very interesting and the bull racing in the evening was quite spectacular",
          "Pretty location with interesting information, but I think the price to enter the amphitheatre itself is quite steep considering the size. Still definitely worth walking around the exterior and enjoying the views.",
          "Very small town but well worth the visit especially if you're interested in history. We didn't spend nearly the amount of time there that I would like to have spent. Definitely will spend more time there if I get to visit South France again.",
          "Great Roman site, well preserved and great fun to explore.",
          "Seen one amphitheatre, you've seen them all but impressive every time.",
          "Great value \"liberty\" ticket.  4 sites and a museum for \u20ac12.",
          "Nice Roman Amphitheatre. Glad to see it is used today.",
          "Facade is amazing although indoors is not great. Used as a bull ring and very little to learn on the inside. Enjoy the outside and save your \u20acuros as there is little if anything to see. The tower has good views.",
          "This arena was pretty interesting. 9 euros for the area and neighboring ancient theatre. There are a few plaques for the arena that outline some of the history and the long term to restore the building. Architecture is amazing to see but \u2026",
          "Well preserved Roman monument!",
          "Was fantastic to see. Especially knowing more about the history of it",
          "Great spent hours here",
          "Fantastic trip back in time in a well preserved and functional Roman Arena.  We enjoyed watching the gentle \"non kill\" Bull Fights there in the afternoon.  Highly recommended experience.",
          "Just saw grom the outside. But it\u2018s a impressive very old building.",
          "They said it was free under 18 years old, but the cachier than said that its only free with adult, when we got our teacher, they already set the conditions to be it a parent. Then the teacher went for a fight, but they couldnt speak \u2026",
          "Having just visited the amphitheatre in Nimes, this amphitheatre I felt was not as visitor friendly. Still a wonderful visit.",
          "A cute and cozy Roman anphitheatre in the middle of a city.  Today, this is known to be a private place, hosting private events and, it is also used as a bullfights ring (sadly!) \nNice very old building, most of the original architecture is still there.",
          "The Arles Amphitheatre has nothing the Roman Colosseum didn't have except for the smaller size and the 4 towers. It is still used today for concerts and bullfights. It is an amazing structure if like history or arquitecture. We visited it \u2026",
          "Cool to bring back the Roman amphitheatre. Fun to see how it worked back in the day",
          "Amazing relic from Roman time.",
          "If you like Roman amphitheatres  this will not disappoint. Even watched school children learning to sword fight.",
          "Smaller version of the colosseum but not as crowded!",
          "wonderful surprise! however could be more taken care",
          "Beautiful piece of history and very impressive to see!",
          "I loved it here! Beautiful, cool and spectacular!",
          "Impressive but a pity all the scaffolding is still everywhere",
          "Nice to be able to wander freely throughout the Arena. Bonus was that the day we went (5 pm on a Saturday in June) there was hardly anyone there. Amazing to think of the history of the place, and even more amazing that it is still used for events!",
          "A beautiful setting and fabulous chance to see the intersection of ancient Rome and modern day Arles.",
          "I was actually pleasantly surprised by how amazing this amphitheatre was. I\u2019m the sort of person who gets bored after walking around old building and museums for too long, but if you go with a friend, it\u2019s really great! It kept us in the shade and there was a lovely view from the top of this ancient place.",
          "How are you going to go to oral and not visit the amphitheater it's right there it's so big and it's so much fun to walk around and take pictures highly recommended",
          "An amazing piece of Roman Architecture still standing!",
          "Fascinating place. Wonderful views from the tower.",
          "Managed to catch a performance of gladiators here along with our visit. There was a lengthy introduction which was a shame that i could not understand fully it but it was very visceral and quite believable.  The kids loved it!",
          "Amazing place....history from 500years before Christ....Amazing history with this town..",
          "Beautiful and very quite place. What i like about this place that there are not many tourist here and hence you can really enjoy the place. Although the amphitheater is closed due go construction work so you cant really go inside as of now. \u2026",
          "This place was awesome! It was the highlight of the trip. The owners are very nice, and welcoming. They have kept the Chateau very authentic. Do go to the zoo down the road.",
          "This is a place where you can see the traces of ancient Rome. It may have been an honor in the past, but now it's a quiet place of feeling.",
          "Great ancient structure!",
          "A nice site with Roman ruins of a theater. Ok to visit if you buy the combined pass, otherwise may not be worth the entry fee. Most of the site can be seen through the fence. Getting inside gets you a little closer, and adds a nice movie \u2026",
          "An impressive Roman amphitheatre partly reconstructed. Entry tickets are reasonably priced and an audio guide is available. Large and uneven stairs are needed to be climbed to access some areas. This is a very impressive structure and should be visited.",
          "Arles is worth visiting, once will not be enough",
          "Excellent visit right in the centre of Arles, well maintained with good access.",
          "Didn't actually go in the amphitheatre - just around the outside.",
          "Verry beatiful place.",
          "Great day and atmosphere!",
          "Managed to catch a performance of gladiators here along with our visit. There was a lengthy introduction which was a shame that i could not understand fully it but it was very visceral and quite believable.  The kids loved it!",

          "Wonderful old Roman Arena.",
          "A Roman amphitheater where gladiators fought.  Now in partial runs.  Events are now held here.",

          "The history is amazing, and the views from the top are fabulous!",
          "A smaller Roman Amphitheater very nice",
          "Excellent building \u20ac13 entry per person. The cafe at the bottom of the steps serves very good food.",
          "Very impressive but too much steel is used for reconstruction. Nice view of the city from the top tower.",
          "Seriously cool spot.\n\nIt's arguably the best preserved amphitheater in the world and is still in use.  The only draw back is that the modern aluminum seating takes away from the beauty of it but is is amazing to walk around and see just what these were like exactly.",
          "Great place to visit",
          "Pitty about all the steal seating on inside, it spoils any photos opps.",
          "Incredible structure still in great shape after millennia",
          "Brilliant.  Spend money and restore some sections to original.",
          "It is a Coliseum where it is one of the biggest and the area is pretty.",
          "Very nice!",
          "Combo ticket when purchased at the arena first.  The amphitheater is close by too.  Both sites are well kept, clean bathrooms and friendly informative staff.  We visited on a perfect day, feeling the Provence winds atop the arena.",
          "Arles is worth at least a whole day to explore. Go where the tourists aren't.",
          "A Unesco world heritage site. We'll worth any detour. Still in full use today, for camargaise bull sport, two millenia after it was first built. It is an integral part of the town. Houses come within yards. Nothing false, artificial or \u2026",
          "Beautiful place! Picture worthy!",
          "Got to see a 1000 year old olive tree",
          "Here you have the chance to see the Roman influence in Southern France. It's a great Amphitheatre, and you can climb up the stairs to the top, so you can see the whole town.",
          "Much reconstructed over the years but - perhaps because of the works - absolutely jaw dropping. Amazing!",
          "Wonderful Roman town. Easy to negotiate traffic & visit all sites in this small town",
          "An interesting place. There is enough of it left to get a feel for what it was like in Roman times. It was extremely hot on the day we went and there is no shade in the arena.",
          "Roman colisuem used today for \"French\" Bulldog Fighting, well preserved because of continuous use. Clean and daily tours are free.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "An impressive and imposing piece of Roman Imperial architecture, in a space well preserved by the city so that it can be well admired.",

          "Superb site and nicely preserved",
          "Must  spare half a day.",
          "You can buy either a solo ticket or a pass for 4 monuments and 2 museums in Arles for just 9 \u20ac (ask for a discount if you stay in a hotel or airbnb in Arles). There is a nice view from top of the tower and the walk around the giant arcades is interesting. We were here in early March and we were the only people inside the whole arena.",
          "Beautiful Roman amphitheater!  We were fortunate enough to be here during a festival weekend when they had bull-fighting.  Lots of fun!!  It is definitely worth visiting to see how this 2,000 year old structure has survived the ages.",
          "Excellent guided tour in English",
          "Nice Palace, finding a right parking place is a nightmare.",
          "Fantastic roman building",
          "Very well preserved arena in the middle of the town.",
          "Amazing - Lots of history, even after the Romans. Arles is a great town too!",
          "Stayed right here and loved it.",
          "A little housekeeping effort is required.  Hard to believe placed is used for bull flights today!!",
          "An impressive and pretty well-preserved building. Must-see if you're in the area.\n\nIt's too bad that I visited this in the middle of a heatwave, and couldn't really spend time on the inside at all because of the scorching sun, which the rest of the town mostly managed to provide shelter from.",
          "...its pretty average. Go to Coliseum",
          "No information available inside and no signs to explain what the different areas below the seating were used for. Very impressive none the less.",
          "roman arena, extraordinarily well preserved, still in use for shows after more than 2000 years",
          "Arles is a nice place, with long history...roman amphitheater used today for bullfight but with happyend for the bulls, and other events",
          "Beautifully preserved ancient ruin and well worth a look.",
          "It's an absolutely wonderful historical place from Roman era.",
          "Interesting stop along the way. Expect to spend about 2 hours in town.",
          "Interesting although I wish they didn't have modern seating inside.  Still if that is the price to maintain it then I suppose it's a good trade off.  Great views of the Rhone from the tower.",
          "Great site to visit",
          "Fascinating amphitheatre, nice view",
          "Huge and well preserved than other similar buildings",

          "Very beautiful place, but I didn't go inside. Big ang majestic.",
          "Very well maintained and impressive. Still used for many shows and bullfights, but can also be visited on other days. Great for kids too",
          "Nice amfitheater with interesting history.",
          "Amphlitheatre and Arena. Nicer then Nimes. Much better views of the old Roman city and the modern architecture of the new Arles. Well worth the trip. The Van Gogh walk is worth the day to see how much the city has changed and yet stayed the same since Vincent's time.",
          "Large amount of the amphitheatre still stands today, and in fact, it is still actively used for bull fighting.",
          "Very good, make sure you go to the tower for views.",

          "A smaller version of the Colosseum in Rome",
          "It's worth going out of you way to see it.",
          "Beautiful Roman amphitheatre. It is however not that impressive as the one in Oranges. It is rather small and lacks the surrounding wall like the one in Oranges.",
          "It was kind of neat, but not worth 9 Euros per person in my opinion. Bull fights are still held here, so the modern bleachers take away from how cool it could potentially have been to visit.",
          "Remains of Roman Amphitheater, partly rebuilt. Excellent example of an amphitheater.",
          "Excellent tour in english. It covered the history of Arles and the details of the amphitheatre.",

          "Stunning sense of history",
          "It's very worthy visiting this Rome architecture. It has good view to see Arles and also you can enjoy the sunshine sitting inside. The entry fee is \u20ac8 for adult and \u20ac6 for reduction. If you visit Arles, you must visit here!",
          "Very pleasant and great to walk around.  Interesting how it is used to host functions within the site.",
          "An amazing example of a Roman amphitheatre, the most compete that I have ever seen.  A shame it is not possible to enter the amphitheatre to get an impression of its size and also a shame about the scaffolding like seating, but probably good to see that it is still being put to good use.",
          "Well preserved site of Roman antiquity, well worth a visit to soak up the atmosphere, either as a sight-seer or attending a performance.",
          "The gladiator show was given only on French.  But when we bought the tickets nobody told us anything. That's unacceptable!!!",
          "Well worth seeing.  This Roman amphitheater is still used for events like corrida and bullfights",
          "One of my favourite towns in France, so much to see.",
          "The atmosphere--wonderful",
          "The outer concentric corridors are what make this structure so beautiful. Some areas, where the stone is a bleached sand colour, give you the feeling of walking inside the skeleton of a mammoth beast.",
          "Well preserved ground",
          "They tried to copy the Arena di Verona but they failed",
          "They close the gate 40 minutes before the scheduled closing time.",
          "Magic Seite, in the Center of a small medevial town. A must see.",
          "beautiful - I didn't go inside but I walked around- amazing spot!",
          "Wonderful Place to visit. Hope i Will come back..",
          "I'm a sucker for Roman ruins, and am looking forward to the day when I get to actually hear a concert in one the still used arenes or amphitheaters (Pula, Nimes, here) - so far I've missed them all by one or two days (early or late)... Arles is cool because it has both a well-conserved amphitheater and colosseum...",
          "Stunning antique. Really worth going in to fully appreciate size and age. 2000 years old and still in use!",
          "Well worth a visit. They still have shows there although I suspect with much less blodd letting.  Lots of modern seating retro fitted in which was disappointing but they have to pay for maintenance somehow. ",
          "Wonderful",
          "When you will go inside and seat near the arena, you can imagine the gladiators, in front of you...",
          "The history!   Very cool site",

          "Nice Roman Arena still in use.",
          "Do it with the pass. Amazing building",
          "Truly impressive 1st century construction, but it doesn't take much time to see it all. It is a better bet to buy one of the combo tickets that gives you access to multiple sights in Arles rather than just paying for this.",
          "Impressively big. Great to be able to walk all over the place.",
          "Great Roman amphitheater and it still is in use! Go here for gladiator fights, horse shows and bull fighting (th French way, the bull is not harmed) \nSit on the right side if you want shade. ",
          "Didn't go inside but an amazing looking place. We'll restored.",
          "Well preserved amphitheatre.    It is similar to the colisseum in rome, but less crowded.   It has a beautiful view of the town if you climb tothe top.",

          "Arles \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udfdb\ud83d\udc8f go there its a must go to place.",
          "Great place to visit when the weather is nice. If there is no event going on then a 30 minute visit is more than enough.",
          "Very impressive, very nice village",
          "Well preserved and still used today.  One of the best examples in Europe",

          "Amazing and fabulous town for a visit.",
          "Ok",

          "Very impressive, it is also a great protection for a rainstorm.",
          "Both the amphitheatre and antic theatre are worth the visit. Take a 5 entry ticket at the tourist office and visit at least these two places. A beautiful view from the top of the tower.",
          "Very good",
          "You can see Courses camarguaises (different from bull fight) Mon/Wed/Fri 5:30 pm.  It is fun to watch bull vs raseteurs.  You can also visit the Arles dueling the day and learn about the history of Arles.",

          "If you've never seen a Roman Amphitheatre, then this is one. It's pretty big when you're right next to it. The one in Nimes is more complete, but this one seems to fit in with its surroundings.",
          "stumbled across this quite by chance, really stunning and impressive in a quite unassuming town. Fabulous architecture and really well maintained structure.",
          "It reminded us of the Colosseum in Rome It is very large and comprises terraces and a lot of arcades The Romans knew to entertain people with chariot races and later Arles organized there bullfights Unfortunately now it does not look well maintained..",
          "A mere shadow of its former self, it is still quite impressive! There\u2019s not much to see inside but cool to see how it was used as a walled city in the dark ages!",
          "It is distressing to see how horribly the amphitheatre has been marred by the installation of mass seating complete with metal scaffolding style supports. All ambience and any hope of seeing this as it was historically is lost. Tasteless and ugly.",
          "I didn't take a tour of the amphitheatre but you can get a good idea of what's it about by simply walking around it. Ancient building steeped in history.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Amphitheatre in Arles. We were there just when it opened so it was before the tour groups arrived. It was easy to walk around and read the information we had with us about the Arena. It is an uphill walk to enter up a flight of stairs. It was one of",
          "My wife and I visited this massive Roman site while visiting Arles on a Saturday train day trip from Nimes. We used our Liberty Passport for admission, so entrance cost was low. You get to walk around in the Arena seating, and you get a sense for what a spectacle it must have",
          "So exciting to walk around the arena. You get an idea of what Rome was like at its height. At night it is beautifully lit.",
          "when you are in the region of Arles, you have to visit the arens. They were like slightly destroyed in the middle age, makes it interesting.",
          "First port of call on a River Rhine trip. Very well preserved and atmospheric. Not too expensive either.",
          "This is an archeological site in the historic centre of Arles. It is easily accessible and well preserved and is still in use. The history is well explained on plaques.",
          "Great place - made better by the fact that we happened on to a reconstructed gladiator demonstration in the arena. We visited in great weather. Felt there could have been just a bit better and more creative explanations of the site but it still is pretty cool.",
          "Don't miss the opportunity to see this wonderfully preserved Roman structure. Take your time and walk up the steps right up to the top. The views across Arles are amazing as is the view from the top of the amphitheatre . Then wonder around d the structure and take time to read",
          "We arrived at the start of La Feria. We couldn't get tickets to attend the bullfight in the amphitheatre but could just about see inside and imagine the Roman Emperors in attendance. The noise during the bullfight was deafening. The whole Town was buzzing. Tens of thousands of",
          "This place is amazing especially from a historical perspective. It\u2019s interesting to think the Romans hung out here a century ago. The views over the city are awesome from the top.",
          "This is a huge Roman ampitheater in the center of town and well worth viewing. We only saw it from the outside, but it is possible to walk around the entire perimeter. Check out the little overlook at one end for a great view of the countryside. We couldn't go into the",
          "Having visited the arena at Nimes, we now understand the pride in its \u201cbest preserved\u201d state. But.....this arena in Arles is smaller and seems cosy...comparatively speaking. Built into the hillside, it is quite magnificent and especially the staircase coming up from the lower",
          "Went to Arles to the bullfight and the Feria. Great and friendly ambience with an Spanish touch. Really nice to see the horses parade.",
          "So...you get to look around and go up the tower, there are info boards to read as you go around. It's worth visiting but think with a bit more imagination it could be a lot more informative and better visitor attraction. Still for under 10 Euros per person, you can spend a",
          "Last time here we were fortunate to watch a French bullfight, this time it was fun to describe it all to our friends.",
          "We went by the Arena while on a walking tour of Arles. It is from Roman times built in 90 AD but in good shape and still used today for bull-fighting; not the kind where the animal dies. It is a UNESCO site. Out front there a replica of the famous Van Gogh painting of the",
          "Amazing!! A Must see. It is the most best preserved amphitheatre which hasn\u2019t had any renovation like the one in N\u00eemes. It\u2019s smaller than the one in N\u00eemes but it\u2019s lovely.",
          "The arena is not as impressive as the one in Nimes but despite that it is worth visiting. Interesting history which you can read about on the boards outside & it's still used for bullfighting & festivals.",
          "The huge amphitheater or arena was built as a smaller replica of the Coliseum in Rome with seating for 23,000 people! Well restored as in medieval times around 200 houses had been built inside!",
          "Altough the place is much smaller than the one in Rome you would get the *Gladiator\" feeling being there!",
          "We toured this ruin which has been restored for local events including bull fighting with a professional guide. Our guide covered the construction and history in detail and did a nice talk while we were seated inside the arena about current use for bull fighting. This was a stop",
          "This is a beautifully well preserved Roman relic. I just wish they didn't put the modern stand in it. But it is used for event today so it makes sense. It just detracts from the ambiance.",
          "You can visit this amphitheater for about 15 minutes and be done. There isn\u2019t all that much to see. It\u2019s cool that this amphitheater is still used today, but idk if I\u2019m a fan of the metal bleacher replacements. There are definitely some nice pics to be taken and the view is",
          "If you'r into History, as we are, you'r gonna luv this place. Great restoration work, good explations too. Dogs on a leash should be admited always, tho.",
          "Cost is 9E to get in. A most spectacular building which would have been fabulous in its day. Worth going up to the top for the views",
          "It\u2019s always exciting to see ancient ruins and the amphitheater in Arles did not disappoint. Wherever the Romans went, they built cities that all had the same things, an amphitheater, a circus, a water system and baths. It\u2019s always interesting to visit these sites and see how",
          "My partner and I visited this incredible site in Arles and we both really enjoyed it! It\u2019s a fantastic monument and it\u2019s been very well preserved.",
          "Our Viking tour included a stop at the Amphitheatre and our guide was so knowledgeable about the history, both when it was built and in more modern times. She really made me want to come back and see a bull race or fight.",
          "This place is incredible....because it is still in constant use after so many centuries. We were lucky enough to be here the day of the free annual Prestige Camargue horse show; in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the recognition of the breed of Camargue horses. They are",
          "Beautiful sights all through Arles...the light on the buildings at differ times of the day are incredible..really enjoyed the amphitheater",
          "Our Road Scholar guide told us of the history of this Roman arena. He told of the choice the people made to either save the gladiator who lost the battle, or to slay him. We made a cry to slay him and it rang throughout the arena. The arena is still used a couple of times a year",
          "It isn't just the Amphitheatre, there are other Roman bits. With the ticket for the Arena you can also visit the Theatre. Children are free too. The park below the theatre appears to have an entrance but we found it closed: you need to walk up from the arena and go to the right.",
          "Really enjoyed wondering around here for a while. Partly restored and partly original it is in very good condition and still used today. The 'new' additional seating detracts a little but it's necessary if it to be used. Amazing that something this old can be a functioning",
          "One of the top attractions in Arles, this is a must see. There are interpretative panels in French and English which is good. I climbed the tower and walked around all levels. There weren't too many people there either.",
          "Although not as large as the Rome Colesseum it\u2019s every bit as historical. PLUS, it\u2019s still used today for Bull Fights. But unlike the Bull Fights of yesterday, today that Matador simply must remove a scarf from the Bull\u2019s horns. Just as dangerous for the Matador; not so bad for",
          "It's not too often that you get to see such an ancient Roman relic in such amazing condition. It's beautiful from the outside, but fully functional inside and still used for bullfights, etc. today. It doesn't take long to tour and it's certainly worth it, in my opinion, just to",
          "Great arena,but very busy.The bus tours turned up and hundreds of people were following the paddles all around the arena...inside and outside...where there are more Roman remains. Get there early,as the narrow streets get clogged up with tourists and you can have trouble getting",
          "Arena of Arles looks like the arena of Nimes. Both were built at the end of the I century during the reign of the \"good\" Emperor Hadrian. Both arenas consist of 2 arcades of 60 arches each. The arcades are of different order: the lower Doric, the upper Corinthian. There is a",
          "\u20ac9 entry fee gives you stunning views and a complete self-guided tour of this brilliant arena. There\u2019s very little in English but it\u2019s an amazing place. You can see the whole town from the top by walking round. The scaffolding diminishes things a little but guess it\u2019s needed so",
          "Has been extensively restored and is currently a working arena for bull-fights. There is much modern seating added, which detracts from the allure of the ancient antiquity of this place.",
          "This area has not fallen into the ruins of the coliseum in Rome. With the addition of some metal scaffolding and bleachers, the local people have managed to keep this a functioning area. However, you still get a feel for what is was like 2,000 years ago when the Romans were",
          "You will enjoying climbing the steps for incredible views of Arles and the Rh\u00f4ne River. Hard to fathom life as a gladiator here but this place could help you envision it.",
          "Well preserved arena. For those who have never seen a Roman amphitheatre, the Arles arena is a fine example of yesteryear. The views inside and outside are spectacular!",
          "Fascinating and really interesting. It is quite unbelievable how old this building is, there is plenty of information about the history of it. You are able to walk all around it and can only imagine what it would have been like when it was used as an arena, and also to",
          "During a quick stop in Arles we walked around this impressive structure. It is imposing against the buildings, which are only a few centuries old, that surround this amphitheatre. Cafes and souvenirs stores abound in this area.",
          "Two times, once to enjoy the horses and bulls show, the second for a free visit. The show is magnificent, about two hours with tipical horses, figures of the region, bulls, exercises and stunts. Is a piece of story, like Coliseum, but smaller. My daughter had about 2 years but",
          "We loved this arena so much we made it a point to visit again when we returned to France this year. We bought the Arles Pass and there just happened to be a bull fight going on while we were there. There are 2 types of bullfights, the one we saw was where the bull doesn't get",
          "Still in use today the Roman Arena is an excellent site to visit. Fascinating history thro the ages is described on various information boards. Take the time to wander arount the various levels and passages including the tower.",
          "Outstanding structure that looks like it\u2019s just been cleaned. Used for gladiatorial fights and bullfights. Mostly now for the tourists. Interesting",
          "This is the most complete roman amphitheater in the world and is a must to visit. Take the audio tour and learn just how barbaric the Romans were. Plenty of step climbing involved. Good views from the top.",
          "Magnificent standing specimen of Roman architecture outside Italy. Would have been great to enjoy a spectacle here, but no events while we stayed!",
          "The amphitheatre at Nimes can hold Twenty five thousand we're told Too see the spectacle. It is old. In Roman times brave men bold, Fought each other and animals, sold For entertainment in the same mould As the bull fights today on sand gold Which is regularly raked, scraped",
          "My only negative is that the modern seating for the bull fights obscures the old stone and unlike many amphith\u00e9\u00e2tres you cannot get centre stage.. however it is very impressive and we took lots of photos. Well worth the visit.",
          "Lovely walk around this great monument. Well preserved and offers some great views back across the town of Arles. Well worth the entrance feee of 9 euros.",
          "If you know the film Ronin, then you'll recognise this Arena from those scenes. It's a shame in a way that it's been modernised with scaffolding seating as this detracts from the beauty of the original structure but they have kept it as a functioning arena, so I guess they",
          "Worth a look but all the after market seating spoils the view and atmosphere Historically it is similar to the colosseum and yo can see the replication around Europe",
          "Well-preserved and interesting, the arena is definitely worth a visit. It\u2019s right in the centre of town, where its still impressive structure dominates. There are guided tours, if you are interested in learning more detail about its history. For the best value, I\u2019d recommend",
          "Visited the Amphitheatre shortly after opening and already found 5 guided tours taking place. Impressive ruins and history and still holds events such as bullfighting through the year.",
          "An amazing walk around the inner pathway of the amphitheatre. One can only imagine how difficult and strenuous it was for those who struggled with the huge boulders to create it. You can also go into the seating section of the structure and imagine the pageantry and",
          "We went in the morning on our City Pass and saw there were gladiator fights in the afternoon. The friendly man on the ticket office said our ticket was valid all day so we could come back. We wandered through the galleries and went up the tower. The views were fantastic. (We",

          "Visited Arles and headed for the ar\u00e8nes. Paid entrance and luckily an English guided tour was just about to set off which we joined. Really interesting and leant a lot about the Roman use of the arena. Built 20 years after the Colliseum in Rome. Came back that afternoon for the",
          "An interesting, ancient site built by the Romans, repurposed for events and the fighting of the camarque bulls native to this area. Unlike in Spain, the bulls are not killed. Definitely a must see for history buffs. Well worth a stop.",
          "Well preserved amphitheater from 90 AD. The one in Nimes is larger. They have concerts and bullfights there now.",
          "First came here during the Feria D'Arles in 1998 and fell in love both with the region and the bullfighting experience. Man vs bull has been happening here for 2,000 years and if you've been to the Dordogne, you can see the earliest cave paintings of man's veneration of the bull",
          "This site gives you a glimpse of roman times in Arles. The site is easily accessible. You can buy a ticket that also includes the old theater visit. Once inside, enjoy the views, the old building and the feel of ancient Roman times. Clean washrooms on site. Not a friendly",
          "Having read other reviews, I am left wondering if I missed something at the Amphiteatre of Arles. We visited the Amphitheatre at N\u00eemes two days prevously and we were very disappointed with the Arles Amphitheatre. Firstly, it is full of seating scaffold inside and looks more like",
          "It's difficult to rate something which is clearly a wonderful feat of engineering and construction and still standing 2000 years later but which is rather ruined aesthetically by having scaffolding to support hundreds of extra seats for events taking place today. I guess it is",
          "First time ever i sat and watch a bull fight or more like a show in a Roman amphitheatre. It was amazing to see how well it was managed and is still functional. It is located in a beautiful neighbourhood of the old town. Loved walking around the aisles of markets and restaurants",
          "This beautiful amphitheater dominates Arles. It is well maintained. Climb up the tower to get amazing views of Arles.",
          "You can buy a special pass from the office de tourism that includes a visit to the Arenes and 2 other sites, plus a museum. On specific days in July and August they organize bull fights, horse race or gladiator shows. We attended the gladiators show, it was nice to see as it was",
          "A step back to Roman times with a good view of how life was in those days. We were able to walk around quite freely and had chance to take many photos. It is amazing how much of the original architecture has survived.",
          "We took a guided tour in English and were glad we did. The host was excellent and gave information and insights we would not have had if we simply wandered about. The restored areas really give you a feel of what this place would have been like in the day. Magnificent!",
          "From inside and outside, this was a terrific feat of Roman engineering. We walked all round the galleries from where the views were great. The arena is still used for events, and some version of bullfighting still takes place though apparently the bulls aren't killed but",
          "This must have been quite extraordinary! The arches have survived, but there are places where the floor collapsed, only to gibe you an even more beautiful view of the level below.",
          "The amphitheater is superb. The reconstruction in parts blends in with the real building. The atmosphere is wonderful as you can imagine the actual gladiators in the arena. The toilets are clean and accessible. You can explore the whole amphitheater it\u2019s a must see.",
          "This coliseum is an incredible example of Roman architecture, design and function. Just walking up to it sets one back to what it must have been like in the day when political types entertained the public. Walk in and the towering columns, arches and tunnels add to the",
          "Arles was a place on my bucket list especially visiting the arena and finally got there the other week. Did not disappoint this place is a real must to visit. Not Rome or Ephaseus ( have visited both ) but just a stunning place to visit and tour round. This roman monument just",
          "a wonderfull pure roman heritage.. you deserve to visit it.. and after go to rome. roman made this city unique and you can touch it by vist this piece of their empire as well as the amphitheatre. well done guys. ad maiora.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Smaller than the colosseum in Rome and better situated. Near the other sites too.",
          "Lovely Arena - Very similar to the Colliseum in Rome. It is still used today for Bull Races and other sporting events.",
          "This is a major archeological site dating from Roman times. Unfortunately there are layers of temporary seats on scaffolding around the circumference but at least it is being used. You will marvel at the Roman engineering and the construction of the terraces. Do go to the top",
          "This amphitheater is well preserved and nicely restored in some places. Sure, you will find new scaffolding spectator levels built on top of the remains of the remaining original seats, but once you get inside or over the scaffoldings, you will not notice them much. For good",
          "Absolutely amazing architecture from the 1st century. Quite astonishing engineering and craftsmanship which is still in use today, sadly to torture bulls. Well worth a visit.",
          "This UNESCO World Heritage Site was completely restored a few years ago, it is one of the most wonderfully restored Roman Arena in the world. I\u2019m fortunate to have a house facing this beautiful historical site, I never tire of looking at this architectural masterpiece.",
          "Beautiful amphitheater. Lots of history. There were no lines. You have unlimited access to the entire structure.",
          "We took our time and walked all through the Arena. Very interesting, and well worth an hour of your time to explore it. They still hold bull fights in the arena. We toured the arena and then had a super lunch nearby.",
          "Romans built this theater A.D. 90 which was used for over 4 centuries. Later is was used as a fortress and eventually filled with houses (A.D. 1800). Worth the visit!",
          "We took a tour which i recommend. Held 20,000 spectators at one time. Well restored. Now with bull fights. We saw \"Gladiator school\" for kids while we were there",
          "Very interesting history and structure. You can walk around the tunnels and climb up the tower to look out over the amphitheater and surrounding areas.",
          "Good conditoin, great to walk around, many decks and upper floor view. you can get a combo ticket and save money. Gets you into the Arena also",
          "I guess on a much smaller scale (having not been to Rome yet!), but reminded me of the Colosseum from the outside. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "You would never know about the history of this beautiful place until you walk.Impeccable and i hope it lasts forever",
          "A distinctly Roman arena. They offer re-enactments of Roman era entertainment, although we did not figure out the schedule. Definitely worth the visit. Be sure to climb the tower to get a view of the city.",
          "Saw this remarkable arena with our local guide so it was quite interesting to hear the history of it. The size was very much bigger than expected, as well as the shape it was in.",
          "A must see for the enormity of this beautiful old building (90 AD apparently). An easy walk around Arles",
          "This arena is well worth the visit - you can explore the area at your leisure, sit in the seats, climb partway up one of the towers for a beautiful view. Most of the displays are in French but there is some English translation.",
          "Long history to this site and the story is worth hearing. Fantastic site full of atmosphere - you can taste the history. Generally in great condition and there is no doubt about it - those Romans could build an Arena. To see a concert or bull fight in this place would be \u201cto",
          "I loved walking around les Arenes and imaging the history that has taken place with the Roman influence and sculptured arches",
          "This was a interesting site to visit. It is the remains of an old roman amphitheater and worth going to see. We had a guided tour and one of our stops was here. We only had about 15-20 minutes here and I wish we had more time.",
          "We bought the pass that allowed access to this and other Roman sights in Arles. A money saver Amazing to see an arena built 2000 years ago that is still used today",
          "The remains of this roman amphitheater are interesting and, if you climb the stairs to the tower, provide views of the city. Much of it has been restored over the past several centuries. It is still used for festivals and bull fights which is why there are scaffolding",
          "May Day, May 1, the Festival of The Gardians (French cowboys from the Camargue) was fantastic. An amazing spectacle in a 2,000 year old Roman coliseum, still in use!",
          "Nice example of a Roman Amphitheater. Not as impressive as Ephesus. If you ave not seen one before it is definitely worth a visit. It would be a treat to see a live production if one is on while up are in Arles.",
          "Outstanding arquitectural feat for its time. The arks so perfectly constructed with huge stones and no type of cement. It is unbelievable.",
          "This place is a must do , it is beautiful the fee entrance is 9 euro no senior discounts that included in the price the theatre as well, visiting around take your time going up and down to the highest level to take pictures. Fine piece of architecture.",
          "It is a beautiful Romain arena, well restored . Not really interesting to visit it , just go if you have time .",
          "We bought the city pass and enjoyed our visit to the Arena. It is in good shape although not as good as Nimes. Loved the views from the tower of the city and beyond.",
          "While spending some days to visit Provence we have seen pictures of les arenes. Don\u2019t recommend since although is the highlight of Arles it doesn\u2019t justify a visit.",
          "Even seeing it on a rainy day was no problem because many of the galleries/walkways are covered. OK admission charge.",
          "I note the comments about this being comparable with the Coliseum, but I differ. Although the building from outside is stunning, particularly at nighttime; the internal seating (it is a working space)detracts and distracts. The Roman theatre next door is much better. Get the",
          "If you find yourself in this region, Arles is well worth a few hours walk around. The Amphitheatre and the smaller Theatre Antique are the main draw, \u20ac9 entry for both. Pale in comparison to the Colosseum of Rome, it is still splendid, fully restored, and holds bull fights in",
          "This great example of Roman engineering is a highlight of visiting Arles. Panoramic views of Arles can be had from the towers of the arena. Definitely a must see.",
          "A two-tired Roman Amphitheatre was built in 90AD. It was capable of seating over 20,000 spectators and it was inspired by the Colosseum of Rome. After the fall of Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Amphitheatre was transformed into a fortress and was added four towers. Over",
          "On our way it is worthwhile to stop here and visit this beautiful theatre. Although an entry fee it is managable and offes you a great site. At the exit do not forget to buy the \u20ac 0.- note for \u20ac 2.- ;)",
          "Given it is something approaching 2000 years old and has had several different uses over its life, the amphitheatre at Arles is both is great condition and very impressive. Having visited the Coliseum, the Alres Arena is actually more complete and although much smaller (not",
          "The fact that it still exists is really the main draw for this ancient amphitheater. We toured it in a half and hour and were glad to have seen it but were not blown away.",
          "Did not have the opportunity to enter this arena, much less watch one of bull fights (display?) for the fair, but from the outside, day and night, this location was truly impressive.",
          "This is one of the larger and better preserved of the ancient amphitheatres constructed during the Roman Empire, and is still actively used for bullfights and other entertainment, although my husband facetiously commented that it looked like it was falling apart a bit! Even in",
          "2 days earlier I was at the Amphitheatre in Nimes. Great audio guide, lots of helpful sign, a model, souvenir shop (that actually had some worthwhile books, not just Jenny no), staff who were pleasant, professional and did their jobs well. The Amphitheatre at Arles could not",
          "Arena built by the romand started around 1 AD how good is that. Still used today for festivals and bull fights",
          "Great family activity. And the view from the top level was breath taking. Moderately priced and worth the cost.",
          "Montpellier Toruist Office had little information. Had to establish an account before purchasing seats. Three credit cards refused. When I was called, the agent answered but said they were about to close and I would have to call back in the morning, the day of the event.",
          "It was my first time here I love the city and the arena was super good, good atmosphere I got chance yesterday to see the F\u00e9ria d\u2019Arles. Good experience.",
          "Well preserved structure, built by the Romans in 90 AD, impressive from the outside. The two tiered interior reportedly held up to 20,000 people. Did not enter, as the interior was obscured by metal railings and bleachers set up for the start of the bull fighting season.",
          "This amphitheater build in 148 AD still retains much of its Roman Atmosphere despite its age and past abuses. But it has an overlay of more modern seating, skeletal enough that it does not diminished the experience. We stacked our visit so that we could view the Amphitheaters in",
          "This is Arles main attraction and it is still in use today for bloodless bullfights. It is dead center in the Old Town, so you really can't miss it. While nowhere near as big as the Roman Colliseum, it is a fine example of an amphitheater in the provinces",
          "Medieval cobbled streets and alleyways surrounds this impressive colosseum. The views of Arles and the Rhone river from the top are amazing. There is so much history here, a reminder of the Roman Empire's occupation of France and their incredible medieval architecture. In the",
          "Wonderful history and well preserved amphitheater. Great use of a historic structure. Loved the area around the area too. Well worth it. Get a museum pass. Such a great deal.",
          "The Roman arena is now used to stage bullfights! The cost was a bit steep for the visit \u20ac9.50 although this also included the theatre which was in a bad state of preservation. I believe the theatre in Orange to the north is better preserved.",
          "Among Roman amphitheater\u2019s, this is 20th in size. The most compelling thing is how this has been painstakingly restored over the centuries and is now used. The liberty pass gets you into several monuments and museums for 11 euros. This is definitely worth a look. Sitting in",
          "Very impressive building with amazing views of Arles and the river from the tower. Very good price of 4 monuments for \u20ac12. Definitely go and see this.",
          "Beautiful roman arena constructed with a shiny white stone. To me this arena is a nice as the Colosseo in Rome and much nicer than the one in Verona (Italy).",
          "Rather well preserved Roman amphitheatre, providing pehaps the best view of the town from the top of the two medieval towers inserted at opposite ends of the arena.",
          "The Amphitheatre in Arles France is beautiful, it is one of several of these Roman buildings in the south of France, You can see on this one where they have been repairing it by replacing sections of stone. Which the French have been getting from the same quarry where the Roman",
          "This colosseum is a must see! We were on a tour with Viking River Cruise so I'm not sure if there's a fee or if there's a tour available but it's worth visiting nonetheless. This massive colosseum is in the middle of this quaint French town of Arles just off of the Rhone River.",
          "We visited this to view Bull Fighting Carmargue Style - the bulls do NOT get killed or injured. This was quite an experience and can be recommended if only to see the fitness and energy of the boys/men who tackle speedy and sharp horned bulls. It gives you a chance to sit back",
          "I felt back in time, explanations can be found in place since roman till middle ages , a roman ruins that must be seen",
          "A must see if visiting Arles. A historic site from the times of the Romans. The surrounding area with Roman remains is also interesting.",
          "It is much more fascinating seeing the amphitheatre from outside than from inside. The tribune is almost all covered by the scaffholdings for seatings.",
          "The amphitheater is an imposing structure, and seeing it from the street was impressive. I would have been fine with only looking at it from the outside. A few minutes inside was more than enough for me.",
          "This ancient Roman amphitheater was built in 90 AD. It is still used today for bullfighting, plays, and concerts. It was pretty amazing to be seated on stone that early Romans sat on to cheer on whatever was going on below. This is a must see in Arles.",
          "This Amphiteatre dominates this part of Arles. The interpretive displays under the stands are interesting, but you can't go on the arena floor and access to the stands is limited as well. I though the charge was a bit high for what you got. Fortunately we has visited the",
          "Nice and impressive building-ish with a nice location. I'm not sure if you can normally enter, but the two times I passed by, it was not possible. It's still a nice view and if you happen to be in Arles, you should definitely check it out",
          "We spent a couple of hours viewing the amphitheatre as there is so much to see and the views of the city from the top are spectacular. Not to be missed.",
          "Built about 90 A.D. by the Romans, this amphitheatre held an impressive 20,000+ spectators. It's in good shape and is unusual in that two towers were added on to the top of the structure during the Middle Ages, making it look to me like a gigantic crown set upon the ground.",
          "A visit to the amphitheater in Arles is far more enjoyable than the Colosseum in Rome. It's far more intact (still in use), far less crowded, and much more of the structure is open to visitors. There are even toilets!!",
          "Like lots of things in Arles, you can visit the Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre in a totally unstructured way and explore for yourself. Great views of the town from the top. A grey cat was wandering around the sand of the arena. I guess since the Roman Empire collapsed, they don\u2019t have the budget",
          "In the summer, this version of a bull fight is offered weekly. The bull isn't hurt at all (maybe annoyed) and is the star. The razeteurs (bull fighter) try to capture a ribbon from the bull's forehead, which doesn't sound very macho for either the bull or the razeteur but can",
          "This place is awesome! Hard to believe how complete it is. Excellent side exhibits, too, gladiator costumes, bullfighter costumes, history and photographic displays. It is very \u201cdo at your own pace\u201d, which is so agreeable...no large tour groups tramping through. Although we",
          "Worth to have a stroll in the old town to see the arena. Looks nice even in the evening. N\u00eemes arena is bigger but Arles is also worth seeing.",
          "Having been to see the arena in Nimes the previous day, this was still stunning but a little anticlimactic. It's slightly smaller, and currently appears to be in not such a good state of repair, although it was clear from the many clean and perfect stones that restoration work",
          "This is a very well preserved arena that still functions for bull fights. Go ahead and see the nearby amphitheater that is packaged with the admission ticket. Amazing what those Romans accomplished more than 2,000 years ago.",
          "We stayed within steps of the arena and enjoyed seeing it each time we returned to our home base. The entire arena is accessible to visitors and the history is fascinating.",
          "step back in time to when matadors fought bulls well worth a visit and the shops in the area are cool too",
          "It is a great Romans place but it is smaller than the similar one in Nimes. Inside is simple and still can be used.",
          "I've seen several amphitheatres before in various countries and this is up there with the best. It's still being used for concerts and plays but unfortunately non were scheduled for when we were there but our local guide goes regularly. A little taste of the Romans in Provence!",
          "So many people have gone into detail on this... Suffice it to say that it is a don't - miss sight, and since it is one of the five major things in town, and the biggest, you will head there anyway.",
          "I am always amazed by the scale of Roman architecture and engineering. The fact that they pulled it off on this scale without the benefit of modern machinery makes it alone worth the visit!",
          "Really cool to think that this very arena was used 2,000 years ago and is still in use today (obviously with some repairs). Much of the foundation of the Arena is original. They conduct \"humane\" bull fighting in the arena today. Not sure of Summer schedule, but last bull",
          "Go to the top of the one tower that faces the Rh\u00f4ne and you will get spectacular views of the city and the Rh\u00f4ne.",
          "Awesome to see that the Amphitheatre (les Arenas) is being restored and still in use today. Amazing feeling as we walked right around the whole thing. Got in early before there were too many visitors.",
          "Just now looking at TA reviews I realize that they had an audio guide. The person selling us the tickets did not mention that, so we just wondered around the place for a bit on our own. It's a big Roman arena, what else to say. Hardly any tablets around the place, so can't learn",
          "It was better preserved than the one in Rome . An absolutely Y amazing structure. We could only look inside as it is closed from time to time",
          "The high spot of any visit to Arles! However, we paid \u20ac9 each to get in only to find the entire place covered with metal seating and scaffolding prior to an impending bull-fight. Bitterly disappointed! A complaint met with a Gallic shrug!",
          "An excellent stop as you explore the old town area of Arles, from the time the Roman Empire held sway over most of the Mediterranean. Also don't miss the Theatre Antique, so many historic sites in this area.",
          "If you love history and architecture, then you will be interested. This is not a place to walk, but some parts look fascinating. Probably, when events take place here, it becomes more interesting.",
          "A splendid example of Roman building. Amazing stonework -- look at the arches, the columns, the passageways and marvel at how it was planned and constructed. Then delve into the history: How the Romans used it, how it was turned into a walled city in the middle ages, and how",
          "Excellently preserved Roman amphitheater worth the visit. Easy to image the gladiators fighting here.",
          "It is very good to see a structure that still stands after 2000 years. However, the more impressive is the layout of this Amphitheatre, unchanged - most of the stadium today has the same layout.",
          "Even that the place is under reconstruction, it looms very original and im a very good condition. Excelent place to visit",
          "Amphitheatre worth the visit , but could do with a little more information regarding its history and the restoration. However it is used a a venue for numerous activitys so well done",
          "its a nice place you should visit also you can enjoy a break around the area . its a very big and old theatre",
          "From Roman times, still active. Performances of music or bull fightings. Beautifully kept. Next to it is another Roman forum.",
          "I'm not sure why but given the hype from the locals about it being virtually intact I was expecting a bit more. Very little background info in English and not that much to it.",
          "The amphitheater has been cleaned and restored. It sits right in town surrounded by cafes and ancient buildings still used today. The town was advertising bullfights there in October.",
          "This amphitheatre is located in a high part of town and was built in Roman times. it looks impressive from the outside. We were surprised to learn that Bullfights still take place here.",
          "This Roman arena must have been impressive in its day. Still mostly intact and accessible. There is Camargue Bull fighting here throughout the year and it can hold a fair few people. The view from the tower above the entrance is good. You get a fine view of the surrounding area",
          "Tremendous history and quite easy to imagine how it was in Roman times. It is still used for modern events plus Bull fights & Bull games. These games use frisky small bulls from the Camargue. The locals get the Bulls going to the degree that they even jump right over the",
          "well worth seeing though it is a bullring inside and has modern simple seating however that probably gives more of an idea of what it actually looked like when in use",
          "This is the first Amphitheatre I have visited and I was blown away with it. You get a real sense of what it must have been like when it was first used. They run regular events which look well worth a visit.",
          "The Amphitheatre of Arles is one of the Roman buildings available for visits and still nowadays used for performances, including bullfight. The monument is interesting for itself, as a testimony of the importance of Arles in the Roman Empire of the time. It also represents a",
          "Wish I hadn't bothered - for 9 EUR they force you to buy a ticket for the Theatre as well, and neither are really that interesting. Have a look through the fence and spend your money on a crepe instead.",
          "Visited using the Arles pass that covers a few historical sites. We also had the electronic guide that we full of interesting information. All in all we were given a fresh, non Hollywood version, of Roman history. It is considered the best preserved arena and is still in use",
          "Spent several hours here roaming and taking in the history. Wanted to stay for the spectacle bhutvnobtimr. Watched the set up and it looked aweso me.",
          "If they are on, it is well worth a visit. No bull gets killed but there are lots of close calls as the young taggers try to snatch a ribbon from the bull's horns then run for their lives. It's a fun way to experience a wonderful venue.",
          "The Colosseum seated 20,000 and is in fine display. It is still in use for various events.It is a must do if you are in Arles.",
          "We joined the English guided tour. The guide was informative and patient. Remember to get the package ticket which covers the major sites.",
          "The whole town seems to show up in costume for this - do make sure to have a can of water mist as it gets VERY hot, no shade. A parasol even better. Free display each month - well worth doing once. The horses are amazing, children perform too, lovely tradition.",
          "There are several of these to visit, Arles, Orange and the Arena of Nimes. It is situated in the middle of the town. special occasions it is still in use.",
          "Traditional contest, where the young men try to snatch ribbons off the bulls horns-great fun-and no blood!",
          "This is a well maintained Amphitheater and worth the stop, especially if you are staying locally... surrounded by the old town of Arles and numerous places to eat, stop and take a look at history.",
          "The amphitheatre was beautiful and unexpected. It's a beautiful city and very walkable. Arles was definitely a find.",
          "I visited this afternoon and the highlight were the views from the tower above the entrance which are lovely. The top level is worth walking around, but the inside is hugely compromised by the stadium seating all around the top level, which allows it to be used for shows, but",
          "Enjoyed it with the pass .. lucky to accidentally hit the gladiator show .. otherwise might have been a snoozer.",
          "This amphitheatre rivals anything I've seen in Rome. It is very impressive. Don't neglect seeing it at night as it is illuminated with lights. Once inside we were treated to a demonstration by modern-day gladiators. Very interesting.",
          "This amphitheatre is very well preserved and well worth a visit even if only from the outside. Lots of souvenir shops around it.",
          "As most reviews already state, just visit the amphitheatre from the outside. Under renovation which shows you the difference between the old and the renovated part, nice to see.",
          "A visit to Arles is incomplete without a trip to the amphitheatre. Still in use today with modern seats installed. Under that there is the original building. Walking under the arches and climbing the towers ate three hours and not one minute begrudged. If you have any interest",
          "Went to see the Camarguaises version of bullfighting. Almost harmless for the bulls and dangerous for the humans. Especially if they are young silly and tipsy. Not us. Amazing to sit in a 2000 year old structure watching a wonderful show. Highly recommend it to get a real",
          "What awesome history. Must see. Kids are free. Only 9 euros. Feels so awesome inside. Great views of Arles. Parking is insane though.",
          "The amphitheatre is old and the seating reflects that. We were lucky to see bull race there and it was very interesting only they commentated only in French so we English speaking tourists found it difficult to follow.snacks were served while the race was on for those who wanted",
          "A must when in Arles is the \"Running of the Bulls\", it has turned into a local sport and a real spectacle. you sit in this wonderful Roman Arena to watch young guys pit there speed and skill against a raging bull that would make any man think twice about stepping into this bull",
          "It was avery hot day when I visited, however, it was certainly worth the effort. It really was an impressive sight and still in use! 9 Euro to visit, worth every euro cent !",
          "Got a pass to see the amphitheater, the th\u00e9\u00e2tre antiques, the Roman bath and the mus\u00e9e Reattu. Excellent value for money, got a great guide for the tour of the amphitheater and all together, found that the little town of Arles is well worth a day visit. Will most definitely be",
          "If this is on when you are in town, do not miss it! 11 euro and a great adventure! The excitement I suppose you feel at bullfighting, but no one is hurt. The razateurs try to cut a ribbon from between the bull's horns. It is very exciting! Cool arena too!",
          "Based on the Colosseum the structure is impressive and still in use. We had not realised there would be a show but many afternoons seem to feature some activity. The 13euro each for a ticket was well worth it both to explore the structure and to see the spectacle of young men",
          "Not in very good shape but it is there in the heart of the old town and very easily accessible from the hotel",
          "Just impressive. A place to visit. Nothing to spend hours unless you viait a show there. But a must see.",
          "This amphitheatre is much bigger than I thought it would be ,and still in use for modern day shows worth a visit and easy to find.",
          "Built in 80 AD to hold 20,000 fans and still in use! Had 60 entrances and folks would buy their tickets the day before. Seating was based on social hierarchy with slaves on top and women below them (except Vestals who sat up front). In the morning were the wild animals,",
          "This place is really worth a visit or maybe two as it's worth seeing the arena on its own as well as one of the sporting events that take place there, such as \"course camarguaise\", where young guys try to snatch \"cocardes\" from the bulls and then exit unharmed. The bulls live to",
          "The Roman Amphitheater is very well preserved and is even used for the bull. From the tower there is a very good view of the whole city.",
          "You sit in a place peopme sat thousands years ago and where so many things happened! Very nice experience, we went for a bull play and it was nice, nice show and they respected the animals as they dont kill them, its very impressive as some of the beast are huge so thumb up to",
          "Amphitheaters/coliseums dot Europe. Most are in ruins. In Arles, you find one that is amongst the most complete in existence (Nimes is in competition). It amazes me that it remains in tact, especially give the medieval penchant for pilfering every Roman cut stone that could",
          "We visited with a group on a guided walk. This roman amphitheater is the most complete example I have visited. Les Arenes means The Sands named due to the forum being laid with sand. It is still in use for a more humane type of bull sport and is used for other types of",
          "There were gladiator demonstrations on when I was there. I think they are on Tuesday and Thursday during the summer. It is well worth trying to catch them. Also there is a little gladiator school for children. The are on three times a day. I nearly missed it. I caught the tail",
          "Although there are lots of information notices around the arena, we would recommend that you take the free guided tour which is really interesting.",
          "We went to the Bull Racing here as well as a general visit and it was very interesting. You can wonder round on your own and there are information boards dotted about. As for the bull racing this only takes place in July and August and then on Mon, Wed and Fri. The bulls don't",
          "When travelling one is always astounded at what has survived the centuries and how sites such as this brings alive events of the past.",
          "very beautiful and very interesting... historical monument. definitely worth a visit or at least a walk",
          "This is a stunning piece of Roman architecture and it's amazing that it still stands today. It has an interesting history of usage but on the day we visited the whole inside of the arena was covered in seating for bull fights which were going on around the 14th July. It didn't",
          "If you wish to get away from people in Arles stick to the Roman sites. They are big enough to absorb people and you never feel overwhelmed. This one is an excellent example of its type and whilst of course rebuilt and remade for the 20th/21st Century nevertheless allows us to",
          "We were lucky enough to be there for a bull game. It was a great time the wife even enjoyed it. Just to be inside as a true spectator was an impressive feeling. You can feel the history & explore the place not as a tourist to the amphitheater but of the bull game all most as a",
          "Amphitheatre in Arles is just amazing. Just like others magnificent buildings that Romans built. Arles as a city it's like history (Ancient Rome) jewel of France. It's not that big as others, but it's still worth of visit. We were there in July and as I we got in, there were",
          "That the Romans were building something like this while we were living in mud huts speaks volumes. It is so dramatic and great it is STILL used as a venue....",
          "Pretty incredible to see - especially as it is still in use. It is very close to most everything else in Arles, defiantly worth a visit.",
          "I'm amazed that such structures still remain standing after all these years. This is another must see in Arles",
          "This well preserved Roman arena is well worth a visit. We were even fortunate to see two gladiators performing a pretty good fight for a party of school children as a docent explained to them the history and how the fight was being conducted. No blood on the sand fortunately!",
          "This is one of the centre pieces of Arles. A Roman amphitheatre whose size impresses. It was pleasant to walk around with a good opportunity to see all the above ground, front and back of house. Sadly much of the top set of seats have been removed in the idle ages for the",
          "Some days in the week they present a bullfight. Entrance costed 9 EUR and it's a good way to visit the Arena from the inside. During the bullfight, the bulls are not injured or killed, the matador needs only to take some rings from the horns",
          "We enjoyed the self guided tour of the arena and the history. True it is still being used so modern scaffolding was visible in some areas but the views were still impressive and the architecture was stunning inside and out. Our vote for the full impact is to see interior as well",
          "The structure and the exterior are superb and very well maintained, highlighting the engineering prowess of the Romans. Unfortunately, as the arena housed the town within for centuries before being in regular use for the last 100+ years for contemporary events and bull fights",
          "It was a delight to see this Arena and learn the history. It is still being used today. The climb into the arena is a bit steep, so not for persons with walking isssues.",
          "The arena is restored well but ruined with all the sits for the bull corrida or manifestation like that. Nothing special",
          "One of the must see sights...although it would have been helpful to have an audio or some kind of small video/tour explaining. We were in and out in about 20 mins - but was the thing to view while in Arles. We have been to Rome so we have seen the larger more elaborate",
          "You can get a pass to see most of the attractions in Arles from the tourist office or at the attraction itself. You can access most of the amphitheatre and there is a handy guide which is available in many languages. There are a lot of steps but the view from the top over",
          "Amazing amphitheater , so old , great view from top of it. Reminded us of colosseum , it was a shame to see all the modern scaffolding and seating in there as took away from the ruins . They still use it today though which is quite incredible",
          "It is pretty much intact and very impressive to see the size and imagine the busy life here more the 2 thousand years ago.",
          "Fantastic arena from Roman times. Very large and well preserved. Really worthwhile seeing this structure to marvel at its size and what it used to be like.",
          "This is a fantastic Roman amphitheater that is still in use for special bullfights that are not the usual Spanish ones. Here the bull is not harmed and is the star of the show.The \"matadores\" try to pick off some tassels that are on the bull. The amphitheater went through many",
          "From Roman theatre to fortress, to an easy quarry for constructing other buildings in Arles, to a city within a city with lots of houses and streets within the arena. Until the decision was made to restore as much as possible. A fascinating structure. Nice to walk around the",
          "You get a sense of history as you walk around les Arenes. Climb the tower as the views over Arles as well as the amphitheatre are worth it.",
          "the amphitheatre is a good example but there are lots of scaffolding , however its easy to get the atmosphere of what it must have been like. no admission discount for senior citizens",
          "Arles dates back to Roman times and has a huge amphitheatre dating from 75AD. It held 20,000 spectators. In the fourth century Arles was invaded by barbarians and the population retreated to the amphitheatre where they removed the seating and built 200 houses and two chapels! A",
          "The Arenes amphitheatre is a magnificanr restoration the gives the fell of Roman strength and power in the peak of their domination of France. The sheer engineering ability in an age before modern plant is a sight to behold",
          "The Arles Amphitheater is not only amazing for it's Roman history, but also because of it's post Roman history. It basically became a walled village itself, inhabiting thousands of residents inside it's protective border. The historic drawings of how this site evolved are",
          "A most amazing , huge Roman amphitheatre right in the centre of Arles, surrounded at close quarters by houses and restaurants. As you walk around the exterior of the amphitheatre, you realise what architectural geniuses the Romans were. As we only had a short time in Arles, we",
          "We visited the arena on our first day and upon walking up it was breathtaking when you think about how long ago it was built.",
          "The Amphitheatre in Arles, France is an incredible piece of lasting history. Explore and understand the reach of the ancient Romans and their architecture. It's worth the visit.",
          "Great visit stop I'm the museum pass. Hard to believe this ancient place is still used for bullfights and other events.",
          "I found this Colosseum totally different and very impressive that many other ones I have seen before.",
          "Stunning Roman relic still in use for events well worth a visit. It is amazing to imagine that it is still in use after almost two thousand years.",
          "When you first come upon this site your first thought is of Rome's Colosseum because of it design. Of course it is much smaller. Interesting aspect is that it is still used today for bull contests and other events. Hard to miss from anywhere in town an should be a must see.",
          "The arena is very impressive - well maintained for its age. The history is fascinating, especially the fact that there were houses inside during the Middle Ages. Impressive that it is still being used today.",
          "The amphitheatre is a great Roman remain, a must visit. Even though the upper levels of the original Roman building have gone what you can go round is an authentic Roman arena, one that is still used.",
          "An amazing relic, well worth a visit. Good access (most not suited to wheelchairs, though) to most areas, without the crowds. On the day I went, there was very few people. Use your imagination to hear cheering crowds over thrilling gladiator battles. 2000 years of history. Mind",
          "This is a must see. The Roman amphitheater is in pristine shape and quite beautiful juxtaposed to the French shops and cafes.",
          "If you want to go inside obtain at least the 'Liberty' city pass which allows you 4 entrances plus 2 museums from the TI in town. We spent a little more-15\u20ac and got a pass good for everything (except Foundation Van Gogh which is not covered in any city pass). As for the",
          "My hotel faced this large coliseum from one BC. It was interesting to see for awhile then it just became a nuisance to walk around.",
          "After passing the ticket kiosk, find the English display under the second arch describing the arena's history and renovation. The arena is a fine example of Roman engineering. The entrance fee is covered by the Liberty Pass. Open year round",
          "A good site in the centre of Arles. Easy to view from several levels and to get good views of the town from the tower. Long opening hours helps to avoid the crowds",
          "I can't even begin to tell y'all how awful this sight was. It was boring as hell and I lowkey wanted to kill myself. It sucked booty. DONT EVER GO. The French people bullied me and my family and it was a horrible experience.",
          "This is not the only amphitheatre in the region, but it is one of the best kept. Really magnificent, it characterizes the city of Arles more than any other of its sights.",
          "Had a guided tour,in English,but they do other languages as well.A interesting guide who was local to Arles and we had a great chat about the Bulls! Worth a visit but better with the guide.There's been a lot of restoration but hey,Its OLD!",
          "The amphitheatre is now used for bull fights and concerts, so the roman layout is now swapped in a seating structure compliant with modern rules, so the original historical structure is difficult to appreciate.",
          "Worth a visit to view the outside but once inside what a disappointment it was to me. Full of metal seating stands to support bull fight viewing. The whole grandure of the theatre and Roman skill was lost in a mess of steel.",
          "It is hard to describe the les Arenes in Arles. This huge structure towers over the city and is literally the tourist mecca of this town. Still in use today for events as varied as bullfighting, plays and concerts and dating back to about 90 CE, a truly amazing architectural",
          "Just like the colosseum but on a smaller scale, worth going into a you can get close to all the action, would have loved to see the bullfighting",
          "This venue bought tears to the eyes. It's full of time and history and the enormity of it is unfathomable. An amazing location for the photography enthusiast with a lot of alley ways, deep shadows and never ending corners. My one downside was that it seems to hold bull",
          "In the heart of the city this is not to be missed. You can walk all around on different levels & its easy to get caught up in the atmosphere. Morning seem to be less crowded so recommend that",
          "If you go to Arles you must feel lucky! It is one of the most beautiful little towns I have ever seen, and so out of this world that you will think you are in a movie! The town itself is a monument, but if you like ancient monuments this amphitheatre is what you have to see. You",

          "This is my first visit to a Roman amphitheater and I was blown away! Walking up in the tower, getting views over the city, walking through the passageways gives you a taste of what it was like so long ago. Posters up all around tell of the opening of the season for",
          "Unexpectedly, this ruin delivered. Just a little smaller than Nimes and not as well preserved (or restored?). Not as Overtly Impressive as Orange's Theatre. Yet this site, tucked into the sweet little town of Arles, bought the Romans back to life for us. Maybe it's the stroll",
          "Built by the Romans, and modeled after it's counterpart in Rome, this colliseum is a marvel. Just the fact that it still stands is a tribute to the engineering ability of the Romans. It is still in use for concerts and annual ceremonies. Stadiums today should last as long!",
          "this is a restored amphitheater - with lots of 'downed' pedestals etc. they do have concerts here in the summer",
          "The arena attracts, but remains unreachable. At several other sites, one can go down to the arena of the amphitheatre. In Arles, I did not find it possible (oh yeah, I may have been ungainly, myself. Or it may really be restricted). Yet, having been to Rome's Coliseo and several",
          "In the heart of the town, the area still inspires a feeling of awe. It has survived the millennia, despite being used as a quarry and a fortified town, now being preserved as a wonderful arena. I wish I could witness the F\u00e9ria to be held here over Easter as I'm sure it will be",
          "Amazing! Well worth a visit and a wander. Such a sense of history around you. The walk up the tower is well worth the walk. Affords great views",

          "Interesting amphitheatre. Worth seeing even if you have seen the Colosseum in Rome (which we saw a year ago). Suffers a bit by comparison to Nimes amphiteatre, which is well-preserved and has excellent audioguide. This one in Arles actually seems bigger. Climb to top for",
          "Very interesting to see a 2000 year old building still in use for public spectacles today. The programme of restoration works is impressive and the info boards have a s mattering of English as Wells's French. Just around the corner from the theatre.",
          "I prefer this as an example of a roman amphitheatre to visit than the Colosseum in Rome. There's nobody hassling you, it's easy to walk around, not full of cats and just as spectacular in it's architecture.",
          "We stayed in Arles on our way to the south coast on a motorcycle tour. Visited here in the evening, about an hour before closing so was good and quiet. Took about 45 minutes to walk around and look at everything and was well worth the 18 Euros for the two of us (without the",
          "This amazing old place in the centre of Arles is still in use today. Far more impressive than I thought it would",
          "It's a very interesting visit nonetheless, specially if you've never seen a roman arena before. But the structures mounted to allow the place to be used for shows and other events take away all the ambiance, as you can see in the pictures. It's worth a visit anyway, but it could",
          "I took a tour in French although my french is less than good and enjoyed it very much. I would suggest to read some history before you visit.",

          "You will not miss the best preserved Roman amphitheater in Europe. Of course you will compare the Coliseum, but ... arena is \"whole\", offers a sharper image and on a combat theater of antiquity. Hats off for the way in which it was preserved!",
          "Amazing amphitheater that has been redone and is used for events currently.climb to the top for some great views of the city.",
          "Simply put this is one of the finest ancient ampitheatre's in the world. In the heart of the lovely Provence town of Arles, it really is a must see!. Take care with the steps though if you are less mobile there are many if you want to see the best views.",
          "We saw a show at Christmas and it was fabulous. The security was very good and it was a brilliant experience. I highly recommend going at Christmas.",
          "At the centre of Arles a great piece of city history and well preserved. A very nice area to visit and go around",
          "While not as big as the amphitheater in Rome, more of this structure has been better preserved/reconstructed. These structures look better when they have not been completely destroyed by subsequent people using them for rock quarries. You get a really good sense of the size of",
          "Advertised as one of the best preserved arenas from the ancient Roman world, in fact, this arena is well preserved, mainly due to the fact it has been in use for almost 2000 years. Smaller than the Roman coliseum, but basically the same concept, it is a great example of Roman",

          "Loved outside (the place closed minutes before we arrived there). Definitely a place to visit next time (with doors open).",
          "This is probably the best preserved Roman coliseum I have seen. Still in very good condition and much has been restored. Gives a great idea of what it was like to watch the fights, races, etc in the Roman era. The tour guide provided very good description and in particular the",
          "Stunning by night just to wander around and so much quieter than the daytime. Lots of restaurants to sit at and admire the view.",
          "While not as big as the Colosseum in Rome, it is completely there and still used, these days for bull fights. The english audio tour is worth the small cost.",
          "The amphitheater is right in the middle of the old town. We were lucky to get a parking space across the street. The amphitheater is still in use and it's fun to see the seat numbers on the stone seats. You can get around pretty quickly. I liked this mini coliseum. You",
          "This is a definitely must see. The amphitheater is smaller than the coliseum in Rome, but it's just as impressive. Apparently, it is still being used. A friend mentioned that she was able to see a concert in it. This would have been a wonderful experience and I wish we would",
          "The full-size arena gives one a strong impression of how the original facility must have looked. The various seating areas are easily accessible. Most interesting are the vaults and galleries behind the seating areas. The significant amount of reconstruction detracts somewhat",

          "Having been to Rome, I was unsure about this one. However in many ways, I liked it better. The scale is such that it was comprehensible in its scale, function and construction. Plus, they're still using it for bull fights, which significantly helps its energy. Make sure you",
          "Impressive amphitheater. Definitely worth a visit when in Arles. It's very close to the Colosseum, also worth a trip.",
          "We loved walking round the arena. Who would have thought this 'very' complete arena still existed in this beautiful french town! It was like a slightly smaller version of Rome but without the mass of tourists! Great to hear it is still in use as well!",
          "This Ampitheatre is one of the top 20 of the ancient roman ampitheatres. It once held close to 20,000 people. There are great views of the city and the Rhone from the top levels.",
          "Loved visiting the arena. We did not use the audio tour we just strolled through the arena. Beautiful view of Arles from the top of the arena.",
          "Quite an amazing to have a Roman amphitheatre in the centre of a bustling city that is now in use as the local bull ring! It is huge and in very good condition considering the age, but I imagine its continued use as a bull ring has something to do with that. Well worth a visit.",
          "It was nice to go inside and see it. We had a local guide with us and learned that it was actually saved because local people started moving in and building \"homes' in the amphitheater many, many years ago. Many years passed, and the powers that be realized what a jewel they",

          "Deciding between Average and Above Average was difficult. The amphitheater has been amazingly well preserved. You can walk around the exterior and understand the size of the structure. Built in the 1st century B.C. to accommodate about 10,000 spectators the amphitheater",

          "Interesting and well presented. You need to be reasonably agile however as steps are high and there are lots of them. Within a few minutes of Hotel du cloitre and hotel Amphiteatre. You can get a joint ticket for up to 4 antiquities and this one is a stonesthrow from the Ancient",

          "The shell of the outer walls remain standing in the large amphitheatre in Arles. Quite impressive. For a small entrance fee you can go inside which is recommended. There is a good view from the top of the stands over the town to the Rhone river. In the theatre there is lots of",

          "Les Arenes (Roman Amphitheatre) in the southern French town of Arles is an excellent and smaller version of what you might see in Rome - only this one is in Provence. Built in 90 A.D., it could hold up to 20,000 spectators for the many gladiator games and chariot races popular",
          "What an exceptional place to visit and such a surprise, right in the middle of town. Even though we knew of the existence and some of the history of this site, to see it first hand is so different. It is in great condition and the audio tour is really informative without being",
          "This is really a must see if your in Arles.The amphtheatre is still in use today.It is very well maintained and still holds events.When we were there it held a bullfight(which it does twice a year.) The festival that weekend was a rice festival with many of the local restaurants",
          "Really enjoyed this smaller version of Rome's Colosseum. Fewer crowds, accessible views. The from the tower is breathtaking (if you can make the steps).",
          "My wife and I visited the Roman Amphitheatre on a hot Provencal day. 39 degrees. the arena is massive but acts like a mirror for the sun, making moving around inside even more uncumfortable. The parts of the amphitheatre are linked with cool (mercifully) unlit tunnels, so it was",
          "I visited with a combined ticket for only \u20ac9, it's available online or at the tourism office of Arles. It's pretty well preserved. But at the same time you can see some protection they put for the architecture also some extra seats (because they still use it for some event",
          "The Arena is an impressive structure with very clever and complementary modern renovations. It is imposing as you near it, imposing as you as you enter and look up and just intriguing as you sit in one of the seats to contemplate the spectacles that have taken place there over",
          "Tourists, including men in tank tops, so forth, took our astonished eyes away some of the stunning features of this Roman built Goliath. When we lasted visited Arles in 1961, Arles had still to be discovered, so fortunately there were no security guards to keep us from crawling",
          "Well worth the visit. Easily accessible from Central Arles. Amazing to see this ancient ruin. You can visit both Arenas. The original one has a small entry fee to roam around.",
          "Major roman amphitheater, historical monument . Walk around the outside for free, or pay to go inside.",
          "We did not take the time to go inside although maybe we should've. It's marvelous from the outside. By here are many signs in English that explain the history as well as the current restoration.",
          "Enjoy a moonlight walk through time to avoid the daytime crowds. Follow this up with the Van Gogh Walk as the 1st \"easel\" is located here",
          "If you have seen one you have seen them all and this has nothing special t offer. Unfortunately when we were there the seats from the bull fights were still installed so takes away the enjoyment. Not sure When /if they are taken down",
          "This amazing structure built right in the middle of town and very well preserved is huge. The rest of the town has been built around it and it still dwarfs everything else. It is in a rather scruffy area of town that I would not like to visit at night but even so it is well",
          "The grand amphitheatre is Arles' historical pride and attraction, a very well-maintained structure that serves as a venue for concerts, operas and other cultural events even in this day and age. Truly stunning.",
          "...this superbly preserved Roman amphitheatre in the middle of Arles. Wonderfully preserved. You may find, as I did, the metal staircases and supports obtrusive, but overall it's not to be struck by this 2000 year old building. Don't miss it!",
          "Plan your trip to Arles to take in the Friday night bull racing. It has a great atmosphere set in the old Colosseum and was great fun. Hard to describe ( not bullfighting - the bull does not get hurt) but very enjoyable.",
          "Lovely place to visit. Very relaxing and beautiful views, although not very much information for tourists. Make sure to pick up a Liberte pass from the tourist office. Will save you a lot of money!",

          "We visited this attraction as part of a multi ticket offer. The arena is now used for shows involving bulls (but not fights). It has wonderful views from the top of the tower and guided tours are available. The structure is in good condition and has plenty of interesting",
          "We hadn't planned on seeing the Courses Camarguaises while visiting Arles, but were so glad we had the opportunity to do so. It was a history lesson about the horses and bulls grown in this area and the traditions surrounding them. The bull fight was very interesting. We had",
          "we could really witness the Roman influence in this city. A trip not to miss in family or couple but in cool weather",
          "Aside from the obvious historical interest of this amazingly well-preserved Roman coliseum, it's definitely worth checking out for the bloodless bull games played here. Lots of excitement in the air as the young men try to pull ribbons off the horns of occasionally angry and",
          "This was a great experience for the entire family. We started early in the day with a tour of the arena. They offer English speaking guides but we decided to go it alone. We soaked in a lot of history and got some great photos of the surrounding town and countryside. Later",
          "Yes but it's virtually complete a right bang in the centre of town. They do hold gladiator and bull fighting exhibitions but I found that these are aimed at tourists, predominantly French at that. That said its well worth a visit as the building is very complete and being",
          "A classic Roman arena, mostly intact, remarkable architecture. Not as large or complete as the one in nearly Nimes (which should not be missed). Highlight was the wonderful bull show on Wednesday nights. They run after the bull, trying to grab a marker from between his horns.",
          "Returned especially for the bi-weekly bull fight and horse show. Well advertised around the arena and town. Arrived to be told in typical 'couldn't care less attitude' it was cancelled. It felt like it was regularly cancelled...",
          "The Arles Amphitheatre is a stunning reminder of the power of ancient Rome. While it is much smaller than its slightly older counterpart in Rome, the Colosseum, it is somewhat better preserved (or rather reconstructed) and is still in use today. We visited the Arena (as it's",

          "A real highlight of our visit to the fascinating town of Arles! Would recommend to anyone, it must be seen if you are there!",
          "We visited the arena as part of out boat trip and it's about a 10 minute walk from the jetty. Fantastic area but very hot! Still used today",
          "great place - very few people there whilst we were there, which enabled us to absorb the atmosphere and be taken back 2,000 years. Great that it's still being used for entertainment.",
          "What's cool about this amphitheater is that it is still in use today, 2000 years after its construction. Every week there is a performance from courses camarguaises (where they don't kill the bulls) to shows of Arlesian traditions to real bullfights (where the bull is killed).",
          "We visited Arles on our Viking cruise. The first day we went to Arles and began a walking tour of the city. We walked up to the Roman amphatheatre which has been restored and is still in use. It is very impressive. It is still used for concerts and bull fights.",
          "I was in Arles in December 2012 (part of a 6 country Eurorail jaunt). Friends had told me this town is a horrible tourist town in the summer, but December was wonderful there; although 2C, it was clear blue skies the whole time. And you can buy a combination ticket for the",
          "The fact this huge amphitheatre survives from Roman times is amazing, but it's hard to imagine what it must have been like as the whole thing is covered in scaffolding and wooden seating. Probably a great place to watch something (they do gladiator fights!) but as a tourist",
          "A beautiful specimen, the center of life in today's Arles. This is the core. We rented a house across the street. What a view! Everything in antique Arles emanates from here.",
          "This amphitheater dates to Roman times. It is well preserved and maintained and used as an events'- bull fighting ring PLUS concert venue. From the top of the stadium there are some beautiful views of the Rhone River. Based on the design, it is probably an excellent concert",
          "For 12 euros, you can see 4 monuments (all within a short walk from each other) and 1 museum. All impressive ruins. In-between, try one or two cafes.",
          "Actively used today, but built by Romans about the same time as the famous Roman Coliseum. They still host bull fights - can't say I'm excited about that. But the history and architecture was fun to see. Try to avoid hot weather when seeing this.",
          "This a well preserved Roman amphitheater still in use for bullfights and other events. I bought a ticket to visit on my own and wandered around inside. Nearby is a Roman theater, also still used today.",
          "Overall this place was interesting - somewhat because it has the Roman history to it, but is still used for current events. You can learn some construction info, use your imagination about past events, and see one of the better preserved amphitheaters of Europe.",
          "This is a well preserved piece of Roman architecturen not as grand as the Coliseum in Rome, but similar the one in Verona, Italy. It stands as the centre piece of the Old Walled Town and is surrounded by sidewalk cafe's and souvenir shops. Another ancient building of interest,",
          "Arles has a few examples of Roman construction, all of which are easy to find and visit. This Amphitheatre is still used today. To my best of recollection, there were no private tours for it, however, there were many panels with pictures and information about the time and the",
          "This roman coliseum has been very well restored and is a fine example of Roman architecture. There are bull races on certain nights for those interested.",
          "We visited about 30 minutes before closing and got this a little cheaper which was a bonus. We made it for the last session of gladiator combat which really helped to bring the history of the place back to life. It would have been nice to see an opera or the bull running to",
          "les Arenes is a beautiful Romain monument very well preserved. I attended 2 parties of \"Les rencontres d'Arles\" the bigger and older festival of photography of the world. It was a great experience",
          "This was the third Roman amphitheater I have toured, including the Coliseum in Rome, and it was outstanding. The students learned a great deal and it is in great shape!",
          "What a wonderful experience this was, you could feel the history throughout the Amphitheatre as you walked round, make your way to the top seats for a outstanding view and photo's. This is great value at 9 euro's. We went back the following night for the Bull races, this is",
          "This was an extraordinary and unmissable experience. We were privileged to watch a modern display of extraordinary skill by the gardians (wranglers) of the white horses and black bulls of the Camargue, in an arena built by the Romans 2000 years ago for their own barbaric games.",
          "Forget Rome, here you will have a real alternative. This will be a real Roman experience: you will feel it closer, without the enormous tourist mass, and with a real quiet and laid down ambient. Just great.",
          "We attended a bull game in the Arles Amphitheater. it was an amazing experience to be able to attend an event in a 2000 year old building, walking through the tunnel-like corridors and coming out under a round arch into the bright sunshine to sit on a stone seat and watch the",
          "Fabulous experience. Tickets alsogive you entry to 2 other Roman sites in Nimes. This is the best-preserved of the 2 amphitheatres (the other is in Arles) in the region. You can climb high up and imagine the Roman gladiators etc in the arena. The 360o view from the top, of the",
          "As this coliseum is still working, it provides a more complete and cared for version than Rome in a way. Smaller of course and less well labelled/explained than its famous cousin... But great to climb around and explore",
          "One of the main reasons many people visit Arles other than Art and worth doing so. The Roman history of Arles is so interesting and this is so worth a visit. Can get quite busy so get there before the hordes!",
          "Amazingly preserved Roman arena. Went to see the bull games and back for night time photo op. A close walk from anywhere in Arles.",
          "The amphitheatre is a must see in Arles. Definitely the highlight of the trip and the site Arles is most famous for, it is well restored and huge. There is a tower to the side providing great views over the whole city. It is open roofed so a good idea to go on a sunny day!",
          "This is a beautiful area to explore. There are fabulous Roman ruins that are partially restored as well as piles of rubble excavated from the site. In total we spent less than an hour here.",
          "It is always amazing to experience a historical site such as this. The Amphitheatre is structurally beautiful and it was wonderful to be able to sit on the stone steps and walk on the walls and imagine what it was like so many years ago. I highly recommend visiting this site",
          "My family visited in July. Go early as it gets too hot in the middle of the day. The Nimes/ Orange combined ticket offers excellent value for money. The view in the theatre was a bit spoils because they were setting up for a concert by David Gilmore - so it was full of staging",
          "Must say after the visit of Arena of Nimes i had doubt to go in. But this actually was much better to see. It remind me to be in Barcelona. Really lovely to be there and great view when going to the tower. Is a good price so if you there don't miss it.",
          "This is a must see. To walk within the walls of so much history is breathtaking. Explore, take pictures and look out for the cat. We think he is a Lion come back to haunt the walls and keep visitors in line.",
          "The amphitheater is no doubt the main attraction in Arles. Given its age and the fact that it is still being used regularly it's in amazing condition. If you have any kind of interest in history it's a must see. Admission fee is pretty modest at 9 euro. If you're planning to see",
          "It was an amazing experience to sit on stone steps that Romans sat on 2000 years ago. And it was even more exciting to watch the bull games in the arena. I loved Arles and this was a very Arlesian thing to do.",
          "We came by to visit the building only. However, on the same day, they made some kind of bull fight - with no fighting :-) Arles in general is very lovely.",
          "We went to Arles,you can't fail to miss the amphitheatre. As per a previous post,we walked around it and peered inside. As mentioned previously,the walk around it was impressive enough without the need to go inside,you can see lots of scaffolding holding the new seats over the",

          "The amphitheatre is Arles is typical for the era. We've seen plenty and this one is very well preserved and still in use. That's why they have installed modern benches over the the Roman stone.",
          "Wandering thru town after dinner upon arrival, with plans to visit the arena the following day. Well, it seemed they were having a grand spectacle with free entry that night, so we stumbled in and grabbed a seat. Good deal, quite the local patrimoine going on. Unfortunately, Mr.",
          "This was the reason we went to Arles for the day. Although there was a modern stage inside when we visited it is well worth it if you're into history. Parking was fun, but once we found a spot it wasn't the extortionate rates we would expect in the UK. All in all, I'd",
          "Not quite as big or smart as its neighbour in Nimes but beautiful none these. Parked in the middle of the old town.",
          "The Arles Amphitheatre is a beautiful scene to see. We went there by train from Marseilles. It did not cost much and duration was not too long either, I just do not remember the times unfortunately. But it was a pleasant journey. The arena is only a few minutes walk from the",

          "The Arles Amphitheatre (Coliseum) is another beautiful legacy of the Roman ingenuity and engineering skills. Quite well preserved - despite the encroaching city buildings - it's still used for shows. Although more modest than its more famous sibling in Rome, it serves to show",
          "Arles has a history of being a Roman town in the 123 BC and there are numerous Roman buildings one of which is the Amphitheatre. Not to be missed, this place is a nice place to visit when in Arles.",
          "Enjoyed our look around this amphitheatre, probably preferred it to Nimes but not sure quite why! Annoyingly, like all the attractions like this in Provence, they have scaffolding and staging in the middle so ruins the atmosphere somewhat! Good views from the top and good amount",
          "Somewhat more authentic than N\u00eemes despite not being as well preserved. Nice views of the city from the higher seats. Informative audiotour.",
          "It was amazing to walk amongst a Roman built arena. It is over 1700 years old and a person could just imagine being there with chariot races happening. Highly recommend.",
          "Walking through the Ies Arenes, one will notice the difference between the original structures and the newly restored ones which stood side-by-side. The amphitheater represented the Roman occupation in this area and the historic life-style it left behind. Therefore visiting",
          "This is an excellently restored colosseum and captures remarkable features from its time of build 45BC !!!! ...... It was great from a historical perspective .... BUT WE GOT REALLY LUCKY ....whilst we were there we got to witness simulated gladiator battles (minus the thumb",

          "This Amphitheatre has a cousin in Nimes but this is smaller. It doesn't have cover from the sun but is very beautiful and a great place for learning",
          "Although labelled as an Amphitheatre this is an arena (the theatre is next door). I find that many of the reviews on Trip Advisor confuse the two. I always find these interesting but preferred the one in Nimes. Visit it by all means if you have bought the museums pass.",

          "I had great expectation of this Amphitheater but it was very disappointing. He admission charge was \u20ac8, and they didn't give you any literature or audio guide like others Roman sites in Provence. To my opinion that the Amphitheater in Nimes is far better. I would not even",
          "My husband and kids love Roman ruins and really enjoyed this monument. Things to climb on and easy to walk around. It would have been nice if there was more information in English, and more information all round actually. We went on Saturday when there is a big market on the",
          "The Arenes de Frejus is definitely worth a visit. The outside walls are from around 40 BC and give you a real sense of how the Frejusians lived during that period. You can imagine the bullfights, judgements for beheadings, parties and theatre that took place in each century. It",

          "The feeling of the age of the structure is spoiled by the modern seating. I guess they need to hold events inside to help pay for the restoration. On a positive note, our 8 euro admission also let us into the theatre.",
          "Amazing to think that the core of the arena is truly ancient. Brilliant views of Arles and the Rhine on the high tower. Make sure to walk the hallways under the stadium. There are some very interesting discoveries to be had."

        "wiki": "The University of Montpellier (French: Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier) is a French public research university in Montpellier in south-east of France. Established in 1292, the University of Montpellier is one of the oldest universities in the world.\nThe university was split into three universities (the University of Montpellier 1, the University of Montpellier 2 and the Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier 3) for 45 years from 1970 until 2015 when it was subsequently reunified by the merger of the two former, with the latter, now named Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier, remaining a separate entity.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe university is considerably older than its formal founding date, associated with a papal bill issued by Pope Nicholas IV in 1289, combining all the centuries-old schools into a university.It is not known exactly when the schools of liberal arts were founded that developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools that gathered around masters of rhetoric. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, from the school of law at Bologna, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The faculty of law has had a long career. Professors from Montpellier were prominent in the drafting of the Napoleonic Code, the civil code by which France is still guided and a foundation for modern law codes wherever Napoleonic influence extended. The faculty of law was reorganized in 1998.\nThe prestigious school of medicine was founded perhaps by people trained in the Spanish medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier University. It is the world's oldest medical school still in operation. The school of medicine owed its success to a policy of the Guilhem lords of Montpellier, by which any licensed physician might lecture there: with no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures multiplied, thus providing a great choice of teachers coming from all around the Mediterranean region (Guilhem VIII act of January 1181). The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III, which were confirmed and extended in 1240, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne, but the school enjoyed a great deal of de facto autonomy.\nThe school was famous for arguing in the fourteenth century that the Black Death was caused by a miasma entering the opening of the body's pores, citing theories developed by Galen. Doctors educated at Montpellier advocated against bathing because they claimed bathing opened the body's pores, making one more susceptible to the bubonic plague.In 1529, after some years as an apothecary, Nostradamus entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a \"manual trade\" expressly banned by the university statutes.[8] The expulsion document (BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87) still exists in the faculty library. Rabelais took his medical degree at Montpellier, and his portrait hangs among the gallery of professors.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, founded in 1593, is the oldest botanical garden in France. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine. The Benedictine monastery that had been converted into the bishop's palace, was given to house the medical school in 1795. A gallery devoted to the portraits of professors since 1239 contains one of Rabelais.\nThe school of theology had its origins in lectures in the convents: St. Anthony of Padua, Raymundus Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille all lectured. Two letters of King John II prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Pope Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law.\nIn the 16th century the local triumph of Calvinism interrupted the somewhat somnolent Catholic school of theology, which was reinstated in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. In better days, among Montpellier's illustrious pupils of law were Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers were William of Nogaret, chancellor to Philip IV, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards Pope Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, afterwards antipope Benedict XIII.\nLike all other provincial universities of France, that of Montpellier was suppressed at the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1793. The faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. The university of Montpellier was officially re-organised in 1969, on the aftermath of May 1968 and the students' revolt all over the country. It was split into its successor institutions the University of Montpellier 1 (comprising the former faculties of medicine, law, and economy), University of Montpellier 2 (science and technology) and University of Montpellier 3 (social sciences, humanities and liberal arts).\nOn 1 January 2015, the University of Montpellier 1 and the University of Montpellier 2 merged to form the newly recreated University of Montpellier. Meanwhile, the Paul Val\u00e9ry University Montpellier 3, now only Paul Val\u00e9ry, remains a separate institution.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nOverall Ranking\nUniversity of Montpellier secured 55th and 16th places in the world and Europe, respectively, in Reuters - The World's Most Innovative Universities 2018.

          "Very nicely renovated palace. Do take your time to take the tablet which is provided since it greatly enhances the visiting experience. Really worthwile!",
          "One of the most unique tours you'll see.Great architecture and heavy historical places!Fantastic use of technology.",
          "It is ridiculously massive. Audio guides could focus a bit more on history but I guess the 3D images taking you back in time are special. It was easy not getting lost also.",
          "One of the most unique tours you'll see. They have AR enables tablets that take you through a tour while you walk around the palace. This palace was also the centre of Christianity for some period of time. This place has some massive halls \u2026",
          "An imposing structure that reminds one more of a fortress than a church. It contains the history of a time when the Pope no longer resided in Italy that is certainly interesting to hear. The rooms themselves are mostly bare and don\u2019t \u2026",
          "Impressive building from the outside but lifeless and dull on the inside. Audio visual guide is well done and is definitely needed to bring some life to the inside.",

          "Amazing tour guide.. All automated like treasure hunt",
          "Palais des Papers is one of my favorite places in Avagnon. It was so fascinating with the projection of the rooms and it's storying telling was amazing . Best thing was the guide was free . It even include the treasure hunt game which I \u2026",
          "The interactive visit is really worth it",
          "Super good. The starters, main courses were excellent. Loved the truffle rissotte. Best make a reservation,  busy. The home made desserts we had were the best we had during our trip. The staff we very helpful, and would speak english as needed. Good value for the quality. Looking forward to our next visit.",
          "Nice old hotel, has small elevator up. Really great location. Very small breakfast with cold eggs not great, very small for $15 Euros, or maybe that was just our price, locals get lower price? You're a target if you're an American here in \u2026",
          "12\u20ac entrance for adults and 10\u20ac for kids, pupils/students.That's 54\u20ac for a family. Way too much for a cultural/historical place, a place for education. For example in Amsterdam kids or students etc. can visit museums or the royal palace for free!",
          "Very reasonably priced and extremely interesting. The audio visual guide (included in entry price) is exceptional and breathes life into the experience. Allow plenty of time for your visit as there is lots to see.",
          "Audio tours in many different languages make it easy to learn about such an interesting time in the church. The amount of time spent to walk the whole tour is well worth the 11 euros!",

          "Very interesting,  easy to move around the building, very Informative great way to spe d an afternoon",
          "Interesting way of experiencing an empty yet historically relevant building. In my view it is not a must see unless you do not know how to spend your time in Avignon. We enjoyed more the visit to other cities and areas.",
          "Worth a visit to this historic place.",
          "The building itself ist very beautiful and wirth it to visit. But the audioguide is really bad. It is to technically and everybody is just looking through the tablet. It should show you the rooms in the past, but just looks like a comic. You also can play a game with it to find a treasure.",
          "Worth a visit for the wall paintings in the Stag room",
          "Interesting as a building but there are only limited internal displays. I'd make do with the facade and save the entrance fee for a few coffees.",
          "Terrible experience. The palace is interesting to visit which stops me from giving 1 star. But the experience I had with their staff was so unpleasant it ruined the entire visit. And it was over the bathroom. A simple but important service \u2026",

          "We bought the combo Saint B. bridge/Palais ticket, saw the bridge first, then had lunch, then on to the Palais. The Histotab (included) was very helpful in seeing and hearing the story of the Palais in the 1300's.",

          "I would have loved to have visited and scored it higher but sadly the queues were far to long and to slow, especially as you are queuing in the heat. The area around is beautiful and the mini tour train worth doing.\n\nIf you want to get into \u2026",

          "Beautiful place, worth staying after dark",
          "The museum was great. I am surprised on how much they managed to do whit the little they were left with for the restauration. The guide is amazingly well done. Good job, fellow programmers! And the information audio guide tells you just enough to experience the way of life in the palace at the time.",
          "I was very interested as the pope had stayed in this castle. It s nice but watching n hearing via head phones n ioads was a munroe cumbersome added to scanning the coins in each room to hear the audio. Also our required half s day solely for the castle",

          "Must visit... And you must take the VR tablet, it changes everything, really... Deep dive back 700 years ago... Wow",

          "Lots of historical interest... also lots of steps.",
          "The tour with audioguide in tablets is very modern, interactive and provides a lot of information while also being fun. Augmented reality helps a lot with visualisation of previous state of the palace, which is now otherwise empty. Really liked it!",
          "One of the best guided tours I have every used, using tablets and augmented reality. An incredible monument to the medieval excesses of the Catholic Church, showing a need for Reformation. One negative is the over-zealous yet ill-equipped \u2026",

          "Definitely worth a visit.",

          "One of the most amazing medieval buildings in the world.  The scale is overwhelming and the fraction that is able to be open publicly is well worth a visit.  There are surely more archeological treasures to be discovered and researched. \u2026",
          "Great tour - especially with the guided tour via AR tablets",
          "Very impressive place - the self-guided tour is quite nice and easy to follow. Time well-spent. Nice gift shop too!",
          "Great presentation of an amazing piece of history. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I cannot understand why this is so highly rated.  It's basically an empty shell and poorly organized.  The histopad you're given to make it \"come to life\" was terrible compared to other places that have them. It didn't work automatically, 4 \u2026",
          "Is a nice place, the virtual guide tour adds some magic to the visits. My only regret is that almost 90% of what you see is not original so it is hard to get in the mood",

          "The AR experience was not something I enjoyed too much. I can see smaller children really enjoying it but I prefer to have a live tour guide. I found myself looking at the tablet more than the actual place. Unfortunately the castle itself \u2026",

          "Everyone must see the Vibrations show ! It is spellbinding",
          "A beautiful landmark to tour. The AR experience provided with easy to carry tablets makes it easy to imagine how the palace may have felt when it was inhabited and filled with dining guests. The stairs may be difficult for less mobile \u2026",

          "AMAZING! Take the virtual tour, you will not be disappointed.",
          "The Palace of the Popes is incredible in its size and presence. Even as a non Roman Catholic I found the palace to have a significant weight to it. The detail in the building is something to marvel at.\n\nKids- The I Pad tour guide provided \u2026",
          "Love this place and the story but I am Italian and have to side with the Vatican on this one. Go early and avoid all the people with Rick Steves books.",

          "Very interesting, great architecture and the histopads work really well.",
          "The Palais is a great monument to explore; it is made more exciting by the technology deployed to bring each room to life before the eyes of tourists. It is is definitely worth a visit.",

          "An absolute must see if you're into history. At first, the tablet thing felt gimmicky but it's actually a really nice tool to better understand where you are. I didn't use the earphones but the \"time portals\" were really nice",
          "A lot to see in Palais de papes!\nYou don't want to miss it...\nGrand attraction for history lovers...",
          "Massive site cannot comment as only viewd from outside. Had queued enough. Also very hot day to stand about.",

          "The house of the pope in the 14th century, it was a brilliant and well restored site which contained the history of the papel chambers before the move to Vatican city. The audio tour was also a nice way of explaining the important places to visit in the palais.",

          "Great multilingual guide through \"Histopad\" using augmented reality to bring to life.",

Shame all the cafes etc were closed for the winter.",

          "Spectacular and informative. Don't forget to pick up the enhanced reality tablet that shows you what the palace originally looked like as you walk around. And it turns out that you can't walk through a wall just because it wasn't there 600 years ago. It's also worth taking a first aid kit.",

          "Better to book in advance (I did it while queuing and skipped it). Inside there's nothing really left but the augmented reality on the \"audio-guide\" makes it up for it!",
          "The high-tech computer tablet added an extra dimension, with 360 degree views of how the palace looked - neat. Other than that,  a rather dull visit, unless you are a history junkie.",

The virtual reality on the guide really brings parts of the palace alive, however make sure you do put it down and look at the real thing as well! It does get hot in the summer so a fan might be helpful.",

          "The histopad (tablet with AR) is amazing. As you tour the palace, you scan the QR code which will allow you to see and interact with the room in the 14th century. There's also indoor positioning system so the tablet knows which room you're \u2026",
          "This is a very beautiful and very nice place to enjoy in France. I must return to see it again.",
          "It was a great tour. I'm bad at world history, so I've always thought that center of catholic church has always been in Vatican. So, lessons are learned well when I visited this palace. \n\nThe palace tour can be helped by audiovisual guide \u2026",
          "Fascinating site to visit in most major languages with a tablet provided and interactive guide throughout. If you go to Avignon without visiting the Papal Palace and the Saint Benezet bridge, it iskust as good as you have not been to Avignon at all.",
          "Fantastic experience! We bought the tickets for this and the bridge at a discounted price at the tourist information centre. A visual and audio guide is included, which is both informative and fun as it includes visuals of how the palace \u2026",

          "Great place, one of the places I wanted to visit, I'm not disappointed",
          "This building proves to me that Pope's feel they are royalist. The audio states how a woman accused of murdering her husband all property seized till she met the Pope and he purchased the town for 800 gold coins from her after blessing her. \u2026",
          "The high ratings of this place are completely understandable. Do not hesitate  to visite.",

          "Great visit lovely town",
          "It\u2019s great historical place to learn. It is quite well maintained inside with great facilities. \nBut I think the tablet device can be distraction. \nI would be great if people can choose from simply audio on small device. probably the bigger \u2026",
          "Probably a must see if in Avignon however it is not the most interesting place in the area and it is quite pricey for what it offers. Augmented reality tablets took away from the experience for me as I found myself staring at a screen rather than at the architecture itself.",
          "Free audio-video-augmented reality guide",
          "The museum was absolutely brilliant, it brings history to life",

          "I didn't see a single pope!",
          "Opulent lifestyle and taste when the Popes were the leaders of Christendom. I could not have imagined if I did not see it with my own eyes. Palace itself was astounding. Such architecture does not exist anymore, unfortunately. Loved it.",
          "The pictures of Avignon speak for themselves.  The history, the sites, the architecture is simply breathtaking.  Goes to show there are a lot more places to see in France besides Paris.",
          "Monumental building with a lot of history. Must visit!",
          "The interiors including paintings  unfortunately fragmentary preserved. Very interesting virtual tours with devices (a kind of video guide)that shows you not preserved interiors and gives supplimentary information both in audio and visual \u2026",
          "Worth a visit. Avignon is beautiul. Great campsites just across th bridge.",
          "Amazing building and exhibition, even more amazing multimedia guide. Even if you've been to every palace and cathedral in Europe, go here- the experience is unique and impressive.",
          "Nice to visit... Even Barack Obama went the day after my visit :D",

          "Palace with an important part in the history of Europe.",
          "The I-Pad cum audio guide provided very useful information and insights into the history of the palace. The I-Pad also gave us a glimpse into how life was like in the palace in the 14th Century. This attraction is the highlight of Avignon.",
          "Very impressive but empty inside... worth a visit though",
          "Massive mideival complex. Although it is empty, the audio guides and tablets digitally restores the rooms to their original grandeur.",

          "Very Nice, lovely place, they have student discount.",
          "Great place to visit, the staff was friendly and the palace was very interesting. The free audio video tour with the tablets was amazing. Whenever you scan the logo in the designated rooms you could look around and have a look in the room \u2026",
          "A great place to visit or walk by.",
          "A stunning site and beautiful to explore",

          "The interactive audio tablet was fantastic",
          "A lot of really great information in different formats. Written, tablet, and audio. I recommend going in the morning. It was very warm around 11:30 am when we went. The night lights show is a must see if you are here after dark.",
          "beautiful place to visit. Parking was a little bit tricky to find at first. but once you came up you are directly at the site. Very convenient if you are not planning a long day there. I tried the public street parking nearby but way too many people. I would say save your time just park underneath the Palais. It wasn't too expensive.",

          "A great slice of french history, Avignon becoming the capital of the Papality, for quite a while... absolutely 2 C !",
          "Beautiful!! Loved every minute",
          "Historically significant place for sure! There are histopads that help you interact with the rooms, showing them as they would have looked when the Popes lived there. The rooms are quite spare otherwise, so this made the visit more interesting. Would be neat if they had preserved some of the gardens in the courtyards.",
          "Lovely quaint little area. The Papal Palace is what you encounter after a series of souvenir shops. The cobblestone streets then lead you into a square with lots of restaurants and then on a street with shops. Lots of eating and dining \u2026",
          "The museum was amazing. They have an interactive tour guide, that really takes you to the time the pope resinged in Avignon, if you are in the area, do visit! 1,5h minimum",

          "Beautiful gothic castle with rich history overlooking the walled inner city of Avignon",
          "The iPad virtual tour of each rooms they were is a spectacular use of technology to enhance your experience. Virtual treasure hunt for kids is a added bonus. Highly recommend!",
          "Best interpretation ever seen. Modern, with a lot of interaction what is possible only with tablets. Special quest game for children and adults make it even more unique. Take ebough time for visit.",
          "Interesting history of the French Vatican. I don't usually like wearing the personal headphone narration devices so I didn't pick one up. But this one is different because it shows pictures of the rooms as they were decorated and furnished. \u2026",
          "Nice palace turned to a museum now. Best part is the audio cum video guide which will turn some room in the palace to look like as it was in the old. Loved this place. The terrace view of Avignon is marvelous.",
          "Interesting but a little sparse inside.",
          "Very cool castle with deep history!",
          "Enormous and fascinating. Well laid out displays and good room information. Allow a couple of hours and be prepared for some walking and stair climbing - but well worth the effort.",

          "Excellent place to visit the histopad brings it to life",
          "Beautiful and fill of history... The AR tour is definitely worth it.",
          "Worth the entrance fee just for the e-guide alone. Kudos to those who developed it. It was interactive & informative. I like the fact they showed us what it could've looked like.",
          "I could almost hear the angels singing, beautiful visit.",
          "A fa place of historic significance and buildings.",
          "Fascinating to hear the history of two popes at same time. Much military destruction of the Palais when they left.",
          "Amazing to see.  Say yes to the free headset and tablet tour guide.  Very helpful and gives you images of the rooms as they were.",
          "Not sure how I walk right by the self-guided iPad devices, but somehow they escaped me.   It occurred to me about 5 minutes into the tour that everyone had one but me. Lol. Just a heads up for other distracted folk like me.  That said, I still enjoyed the place, although I wasn't entirely sure what I was looking at all the time.",
          "Amazing historical palace in Avignon. Must see it!",
          "Amazing ancient architecture in ancient, preserved walled city.  Good multi-language personal guide to each historical room.  Many old artifacts on display in huge chapel.  Definitely worth the time and cost.",

          "I've always been a big history fan and this Palais was the witness and stage of major historical changes.",

          "Interesting history.  Great visual aids.",
          "If you only have time to visit one thing in Avignon then I suggest that you make it this one. Not at all expensive and you are provided with a tablet pc with headphones that you will find so useful during your visit. The tablet becomes your \u2026",
          "Even though the palace has been empty for several years its history is well presented with pads with virtual images and stories as you enter the different rooms. With this pad you can enjoy the tour at your own speed.",
          "It is a place where there are amazing views and the visual guide of a tablet is very interactive and a very interesting idea.",
          "It's a magnificent example of Middle Ages architecture and a great history lesson.  The palace, together with the medieval walls of the city, dominate the landscape from all around.  However, the interior of the building is pretty much \u2026",
          "It is very nice, but now there are also a lot of reconstructions .",
          "Impressive historic site. Well worth a visit. Especially out of the main tourist season (no queues).",
          "Nice to see in july during theatre festival",
          "Highly recommendable, take the histopad, it gives a good impression of the past splendour of the palace. It also offers a lot of additional info. Pay euro 2,50 more and you can also see the famous bridge. If you come by car, take the free \u2026",
          "Impressive and informative. A piece of Western history that shaped future centuries for all humankind.",
          "The digital experience visit is pretty good. Dont rush it, you need 4 hours to visit everything and there are so many details to check out.",
          "Walk where popes walked, ate, planned and played. Their legacy is in the beautiful little town that grew up around the palace. Many of the great things of France - lavender, pastries, clothing, art, food, etc - are here to enjoy.",
          "I think it's so interesting how the space has been converted not only into a museum for the history of the Catholic schism, but a showcase for modern art as well. Definitely a must see when in the region!",
          "One of the best augmented reality I have ever seen... it\u2019s amazing walking in that structure and having a view how the interior looked like hundreds of years ago.",
          "Magestic and awesome. The wealth of the Catholic church in 1300 was clearly beyond belief. The tablet guide was very good but one of the party had problems with it ( very low volume) that detracted from their enjoyment. Worth a visit.",
          "Honest opinion: the place is definitely worth visiting outside, the building is majestic! Going inside? Not worth a single penny, in my opinion. You get given a nice tablet audio guide, which has an indeed amazing software that guides you \u2026",
          "Very interesting building.",
          "Very interesting, beautiful view",
          "Great! Not cheap, but the 'histopad' guide makes for an interesting an fun experience",
          "Not exactly super original but still an \"incontournable\"! And the city around has so many hidden gems...",
          "the Pope wasnt even there",
          "It was fantastic to visit the building. It takes 2 hours, but it worth it. You get a tablet which guides You and shows You all the parts of the building. Amasing.",
          "Stunning views, majestic building, great guided AR tour.",
          "Interactive, self guided tour was very well done and engaging for all ages. It helped provide context for how the site has changed over the years and the role of the Popes in that era.",

          "Well maintained but no original furniture or carpets... only virtual but worth to visit",
          "Beautiful landmark.",
          "Loved the histopad to recreate the old-time scenery!",
          "A very interesting piece of history! Worth a visit! The audioguide is an interactive pad from Huawei which uses Augmented Reality to render the halls as they might have been in the 14th Century. Check the kitchen!",
          "Interesting use of technology to enhance the visit, but not always intuitive to use.  Very little ventilation so on hot days , it is oppressively hot.  Don't expect the grandeur of the Vatican.  Lots of imagination per use the technology to get a better sense.",
          "A simply stunning place, definitely the main landmark of Avignon. It looks different at different times of the day but is always imposing. Do go inside, you won't be disappointed.",
          "Admission is 12 Eur (+ optional 2EUR for the bridge), you get a laptop with an audio guide and 3D projections. Worth visiting!",
          "An extremely interesting tour. The audio visual headsets added a great amount of information. Lots of steps.",
          "Absolutely worth the visit even though quite pricey (50\u20ac for a family). The multimedia tablets are very informative and the AR applications give an idea how the rooms looked like 700yrs ago. At the same time it\u2019s a bit distracting so that at times you are so busy with the treasure hunt that you forget the real environment...",
          "The tablet guide was a great invention!",
          "Really enjoyed the ipad tour. The virtual experience added so much to the visit. The content was informative and the rendition of the room help increase the understanding and appreciation of the palace. Great way to bring history to life.",
          "Great place, so much to see.",
          "Nice walk around the Pope's former residence. They tried hard to make it flashy with virtual reality and tablets, and despite my sceptisism it does work. There are some impressive murals and architecture.",
          "It's a good walk back in time of when popes lived in Avignon. the guided visit with the \"histopads\" is well done and intuitive. Fun for solo and family travel.",
          "Must see",
          "The augmented reality tablets are well done and immersive.\nIt was ridiculously hot though, because no windows were open and the whole thing heated up like an oven.\nThere is a coin hunt on the tablets for kids.\n2 criticisms- coin hunt should \u2026",
          "The open space and grandeur",
          "Great tablet based tour! Great for kids too with embedded treasure hunt. Buy tickets in advance online to bypass line.",
          "Fabulous site to visit. Didn't think I would want to emerse myself in the technological guide, but using it really enhanced my visit. However, I loved the wall paintings, which unfortunately you couldn't take photographs of - even without flash on camera.",
          "A place worth an holiday. Stunning palaces and architecture all around",
          "Fabulous. Large open square. Lots of cafes. Tourist train . Museum. Walk to the top to see park and views across the river and famous bridge. Excellent for sitting and watching",
          "Didn't quite know what to expect. But this is one of those visits you will remember for a long time.  Very well presented by the organization. You'll need a couple of hours to tour this place. Staff are very resourceful and helpful. \nA return visit for sure. Thank you Avignon!",
          "They have a self guided tour using tablet devices now that recognizes your location and shows you the room as it may have existed during the time being discussed. Really a neat thing and made the history come alive.",
          "I love the Palais des Papes. Views of the city and of the river unparalleled. Wonderfully maintained, with a rich history. Nice little gift shop inside the church. I visit the palais every time I'm in Avignon.",
          "This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that this is a wonderful historical site. What might come as a surprise is the use of technology. The included AR experience provides a great window into the palace as it was lived.",
          "Really remind me of Attack of Titan when seeing the gorgeous barbican and wall.Videoguide is also awesome.",
          "stunning to see, don\u2019t miss it. The sheer opulence of how the catholic church conducted itself is on display and worth seeing for all. the VR tour seemed like a gimmick at first, but it is actually a nice touch to give you a feel of the palace in its prime.",
          "Excellent historical monument. Thanks.",

          "Full of history and views. Worth of revisiting but not in summer time.",
          "The roof observation deck gives a great view. Guided navigation gives ample information about medieval political turmoil. Good for a 4- hr visit",
          "Large unadorned rooms without much explanation. Historical presentation lacking. Read up before visiting.",
          "The tablet guide with AR mappings of the rooms is amazing! Really makes the place come alive. Every castle should do this.",
          "Iconic place !",
          "Absolutely awesome and their tablet guide is fantastic",
          "Awesome, as one could guess !",
          "Exciting and very unexpected visit to the place due to the innovative history through modern IT technology of pseudo-virtualisation. Immerse yourself into the time of pope's time in medieval Avignon. Would certainly recommend and come back again for more treasure hunt.",
          "I somehow expected more of the palace itself.  It's been turned into a sort of space for modern art.  However,  there is a rich history behind the place that is very interesting. I recommend getting the audio guides or at least reading all the placards.\n\nThere is a 7 minute movie on the first floor.   Don't miss it!",
          "The tour is not worth it: a bunch of empty rooms and a few recovered artifacts.",

          "Very interesting audio video guide",
          "Old castle with a cool visual/audio guide.  Castle has minimal furnishings but a tablet/audio guide bring the Castle to life with interactive imagery.",
          "Outstanding technology to take you back to medieval period.  Know that the tour includes many stairs and uneven walkways and cobblestones of the Middle Ages.",
          "Very high price (12 euros) for a person. Park is free and quite good, but toilets are terrible",
          "The tour is enhanced with the tablets that useQR Codes to get information about the areas is the Palace.  A lot of history.",
          "The Histopad is great! You get to see what some rooms used to look like. Interesting and educational, so great for kids too.",

          "A huge, grand, incredible papal Palace. A fascinating place to visit. Numerous rooms are open to the public, including grand meeting rooms, and small but elaborately painted chapels (viewable from the doorway). A truly fantastic place to visit",

          "After the visit ,to the palace just rownd the corner is some very nice restaurants",
          "Nice palace to visit. It\u2019s rather well preserved and has some interesting information. If you go up the towers and walls you can get some nice views of the area. The Pont d\u2019avignon is also near by and worth checking out.",
          "Amazing media experience inside.  Highly recommend",
          "Beautiful ancient building with a fascinating background story. The entrance fee is rather high but is well worth it because you get an awesome audio-/video guide. The guide is one of the best I've ever seen. It can actually revive the past!!",

          "You must use the audio guide. It's phenomenal!",
          "I am not mad about historical sites but this one I was keen to see. No regards. Knowing that it used to be pop\u2019s residence it cannot be compared to Vatican. Great castel, unfortunately it gets renovated which spoils the scenery. I would definitely recommend to visit.\nLeave your car outside of the old city, 20 minutes enjoyable walk.",
          "Loved the Augmented Reality system.",
          "One of the best museum, i've ever visited",
          "Great historic place, very well organized tour and multimedia guide ; Recommend visiting in the spring.",
          "It was under construction when we came. The weather was super hot (around 38 degree) and it was quite stuffy inside. The AR experience was quite cool with little treasure hunt games",

          "Great place for tourists and for taking photos.",

          "At the time of my visit they were doing some restoration on the outside but it was still spectacular and the experience was very good.

          "This is the Papal palace of popes when several of them were French. It is the main part of Avignon France. It is found inside a walled city and you could get lost for hours or days checking out the palaces and surrounding shops. Check \u2026",
          "Good audio guide which would be better if you could  \nZoom in on the details of the ceilings. Without the guide it's an empty she'll but the admission charge reflects that.",
          "Amazing free audioguide, interactive with virtual reconstruction of the various rooms and even a treasure hunt! Made the whole experience so much better.",

          "Worth a visit. The mixed reality aspect of the \"audio guide\" kept my younger kids interested as they searched for hidden coins in each room and being able to see what the rooms would have looked like via the Android tablet was novel.",

          "A very lovely place. I love the whole building architecture and we had a great time walking around every corner inside. Too bad it's only open until 7 pm so when I visited the place I came quite late so I didn't have much time to explore \u2026",
          "Extensive palaces, complimented by some GPS tablet technology enabling you to examine rooms as they were in the past, just by pointing towards the walls.  Further depth of information by pressing Query symbols and games for the children. \u2026",
          "Beautifull attraction, a must see.",
          "A nice excursion while traveling on the Viking Star. Very interesting history of Popes when they were not living in Rome in the 1300's. A nice town and many good restaurants.",

          "+JMJ...Phenomenal tourist attraction!  Visited here in the late 1980s when the ship I was deployed on did a Mediterranean Cruise.  For leisure experiences, tours are scheduled for ship crew.  At the time, I didn't realize it's religious \u2026",
          "This was an amazing place to visit even during the Theatre festival which lasts most of July. They are still actively restoring areas and will continue to open up more areas to the public. There are some famous paintings and other art \u2026",
          "One of the must-see places in Avignon! Get the tickets for both the Palais and the bridge. Stunning architecture and really interesting story about the Popes the used to live there.",
          "Very good place to visit if you like the history with technology you can see hows the place looks like before. Its bring you back to in the year of 1300. Take a morning visit so the rest of the day you can visit others. The ticket plus pond d\u2019avignon is \u20ac14.5.",

          "Well worth a visit .",
          "One of the coolest castles in France!",
          "Very interesting history but there is a surprising lack of information as you walk through the rooms. Tablets are handed out with info, so everyone is walking around with electronics. It\u2019s neat, but there should be analog as well.",
          "Way more interesting than I had imagined.",
          "The structure is quite well preserved/restructured but there are no furniture and the Wall paintings are few. The entrance are 12 euros, a bit too much to my opinion, but it comes with an ipad guide in many languages and with a special \u2026",

        "wiki": "Montpellier (UK: , US: , French: [m\u0254\u0303p\u0259lje, -p\u025bl-] (listen); Occitan: Montpelhi\u00e8r [mumpe\u02c8\u028e\u025b]) is a city near the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the H\u00e9rault department. It is located in the Occitanie region. In 2016, 607,896 people lived in the urban area and 281,613 in the city itself. Nearly one third of the population are students from three universities and from three higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city.\n\n\n== Status ==\nMontpellier is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice. It is the 7th-largest city of France, and is also the fastest-growing city in the country over the past 25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area, but raids by pirates encouraged settlement a little further inland. Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local feudal dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin mons pislerius, referring to the woad used for dyeing locally. The two surviving towers of the city walls, the Tour des Pins and the Tour de la Babotte, were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century\u2014as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of Muslims, Jews and Cathars\u2014and later of its Protestants. William VIII of Montpellier gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad of Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III; the medicine faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the Kings of Aragon in 1204 by the marriage of Peter II of Aragon with Marie of Montpellier, who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her dowry.\nMontpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the Black Death. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to James III of Majorca, who sold the city to the French king Philip VI in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with Peter IV of Aragon. In the 14th century, Pope Urban VIII gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from Maguelone in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, Jacques C\u0153ur established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the province of Languedoc.\n\n\n=== After the Reformation ===\nAt the time of the Reformation in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or Huguenots as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. In 1622, King Louis XIII besieged the city which surrendered after a two-month siege (Siege of Montpellier), afterwards building the Citadel of Montpellier to secure it. Louis XIV made Montpellier capital of Bas Languedoc, and the town started to embellish itself, by building the Promenade du Peyrou, the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre. After the French Revolution, the city became the capital of the much smaller H\u00e9rault.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nDuring the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s a fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine. After this the city had grown because it welcomed immigrants from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after Algeria's independence from France. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number 7th and 8th largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-third of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture, though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also has such developments as the Corum and the Antigone that have attracted an increasing number of students.\n\n\n=== Lords of Montpellier ===\n\nWilliam I of Montpellier (died 1019)\nWilliam II of Montpellier (died 1025)\nWilliam III of Montpellier (died 1058)\nWilliam IV of Montpellier (died 1068)\nWilliam V of Montpellier (died 1121)\nWilliam VI of Montpellier (died 1149)\nWilliam VII of Montpellier (died 1179)\nWilliam VIII of Montpellier (died 1202)\nMarie of Montpellier (died 1213)\nand King Peter II of Aragon (died 1213)\nJames I of Aragon (died 1276)\nJames II of Majorca (died 1311)\nSancho of Majorca (died 1324)\nJames III of Majorca (died 1349)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated on hilly ground 10 km (6 mi) inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the River Lez. The name of the city, which was originally Monspessulanus, is said to have stood for mont pel\u00e9 (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or le mont de la colline (the mount of the hill)\nMontpellier is located 170 km (106 mi) from Marseille, 242 km (150 mi) from Toulouse, and 748 km (465 mi) from Paris.\nMontpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of 57 m (187 ft). The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelli\u00e9ret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontpellier has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), with mild, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers.

And in a study made by INSEE from 2007 to 2012 Montpellier saw the strongest population growth of France's main communes (+1.1%), ahead of Paris and Lyon. In 2011, the estimated population of the metropolitan area was 561,326.For most of its history, and even today, Montpellier is known for its significant Spanish population, heritage and influence. Montpellier also houses important Moroccan, Algerian, and Italian communities.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe main focus point of the city is the Place de la Com\u00e9die, with the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die built in 1888.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Fabre.\nIn the historic centre, a significant number of h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. mansions) can be found. The majority of the buildings of the historic centre of Montpellier (called the \u00c9cusson because its shape is roughly that of an escutcheon) have medieval roots and were modified between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Some buildings, along Rue Foch and the Place de la Com\u00e9die, were built in the 19th century.\nThe Rue du Bras de Fer (Iron Arm Street) is very typical of the medieval Montpellier.\nThe mikve, ritual Jewish bath, dates back to the 12th century and is one of very few in Europe.\nThe Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\u2014oldest botanical garden in France, founded in 1593\nThe La Serre Amazonienne, a tropical rain forest greenhouse\nThe 14th-century Saint Pierre Cathedral\nThe Porte du Peyrou, a triumphal arch built at the end of the 17th century, and the Place Royal du Peyrou built in the 17th century, are the highest point of the Ecusson.\nThe Tour des Pins, the only remaining of 25 towers of the city medieval walls, built around 1200.\nThe Tour de la Babotte, a medieval tower which was modified in the 18th century to house an observatory.\nThe Saint Cl\u00e9ment Aqueduct, built in the 18th century.\nThe Antigone District and other housing projects have been designed by the architect Ricardo Bofill from Catalonia, Spain\nA number of ch\u00e2teaux, so-called follies, built by wealthy merchants surround the city\nNearly 80 private mansions were built in the city from the 17th to 19th century, and some of their interior courtyards are open\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe University of Montpellier is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach and confirmed by Pope Nicholas IV in a papal bull of 1289. It was suppressed during the French Revolution but was\nre-established in 1896.\nIt is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna University, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The school of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Muslim Spain medical schools; it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of Honorius III, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne. Pope Nicholas IV issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.\nTheology was at first taught in the convents, in which St. Anthony of Padua, Raymond Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when Calvinism, in the reign of Henry II of France, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers Guillaume de Nogaret, chancellor to Philip the Fair, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, antipope as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under Henry IV of France, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon.\nThe Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734\u20131806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.\nThe faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention\u2014which has since been realized\u2014of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nUniversity of Montpellier 1: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, law, business, sports\nMontpellier 2 University: sciences\nPaul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III: arts, languages and social sciencesUniversity of Montpellier 1 and University of Montpellier 2 reunified in January 2015 to form the University of Montpellier.

Line 1 runs from Mosson in the west to Odysseum in the east. Line 2 runs from Jacou in the northeast to St. Jean-de-Vedas in the southwest. Line 3 and Line 4 opened in April 2012. Line 3, which is 22.4-kilometre (13.9 mi) long, links Juvignac and Perols with a branch to Lattes and serves 32 stations.

Many places in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland carry the name Montpellier. Often they are in resort locations claiming some of the healthy attributes for which the French city was renowned in earlier centuries. The variant spelling \"Montpelier\" is common, and is of quite early provenance. Brewer uses that spelling. The first example was the early 19th-century suburb of Montpelier in Brighton.The capital of the American state of Vermont was named Montpelier because of the high regard in which the Americans held the French who had aided their Revolutionary War against the British. Several other American cities are also named Montpelier.\nPlaces named Montpellier/Montpelier are also found in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the H\u00e9rault department\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Montpellier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\"Montpellier\", A handbook for travellers in France, London: John Murray, 1861, OL 24627024M\n\"Montpellier\".

          "Liked the exhibition and the commentary which almost made sense of Miro's art which in itself is well worth viewing. The gallery is laid out well and the pictures easy to see. The resident exhibition is OK but probably not worth a trip on its own. The gallery has a restaurant",
          "contemporary art floor was rubbish but I enjoyed the rest of the works and the gallery itself is a nice venue",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to both the gallery and the restaurant, with fantastic views of the Mediterannean. What a great location, with wonderful a wonderful art collection in a light and airy gallery!",
          "very fine art gallery, beautiful modern paintings, one room dedicated to Val\u00e9ry, a couple of rooms of local painters - really enjoyable afternoon",
          "The gallery is next to the interesting old cemetery and well worth 2-3 hours of your time, depending what exhibition they are showing to supplement their worthwhile resident works (good 17th century Dutch, Flemish as well as French artists) At our visit, there were French",
          "This gallery always punches above its weight and exhibitions during the summer are invariably interesting. Well worth a visit.",
          "Compact visiting collection of Impressionists well worth an hour or so and much easier to digest than the major national museums. The permanent exhibition is fairly small but has good local atmosphere (and some seriously weird contemporary stuff).",
          "We were lucky to see an excellent exhibition of works mainly from the impressionists which was on temporary view. The regular exhibits are also worth seeing with a very nice collection of Valery's poems, letters and pictures. Beautifully situated with views of the Med and a nice",
          "This is a wonderful museum and they always have very interesting visiting exhibits; we've been going at least annually for about a decade and look forward each time we return. Also, enjoy the view after you've parked.",
          "I have been here three times - always great exhibitions on expressionism (Raoul Dufy, Auguste Chabaud, ...) - great setting. Just the car parking is a bit small and wild.",
          "The Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry in S\u00e8te, France is a wonderful small art museum with a particular focus on Paul Val\u00e9ry, the French poet. There is a room dedicated to him with books and pages of his poetry plus some of his drawings and small artworks. In addition this terrific little",
          "Viewed the Chabaud exhibition with friends. I had never heard of the artist previously so this for me was a new and exciting experience. I would recommend this exhibition highly",
          "The permanent collection is well worth visiting again & again & the special exhibitions they put on are well curated & easy to access",
          "When we visited the Chabaud exhibit was on display and while I'm not a big fan of Chabaud, I did like the permanent collection which was impressive for such a small museum. All artwork is by French artists and covers most genres - it's quite beautiful and worth a visit.",
          "There is a temporary exhibition by Chabaud, fauvism and impressionism, and the decorative installations outside garden is also nice. On your walk up to the museum, you can see the fantastic view of Sete. Very nice",
          "Glorious exhibition in the (fairrly) rrecently refurbished Paul Valery. Curious choice of wall colour but a superb exhibition by a superb curator who has moved fom Lodeve to S\u00e8te. There is a professionalism in theis mus\u00e9e that marks it above many of it's contemporaries.",
          "This art museum is excellent for such a small town. There are local artists on the bottom floor and exhibitions on the second. The paintings are from the period 1840 - 1940 or so.",
          "Best view in Sete and a good place for a coffee or meal. Permanent collection good - touring some really good works"

        "wiki": "Marseillan is a commune in the H\u00e9rault department in southern France.\nIt lies some 50 km (31 mi) west of Montpellier.\nMarseillan sits on a large lagoon, the \u00c9tang de Thau, and is the southern entreport for the Canal du Midi.\nThe centre of the village lies within the lines of the old walls. There is a hotel and a number of cafes and restaurants. Marseillan Plage is a purpose-built holiday resort on the Mediterranean, some 3 km (1.9 mi) from Marseillan Ville.\nThe port is a protected heritage site, and the altar and organ in the church are also listed. There has been virtually no new building in the heart of the village since the 17th century, and many of the houses date from the twelfth century.\nUntil 1970 the vineyards came to the main boulevards built outside the line of the walls around 1870. Since then the population has grown from around 3,000 throughout the last 200 years to over 10,000 in 2010. This does not include those who have bought houses and villas in Marseillan but use them only as holiday homes. Expectation is that the population will top 14,000 by 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere is dispute as to who exactly founded the village. Marseille claims that honour, largely due to the similarity between the names of the two towns. But both names are derived from the Greco/Phoenician Massaliotes who extended trading routes from the eastern Mediterranean.\nThe Massaliotes certainly founded Marseille around 600 BC and, shortly after, Agde. Thus, Agde is said to be the second oldest town in France. The foundation of Marseillan, however, is less clear. As Agde is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away it seems most likely that the Agatois were the founders. In any case, the origins of all three places lie with the Greco/Phoenicians. And, either way, Marseillan is one of the oldest villages in France.\nThe Romans established the port, and with the Via Domitia running close they also established a rest and recreation centre. Many legionnaires took their discharge at Marseillan, and with it a grant of land - on which they grew vines.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nMarseillan's economy is founded on fish, wines, trade and visitors. This has always been so because from its foundation Marseillan has been a major trading centre, a port and a stopping-off point for travellers.\n\n\n=== Trade ===\nWhen the village was founded there was a clean inland waterway paralleling the Mediterranean - described as \"une petite mer int\u00e9rieure et tranquille\". Thus sailors could make their way in safety from the Rh\u00f4ne to Marseillan. Thus from the beginning Marseillan was a trading post.\nOver the years this waterway silted up, forming the series of Etangs, the largest of which being the \u00c9tang de Thau, but then the Canal du Midi opened and Marseillan, as the Entreport, was a major beneficiary.\nIt follows that from the very early days Marseillan had the four bases of trade that exist today.\nMuch later Marseillan was linked by the Rhone-S\u00e8te Canal to the river Rhone and by the Canal du Midi to Toulouse and thence to the Atlantic at Bordeaux. Its location means that Marseillan became a crucial link in the network of canals that still encircle France.\n\n\n=== Fishing ===\nThe \u00c9tang de Thau is shallow, with a bottom of foot-deep mud. The conditions are perfect for shellfish and 18 different sorts are fished from the Etang. As the water is Class A they can be eaten straightaway. Most notable are the oysters and the mussels.\n\u2018Bouziques\u2019 oysters, from the \u00c9tang, provide about 10% of France's annual oyster consumption. They are cultivated from oyster tables with one farmer able to bring up a family comfortably on the production from two tables.\nMussels are taken from the rich band of mussel-friendly water that runs along the Mediterranean coast from Marseillan to Marseilles. Marseillan fishers work 3 km from the shore, with the Agatois in larger boats fishing further out.\nSea fish are also caught in the \u00c9tang. They are carried in by the force of the current generated by the narrowness of the canals. (There are no tides on the Mediterranean, but the mass of water shifts dependent on the prevailing wind. Thus the level of the \u00c9tang is constantly shifting.)\n\n\n=== Wines ===\nTable wines are produced, with the most acceptable being Picpoul de Pinet - an attractive white wine with a slight green tint and a little sparkle. About a million bottles annually are produced by the cave co-operative.\nThe Noilly Prat company came to Marseillan in 1853, and is still producing its vermouths on the same site. Mr Noilly had created the vermouth in Lyon in 1813. His son, with an English partner (Mr Prat), came to Marseillan to commercialise their product because the local wines were very suitable and the climate was ideal.\n\n\n=== Visitors ===\nAlways a stopping point on the long routes along the Mediterranean shore Marseillan has provided travellers with a welcome since the village was founded.\nToday much of the village's prosperity comes from the summer visitors: holidaymakers in Marseillan Plage, day visitors to Marseillan Ville, houseboat visitors from the Canal du Midi and owners of holiday homes.\nTo some degree even those northerners who have settled permanently are visitors. Certainly they make a substantial contribution to the local economy.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Fortification ===\nThe old village has remained unchanged through the centuries, and today's village is almost identical in shape to the one known in the Middle Ages. This is because Marseillan was a fortified village until late in the 18th century.\nFrom the second century BC Marseillan was protected by earthworks, but by Roman times it had a timber stockade. This was sufficient until Simon de Montfort and his army passed through during the Cathar Crusade. New stone fortifications then replaced the timber.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau sat foursquare in the centre of the village, behind its own walls, whilst the village walls were themselves four-and-a-half metres high. There were four gates, six watchtowers and the village was moated.\n\n\n=== Habitation ===\nMost of the village houses are back-to-back. Typically they are of three storeys. A stable on the ground floor, living space on the first and fodder stored on the second. The rear rooms are without light or ventilation. With the houses protected from mosquitoes by zinc screens, and in the heat of the Midi, it must have been barely tolerable even to people born into the village. Today the mosquitoes have been eradicated, but it is still uncomfortable in the rear rooms in high summer.\nMost houses in the old village are small or very small. Their staircases are narrow, and twisty.\nSome larger homes were owned by the entrepreneurs who typically moved out of the village and into the main boulevards from around 1870.\nThese new large homes were also working houses. Maisons de ma\u00eetre and maisons de vigneron have no particular architectural style, but they are all of two or three storeys, with the ground floor a working area. All have double doors to allow entry to the horse-drawn transport. Sometimes there was direct access from the rear of the house to the vineyards. Almost always there was a small kitchen garden and a pump.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nConstruction is typically of \u2018torchis\u2019 bricks made from sun dried clay and straw. There are no foundations because a metre down is the water table. Every house in Marseillan has rising damp. This is actually essential to the survival of the houses since they have to be built to withstand the climate changes.\nIn the winter the ground expands, and in summer it contracts. The houses have to be able to flex to cope with these changes. So lime mixed with sand from the beach was used rather than cement (which hardly flexes), and cracks in the fa\u00e7ade are normal. Some houses are built from soft limestone which was taken from the vineyards. Basalt, hard volcanic stone, is commonly used for door and window frames.\nIt is not uncommon to find that houses have been adapted and renovated over the ages and many have several different building materials co-existing within the one building. Renovation is not a modern initiative, Marseillan houses have been renovated and adapted since they were first built.\nToday bathrooms have been added, but piped water and sanitation have only been in the village since 1958. Most houses had their private pump, however.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMarseillan enjoys an equable climate. Sheltered by the mountains of the Massif Central the weather systems from the north are seldom a problem. Marseillan has some 300 sunny days a year, and ground frosts (at worst) in mid-winter. From time-to-time a little snow falls, but this only dusts the ground and is gone by mid-day. Marseillanais make day trips into the mountains to experience snowballing and to make snowmen.\nThe prevailing winds are from the south-west, and south. Marseillan receives the hot winds from the Sahara but does not suffer the pink sand that those winds carry out to sea. The Mistral blows down the Rhone valley and, although a northerly wind is sometimes referred to as a \u201cmistral\u201d it has none of the severity nor persistence of the true version.\n\n\n== Of interest ==\nThe Marseillanais have always taken their time over decisions, but have still been leaders in many areas. A hospital existed in 1,100 and is still treating patients today (having had several homes over the years!). The maire (mayor) was elected in the village 200 years before this was required by Royal decree. Public schooling started in the mid-18th century. The school was co-educational from 1870 (but not the classes). The oldest stone Marianne in France was erected in 1878, following a wooden bust created in 1876. Marseillan voted to become secular some 10 years before the country as a whole. Women were allowed into one designated cafe from 1870 \u2014 again earlier than most other towns and villages.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nAchille Maffre de Baug\u00e9  (1855-1928), poet\nMarcel Barral (known as Marcel Viala) (1912-1997, poet\nPierre Deley, one of the first pilots of the A\u00e9ropostale and grandnephew of G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Roques\nGeneral Pierre Auguste Roques (28 December 1856 - 1920), founder of French military aviation, Minister of War 1916.

          "We only had time to pop in for a quick drink! Unfortunately we didn\u2019t take the tour but will definitely give it a go next year. We ordered cocktails on the terrace. You could either blend your own using a menu of ingredients for \u20ac5 or choose one from the existing menu for",
          "Absolutely fascinating tour. Really interesting to learn about the various plants added to create the flavours, and it\u2019s all done by hand! The tour guide was extremely informative and friendly, encouraging us to ask questions at any time. The tour finished with a tasting",
          "A very informative and well thought out experience. Our guide Pascal was very knowledgable and as well as sharing lots of interesting facts about the history and the process to make Noilly Prat was also able to answer lots of our questions. This tour is worth a visit if you are",
          "Visited Maison Noilly Prat on 4th July 2018, Pascal was our tour guide and he could not of been better. His knowledge is flawless, of the history, the foundation, the recipe, the cooperage! Be sure to enjoy a cocktail at the bar in the end. Highly recommend.",
          "We popped in for a tasting. There is an English tour once a day and we had missed this on the day of our visit so we just bought a bottle and enjoyed the tasting.",
          "The tour last 45 minutes, English tours at 11 & 15:00 daily. All staff seemed to speak some English though. They are part of Bacardi-Martini, but the operation in Marseillan has the feel of a small independent company, focused solely on Noilly-Prat, which, I have to say does",
          "Very happy with the inciteful tour. Pascal our guide was very accommodating and the tasting was better than i was expecting considering I didn't consider myself a vermouth drinker in particular. I enjoyed learning about the traditional methods of production and the classy VIP",
          "I didn't think this would be very interesting but the guide was superb. In detail history of Noilly Prat , followed by a tour of the museum. An in depth tasting which really rounded off this tour .",
          "We were spending at day at Cap d'Agde Naturist Village and on the way out of town, we decided to stop in at Noilly Prat in Marseillan, France. Marseillan is a cute little beach town with a large marina. Located next to the marina area is Maison Noilly Pratt. We stopped in",
          "The tour at Noilly Prat was very interesting and included the tasting of different varieties. Delicious products are available at attached shop and cocktails at the bar. It took us 3 attempts until we could attend a tour in German though because we received wrong information",
          "I was concerned when I arrived having booked our English tour for 4 people on Viator, and the staff said they had us booked in for a different time. But within ten minutes we had our own personal tour guide Pascal, who was so passionate about his job, very funny, knowledgeable",
          "Amazing experience for those who want to understand how vermouth is produced. Our guide, Pascal, was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. And, of course, the vermouth is exceptional.",
          "We did the English speaking tour at 3pm and the guide was outstanding. We learned loads and enjoyed the tasting afterwards. The staff were all so friendly and courteous we went back several times again to have a glass of Noilly Prat rouge whilst sitting in the sunny",
          "We visited during one of the English Speaking tours of which there are 1 or 2 daily depending on the season. The tour took about 45 minutes and is really interesting - great to see such an old process still in use in an original premises. Samples at the end were worth the price",
          "Very informative tour of the NP cellar and old part of the factory. Now part of Bacardi it keeps its unique family feel,producing vermouth still using some traditional methods. English tours at 10.30 and 3pm . Tasting four different NPs and opportunity to taste more cocktails",
          "You cannot visit without trying an original dry gin martini... also cater for kids with sorbets and soft drinks... well worth a visit every time we are in the area",
          "What a great find. We booked to stay in Marseillan for a few nights knowing nothing about the area. We had no idea that Noilly Prat was produced here. We asked the staff for advice on the best experience and were told the cocktail tour was great. They were not wrong. After a",
          "We opted for the visit and then the cocktail making workshop. After a brusk reception we started our tour which was in french as the group was predominantly french/Belgian. My wife and I were surprised how much we were able to follow and we were also supplied with an English",
          "An hour well spent. The tour guide was very knowledgable and interesting. Tasted all the types of Noilly Prat and given a further one of our choice. Very interesting and highly recommended.",
          "I've drink my share of Noilly Pratt vermouth in the past but in truth had no idea how it was made, or where.....such an informative tour, about the right length, very reasonably priced and enough details to keep the most curious of minds satisfied. All the staff we encountered",
          "Who knew you could drink vermouth sans martini??? Private tour conducted by an English speaking employee. What a great sense of history, pride and quality was displayed. An who knew you could age win in the heat and sun of the Mediterranean!",
          "We booked the 15euro tour each and it was well worth each cent. Pascal was our tour guide. He was so knowledgeable and his English was perfect. Pascal was our personal guide which gave us plenty of opportunity to ask questions. The information was fascinating and the tour great",
          "This was a fun tour round Noilly Prat in English (11 and 3pm tours are in English) Pascal was a great host..interesting and amusing. Noilly Prat positions itself as the premier Vermouth producer in France (low volumes, traditional methods and high quality) and based on the tour",
          "Lovely staff who served us whilst we bought a bottle, but we were too late at 1830 on a Sunday in June. Beautiful inside courtyard and extremely knowledgable staff",
          "We decided to visit the Maison Noilly Prat after visiting an old monastary. What a choice. We had a tour in English to ourselves with the lovely Catherine who spoke excellent English and really made our visit with her explainations of the process. after the visit came the",
          "We decided to book the longer tour of this Distillery. We have learnt over the years of travelling, that the slightly more expensive tours actually reap you a more enjoyable tour. We booked and paid online. Lisette took 6 of us around the Distillery, taking about 1 and 1/4",
          "This is one place that is well worth a visit! Guided tours are conducted in both French and English - very interesting and everything is beautifully presented. We went with friends from the UK and had lunch at a restaurant on the other side of the canal which was also",
          "We turned up and like most places they were closed 12-2 so we booked on the internet for a tour at 2.45 but they told us the tour in English wasn't until 3 and swapped us. We had Pascal show us round and he was funny and informative. There is a tasting at the end and we",
          "We really enjoyed learning how Noilly Prat is made from an English-speaking guide. It's very interesting seeing the various stages of the process and the tasting at the end is fun. The buildings are historic, with a lovely courtyard in the middle that has benches to sit on in",
          "lovely in Quiet port a, very interesting to visit whistst looking round in marseillan lovely port of marseillan",
          "What can I say that has not been mentioned in the hundreds of previous reviews. This is a fascinating and educational tour learning about the history and manufacturing process. What I can emphasize is the courtesy and warmth of the staff! Olivia in public relations who helped me",
          "The tour is very interesting and ends with a tasting of all four kinds of Noilly Prat. The location is worth a visit and the tour guide spoke excellent English, and answered all questions in a lively manner. Not to be missed when in Marseillan.",
          "A very friendly place to visit whilst looking round this lovely port of Marseillan, guided tours which show you the making and maturing of the Nolly Prat, a hidden secret with its barrel filled court yard just meters from the sea. A good tasting session follows and the Ambre",
          "Having visited the area and it's attractions a lot I was happy to find a new place to visit but didn't have high expectations. This place can't be accused of over promoting itself, in fact it could easily be overlooked but you'd be missing a treat. Situated in a side street in",
          "What a fun and interesting tour we had. Our guide, Pascal, was very entertaining and knowledgeable about the process of making Vermouth. The tasting at the end of the tour was especially enlightening for someone like me who doesn't drink this stuff regularly. I can highly",
          "Our knowledgable and charming English speaking guide Antonia, gave us a fabulous insight into the history and making of the different vermouths whilst we were shown around the interesting exhibits. The finale was when Antonia expertly presented the Ambre, Rouge and Original Dry",
          "Excellent taste of wine and choclate Nice tour around the winery and a good taste of wines afterwards.",
          "Wonderful learning about the history of this delicious aperitif. You'll be able to sample all four of their drinks, plus have the option of mixing your own drink after. The \"Amber\" is only available here, so stock up. Lovely spot, fun tour and reasonable price.",
          "While in Marseillan, a visit to the French vermouth factory of Noilly Prat is a must. We arrived shortly after ten and were welcomed by a lovely classy lady. We only had to wait about five minutes for a short guided tour (in French) for which no reservation was needed. Our",

          "Escaping the crowded beach, a friend suggested a tour at Noilly Prat. A real treat. The tour is affordable and first class. The guide spoke many languages and knew the history of making Vermouth and made it both informative and entertaining. We had no idea how good vermouth",
          "Its very interesting to discover the history of this product very famous in France at the beginning of the 20th century and reborn as a popular cocktail base for new mixologue bartenders. The visit centre is very well done and the outdoor ageing court very impressive. The herbal",

          "We were lucky enough to have a private tour of the site - and what a treasure it is! Well worth the 7.50 euros for a genuine slice of French wine/vermouth making history. Highly recommend a visit!",

          "I had no idea of the complexities in the production and artistry required to create Vermouth. The guided tour is well worth the money and culminates with a fantastic tasting!",
          "This is a genuinely very interesting historic tour - its not a winery - there's a real (secret) recipe needed to make this vermouth - the trip is an absolute must Recommendation - pay extra for the one hour trip - don't go for the express tour",
          "We visited here several years ago on our first visit to the area. We were taken on the tour in a small group by a lady who spoke perfect English. An interesting diversion for an hour or two.",

          "Noliiy Prat (rhymes with 'cat') came to Marseillan in the mid 1800s because of the quality of the wine and access to the Canal du Midi. The tour shows one exactly how Noilly Prat is made (but they won't give away which of the herbs they show you actually go into the product).",
          "Very interesting place to visit and where you will learn about vermouth for sure. A stop for sure...",
          "Not something we'd drink much of ourselves, but an interesting place to drop into after lunch in Marseillan. The young man (Jonathon?) who explained the process of producing the liquor to us was very knowledgeable and had excellent English. Worth a few minutes of your time.",
          "I love Noilly Prat and seeing how it is made and where it comes from was really special. Must purchase some Noilly Ambre as this us the only place you can get it. A lovely respite in touring",
          "Interesting tour of the factory, seeing how Noilly Prat is made and hearing some of the history. Tasting of all three varieties was available at the end, and it tasted all the better for knowing a bit about how it was made.",
          "We had a really fascinating tour (in english) from the Noilly Prat guide Nathalie. Much better than any other winery or cognac place we've visited. She was so jolly, enthusiastic, and well informed, we felt we were almost visiting her house!. The place itself smells exotically",
          "Noilly Prat have just begun to offer lunches and dinners from 'artisan' producers. We had Sunday lunch there and were pleasantly surprised by the offerings! We both opted for the tasting menu which comprised a beautiful presentation of seasonal vegetables, charcuterie, cheeses,",

          "Visited the Noilly Prat 'factory' - by accident. Was vaguely aware of the drink but now know all about it thanks to a 'private' evening tour with the cellar master. A limited number of people - ten I think - get to do a personal tour with the cellar master and hear all about",
          "Interesting and informative tour, great value. The tour guides are friendly and welcoming. The tour was entertaining. Excellent value.",
          "Wonderful time spent at noilly Prat. Very gentle informative way to spend the morning. My two teenagers enjoyed it. The tour (excellent guide Lisa) was in French and English and explained the production of noily Prat, followed by a tasting. No hard sell, however we did buy some",
          "Took the tour in English this afternoon. Already knew how this vermouth is produced but wanted to see it first hand. It was very fascinating seeing how they masserate the herbs and spices in the wine to impart the different flavours. Enjoyed the inevitable tasting at the end",
          "Seen it on TV and interesting to see for real. They make vermouth for others as well as themselves and \"cook\" their wine in the sun with a load of botanicals whilst periodically setting the sprinklers on the barrels. Mad but it clearly works!",
          "We did the cellar master tour and whilst the cellar master did not speak English a friendly we had a very nice translator who came with the tour. We also got tastings half way round and at the end with the end ones being In our own VIP room. Highly recommended and the amber",

          "Lovely staff who are so willing to please we joined a French tour but the young lady who was our guide was able to answer our questions in English. As soon as you get into the cellar the aroma was wonderful. The tour lasts for about half an hour and well worth the 4euro cost.",

          "OK full disclosure - I'm a bourbon fan and rarely indulge in martinis but the Noilly Pratt experience opened a whole new dimension to my beverage explorations. Our tour guide was unhurried, friendly and passionate about the NP offerings. And, after the tastings we snapped up 3",
          "We stayed in Marseillan for four days and ended with a tour if Noilly Prat. The first impression is the wonderful aroma, which changes as the tour progresses to different areas. The small enthusiastic team brought the whole place to life and the tasting at the end of the tour",

          "We enjoyed the tour and learned a lot about the Making of Noilly Prat. All very professional and well put together. The tasting was good too - tasting and comparing the three blends of Noilly Plat is something you can't do anywhere else. We purchased a bottle of the Amber",
          "It just takes an hour to do this tour and you will be told a lot about the history of a worldfamous product by a bilingual guide (some are even trilingual). Now you understand why James Bond was so fond of his cocktails! The tasting of the 3 different types of vermouth is",

          "Fun to have a look round at the big barrels and herbs & spices used, see the outside ageing and hear all about the angel's share - unfortunately, I'm just not a big fan of the drink itself so husband got the benefit of double helpings at the tasting!",
          "So James Bond is wrong; the perfect martini is (as well as being made with Noilly Prat) should be stirred not shaken. Just one nugget we picked up from an interesting and enjoyable tour of Chais Noilly Prat which ended with a tasting of the three different vermouths. The tour",

          "Really worth a visit, even if only for the free aperitif at the end see how a famous f-drink is made from oxidizes wine - a magic formula and many years of experience - the site of a field af barrels festering in the sunshine is worth it by itself",

          "Due to the torrential thunderstorms that were occurring on the day of our visit, we elected just to go to the observation deck rather than any of the other attractions. Although our view was stifled somewhat by the weather, for the 30RM ticket cost (and because we'd also",
          "We truly enjoyed our brief visit to the KL Tower for lunch during our day-long tour of Kuala Lumpur while cruising. The tower offers amazing views of this interesting, developing city. Our lunch was at the tower's rotating restaurant, and the food was great to go along with",
          "The Kuala Lumpur Tower [(KL Tower) or Menara Kuala Lumpur (in Malay)], in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is an important symbol in Kuala Lumpur, is the tallest tower in South-east Asia and the 7th tallest free-standing telecommunications tower in the world (opened in 1996), located on",
          "We got the observation deck tickets of the Menara KL tower as complimentary from the travel agent. The tower has 2 parts, sky deck is the level above and the observation deck is below. We checked with the counter there and an upgrade to skydeck would be an additional 50 RM, we",
          "The view from the top is just insane, and the experience in the skybox with glass bottom is a must do if you go there. If you visit Kuala Lumpur, I recommend this place",
          "I really enjoy the view from the top of Menara KL. The tower provides an excellent 360-degree view of the greater Kuala Lumpur area, with views of downtown KL's fascinating buildings, the city's balance between old and new areas, and the assorted green spaces tucked into all",
          "We had bought tickets on line and we went to KL tower. There were not a lot of people and we enjoyed the views. We went to the glass area had to take off our shoes and the photographer took pictures with his camera and also with ours. We enjoyed it very much. The grounds",
          "Was our first trip in KL and what a great start. Everywhere so clean, staff all very helpful and amazing views of the city",
          "Definitely can recommend if you look for a spectacular view of KL. There is also a small Aquarium there, which is small but funny to visit if you are interested in fishes not only on your plate ;)",
          "I went on sunset, which was perfect, because I had the best views before night fall and after, with the city lights. The top floor is outside, without roof to protect. Beware of inclement weather - the girl who sold me the ticket warned me of no refund due to bad weather, and I",
          "Somewhat overshadowed by the Twin Towers this viewpoint high above KL is actually higher than the platform on the Petronas towers and offers better cityscape views which include the Twin Towers. Well worth the MR49 or MR99 (depending on which observation platform you visit) fee.",
          "Menara or Petronas? I opted for Menara Tower. It may not be as tall as the Petronas Towers, but given that it's on a hill you're actually higher than the Petronas Towers once up there. I think I made the right decision but then I didn't do the other one to compare. The queue to",
          "I visited mid morning. No queue for a ticket and quite a short queue for the lifts, but quite slow moving. Probably took about 20 minutes. Once at the top you have a ticket which places you in a virtual queue to use one of the two sky boxes. On arrival the guide said about 15",
          "It was amazing view. For me, maybe better on kL tower than on twins. Glass boxes was new experience. You have 1:50 min to take a photo, but if you need you can ask more tickets for it. Also try coffee and ice cream on the top- in that area you can take more beautiful photos.",
          "A chance to stand in a glass box hanging over the side of a very tall tower, then allow someone to take pictures of you and then sell them to you. There are two boxes on the tower, you are allowed 1 minute and 40 seconds in the box. Then your turn is over. We were lucky as",
          "Another tv tower. What made this wonderful was the fact that we didn\u2019t have to wait at all... loved the views from top and bottom. So many photo opportunities. Food courts there too.",
          "1st time up to the top, bit hot in the middle of the day but if you prefer just go down to the next level in the air con and leave the outdoor scene for those that can handle it. I think it is good value for money. Keeps you amused for a couple of hours as well.",
          "On a clear day, you get a good 360\u00b0 view of the city together with the surrounding urban area for as far as your eye can see ...",
          "I stayed at MBF Menara and it is the heart of KL's CBD. Everything is around it, restaurants, pubs, premium offices, trains, etc.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, the view is breathtaking. You need to go early in the morning, otherwise you will have to wait for quite some time to take a photo in the skybox. Ask for the sky box with a view of the Petronas Towers. The cafe is expensive but a great place to enjoy",
          "The Menara Kuala Lumpur is a communications tower that also takes tourists up to the top for views of the city. It\u2019s not as crowded as Petronas, but the views are just as good and not as expensive. I\u2019ve done both the towers and I can honestly say that there\u2019s not much difference",
          "Great view on the top of observation deck .... buying the cheapest ticket should be good enough in taking the panoramic view. if you are afraid of height... you should not even attempt to go up but it is very safe and nice tower to view at night since it changes in so many",
          "great view of the city and if you're lucky to have no rain during the visit you can step into the skybox and take some amazing photos",
          "it is worth the money! the KL view is amazing. sky deck, skybox and observation deck in one price. You can see KLCC and there is beautiful mural on the sky deck so that you can take picture while waiting for your turn for skybox. The process to get a ticket is very smooth.",
          "We walked all the way up, long way and we didn't know that there was free shuttle from the gate! Ticket included Observation deck, sky box, aqvarium and zoo, so we spent here 4 hours! No queues, but 30 minutes wait to sky box (and i\u00b4m scared of heights!). K\u00e4velimme yl\u00f6s koko",

          "Reasonably priced to get to the observation deck and the view from there is worth it. Plenty of space to walk around and free usage of the binoculars.",
          "I went to this place with my family a few days before the Chinese New Year public holidays and had a terrible experience here. Paid 100 Ringgit per person to go up the tower and into the sky box. There was not much of a queue to go up the Tower and all seemed okay. When we",

          "Be sure to pay a little extra to go to the Skydeck while there. Great pictures from the glass box. Fun to look down the entire bottom under your feet. Note that the discount tickets offered from the travel guys only include the observation deck, which is fine, but the sky",
          "KL tower offers excellent views across the city. We went one afternoon, but the queues were long and we were advised that there was up to an hour's wait for the skybox. We returned the next day in the morning and went straight in. The package for the sky deck includes the",

          "We ate here on January 22nd. We had noticed a sharp drop in the reviews on the last week before we went and almost didn't go, BUT, we are so glad we did! We went for the 9pm dinner sitting. The buffet is huge with foods from all ethnicities represented in Malaysia. You simply",
          "Visited the KL tower and were surprised to find discounts for people over 60. The discounts included the observation deck and the glass box which is a bit leg wobbling but great views. We were also entitled to visit the mini zoo and blue coral which were a bit disappointing.",
          "I was amazed when I saw this KL Tower for first time in my life. The tower is 400+m which is the highest communication tower that I've ever seen. You'll see the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur on a 360\u00b0 view along top of this tower. The ticket is worth to avail even if ut's",
          "\u00a320 per adult to see panoramic view of smoggy city on open observation deck. Good for people, wanting selfies on glass floor box. Cant really get that excited.",
          "The Petronas Towers building may be taller than the KL Tower, but the observation deck at KL Tower is at a higher elevation, and still worth going to for a birds eye view of the sprawling city of Kuala Lumpur. We purchased tickets for the observation deck, the sky deck and",
          "Seems like this attraction is more commonly known as the KL tower rather than the menara. This is helpful if youre trying to book a taxi to it. Really impressive views, quite expensive (around 50 ringgit I think) and try to time your going up it for when it isn't very hazy...",
          "We were in KL a few days before New Years and the KL tower was packed. We took our confirmation email to the front desk and they tried to turn us away from the venue. When I told them this was our only day in KL, hence why we booked our tickets for this day, they relented and",
          "To visit the top most place of KL tower you need to pay 100 RM which seemed expensive to me in comparison to other tourist places of Malaysia. You will be able to get into Sky Box to take pictures for 1.40 minutes. Be sure to utilise your time. Better not to go alone. Theres a",
          "Rm180 for 3 photos at the skybox is a robbery!!! Very beautiful views and the skybox is amazing BUT they give you only 1 min 40 sec to have your pictures taken by a photographer + take pics yourself what is not enough time to even think of a pose to take a picture... I bought 7",
          "This is a great way to get a panoramic view of KL. If you get Observation deck tickets you have the added thrill of the two glass sky boxes. You only get a limited time in the sky box (less than 2 minutes I think), so you have to be quick if you are taking your own pictures.",
          "Best place in Kuala Lumpur to see the city from the sky. Possibly to go by free bus KLGO. Ticket cost 99 per adult for all decks plus glass cage. Absolutely must do it. Restaurant very expensive e. To go to take a picture into the glass cage you have to wait around 1 hour in the",
          "If you want to go and see Malaysia from the top then that\u2019s the place to go. Really recommend the glass box and the view from deck. Be aware that the line to the glass box is with tokens that get given once you reach a high floor with the view deck and the line might take a",
          "At first, I planned to visit here by bus, but I ended up going by online ride. When arriving, I just realised that my decision to hail online ride is correct. If you plan to go by free bus, you have to walk quite long and it's uphill on to reach the ticket counter. CMIIW if you",
          "We took the lift to the obervation deck and my partner was amazed at the view. She took numerous photos and i explained some of the sights. Had a clear day and could see all the way to the Genting Highlands.",
          "My friend and I tried to get same-day tickets to the Petronas Towers near our accomodation but we did not realise we should have booked tickets in advance of our travel to KL. So we ended up going to this tower instead. This turned out to be a good fortune for us because it was",
          "This tower is 421m high and a very scenic location. Most of the people are trying to go to the top of the tower to take pictures. But, there's a rush and you have to wait in the queue for a long time to buy a ticket. My opinion is not to go to the top but, still, you can",
          "The SkyBox deck is open-air whereas the Observation deck has glass and support structures obstructing views. The wait to ride the elevator up was 55 minutes. If you can walk a few steps between decks, then your wait can be a bit shorter. Upon reaching the SkyBox deck, you",
          "This tower alongwith the twin towers dominate the city skyline. The tower has several levels for shopping, food courts, entertainment for kids. A must place to visit.",
          "It's beauty is mesmerizing, and amazing. Try booking a high tea experience.or dinning experience at atmosphere 360. Will be worth it.",
          "We had been to the Menara 5 years ago and visited again. The place was unusually crowded on the new year eve and it took us sometime to reach the top. View is awesome with visiting.",
          "First time to KL tower I was hoping a great holiday But when I came, there are long queue on the lift to going up Please fix up the lift, when holiday season Then we queue agak to take photos in glass box, almost 1 hour just to take foto The nightmare came, there are another",
          "Located just opposite to Twin Towers. My suggestion is you can either visit the top of menara or twin tower. The point is from one building you can see the another tower. So, I wanted to see Twin towers, so I went to Menara tower top. Both have got tickets around 90 Malaysian",
          "We decided to do the KL Tower during the day and Twin Towers at night as both give 360 degree views of KL. There is only 25 meters difference in height between the 2 options of where you can get off. We just did the Observation Deck. Ticket price at the time of our visit was",
          "No that impressed, very disorganised system, Although we had pre booked tickets from UK we still had to wait 45minutes to get in because of the bad system by the lifts. Long queues and had to wait 3 hrs for sky deck . Instead of letting large number of people up they could",
          "SKY deck cost rm99. Second time here but they have this new queuing system to get into each sky box. You can't choose which sky box nor can you can get into both boxes! Best is to come morning to beat the long wait and lingering around under hot sun esp if you have children's.",
          "You get two ticketing options - The Observation Deck and the Skybox where the latter includes both. The Skybox facing the Petronas gives you wonderful views of the KL skyline and gives a more adventurous feel. People who have fear of heights might desist from going for the",
          "Must visit place in KL.One can eadily spend few hours with children at and around this Tower. December is probably a very busy time, there was along queue to enter here.",
          "We visited the tower some years back. We realized that they have now installed a pair of glass sky boxes at the top: not sure they work too well to be honest, as they make the walk around experience a tad clumsy. Still great views no doubt.",
          "From the top of this tower you can see 360% city of Kuala Lumpur. There are two observation venue open air that make big different with other obeservation place, another venue is indoor. The other unique thing that have a glass photo box, personally I went to this place because",
          "Very well managed and organized tour. We were particular about booking tickets for the Sky deck and the Sky box. However, we were worried about the rains in the month of December. As luck would have it, it kept raining the first day and we were unable to get to our Sky Box as",
          "If you going to menara towers,Make sure you go to the sky bridge. You will See you the aerial view of the Kuala Lumpur.",
          "Big no. Of visitors and long que to buy the tickets in unpair conditioned area. Tickets to Resturant not available and need to book before attending. Better to Pre- book tickets for everything in KL and plan your visits to avoid wasting time in long ques",
          "This is ok in the scheme of things. Signposting to get to it is horrendous though. We did this after Petronas so was a huge disappointment as view is inferior to Petronas towers.",
          "Visited the observation deck and the sky box. Great view of KL from the tower. Gives 360 degree view as you can walk around through observation deck. Lots of people around and prices are literally ripping people off just to see the view. Ok to have a single visit.",
          "Went up this to the observation deck. It's ruined by reflective glass, tacky shops and kids screaming. Pay the extra and go to the roof would be my advice. Views are excellent once you get used to the reflections",
          "Far better then twin tower. If you wanna go up and feel the city, this is a place to go. So do book your tickets online or buy them there itself and enjoy the deck view.",
          "Great experiences and view from KL tower sky deck and sky box. U will able to view KL city at 360 degree. Advised visit on weekdays to avoid crowd and long queue for photo session in sky box else suggest to visit observation deck",
          "This is one place every one should visit, did dinner here, fantastic views, food good, live music and piano player, staff friendly and very helpful",
          "Took some friends from Pakistan,views were excellent,admission tickets were rather costly I must admit,",
          "After navigating through the usual KL traffic, and finding a parking spot (I drove there!), then a visual treat awaits when you get to the top of the viewing level/s. A nearby park awaits those who wish for a bit of nature and light exercise, but make sure you have a couple of",
          "hi all, this is a must do thing. a very good view of the surrounding, plus sky cafe at the top is also great place to sit back and enjoy the view.",
          "The view from the Menara Tower was so spectacular and you can using the oscilloscope to observe other buildings. That was amazing",
          "Visiting the Menara was an overall good experience. There is also a sky box that has been recently installed - the waiting time to get s pic clicked in that can be as long as two hours!",
          "It's a scenic sight and almost visible from all parts of Kuala Lumpur. It's an important tourist spot. We have to take an entry tickets to visit observation deck. It's a tallest telecommunications tower in the world. We can have a great view of entire city from that deck.",
          "We were advised of an hour wait for the sky box it was nearly 3. Staff have no organisation skills at all. Views are good and biz is great. Just to long to wait!!!",
          "We did this at night since we planned on going up Petronas towers in the day so we could see the city from \"above\" both during the day and night. It is beautiful the way the city lights up! I ended up pre-booking tickets and had some issues with the format the tickets were",
          "From the top is the best place to see the whole city of kuala lumpur. Price is ok and worth of city views.",
          "Menara KL offers a more old-fashioned experience compared to that of the Petronas Towers. We had did the Petronas Towers the previous day and really enjoyed the experience and therefore were keen to try out the Menara Tower as well. We bought tickets on the Hop On Hop Off bus",
          "Not as complete an experience as the Petronas Tower, nor as slick. But worth the visit for the 360 degree view of the city.",
          "I have visited the tower a few times but never went into the glass box , amamzing addition to the tower , not for people who scared of heights",
          "Advice: Book tickets online and book a few days in advance of when you want to go as this gets VERY busy. If you like panoramic views then this is for you, if you're brave enough do the skybox and have a pic taken on your phone or camera. If you're not brave enough then the gift",
          "Something that you need to experience to have a good view of the city. Only setback is that the waiting time is quite long and very pricy",
          "- I love this view compared to the Twin Tower specially when you can take some amazing pictures form the top observatory tower (Not the covered one). - Food is not that great but with the lunch/dinner ticket but it worth for the revolving restaurant. - The service level is",
          "So, it\u2019s100 ringots to get to the top, you have to wait in a queue on the bottom floor for 40 minutes. Once you get up there\u2019s a 360 view of the city but there is also a cafe that charges 35 ringot for even an espresso. Staff are very pushy and there are time limits on how long",
          "The Kuala Lumpur Tower is a communications tower located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Its construction was completed on 1 March 1995. It features an antenna that increases its height to 421 metres and is the 7th tallest freestanding tower in the world.",
          "Otherwise known as the KL tower this is smaller than the petronas towers but the view is great. If we had to choose between seeing the petronas towers or the KL tower I think we would choose the petronas but while there we think you should see as much as you can.",
          "Drove by the tower with open deck bus. It is a big tower, but nothing you couldn't see in Berlin, Rotterdam or wherever.",
          "A free shuttle minivan runs up and down to the tower every 15 minutes. Located in the same area is a mini zoo, aquarium and the upside down house. As we made our way up the clouds and rain moved in. Views were still exceptional though, also located here is a revolving restaurant",
          "You can go here to enjoy the beauty of Kuala Lumpur city. Now it is easy to shoot from the ceiling. The entry fee is very high. This should be reconsidered. Reducing fees will bring more people to visit.",
          "Visiting observation deck is subject to weather permitting. Glass panel at Box is hot, as you are required to remove shoes. Queue for lifts, queue for Box photo-taking is time-consuming\u2014should have better management on that. And the ice-cream at the cafe is damn expensive.",
          "revisited after years with friends fro overseas, not recommended at all. Air quality was bad, only 1 service lift was working (to the top floor). Waiting time for the glass deck was about 1 hour although it\u2019s less crowded today. So spent time in the only cafe. Coffee machine",
          "Paid lots for the sky deck and glass thingi, but really not worth it. It's a long wait to get into the glass thingi, and you are there for few minutes. Just do the observation deck if you really want to.",
          "On my opinion it\u2019s a better view than Twin Towers because you can see them. We bought a combo package which included Sky Box, Sky Observation Deck, Mini Zoo, Aquarium & Upside Down House.",
          "We went on a weekday hoping it wouldn't be too busy but it was insane. Getting up to the observation deck was quick, but getting back down was painful, there's no real system & people were trying to do the right thing and line up only to have people pushing through and getting",
          "Lovely old style design, Lovely grounds, and the area around, Nice restaurants, Around many local sights and sounds, Great stop on the hop on hop off bus",
          "Great area to spend a few hours. Did the tower to top outside level, which also has the glass enclosure hanging off the building for photos. Also great as you can do some souvenirs shopping, as well as visit the mini zoo, aquarium and upside down house. Great for all ages to",
          "This gleaming tower is visiable from all Kuala Lampur are~viewing deck is, at 276 meters, at least 100 meters higher than the Petronas Twin Towers\u2019 Skybridge; the view is marvellous during the day~ at night when you can see the entire sparkling city centre~ at night dazzling",
          "We have taken Sky Deck as well with our little one. It is a must visit place and worth money spending on this. Would always suggest to take Zoo as well in combo. Here are the some drawbacks about this site visit. Drawbacks: 1. Long queue to get in 2. Takes time to get your",
          "This tower has some decent views, but it really depends on the weather of the day. We went when there was alot of smog and visibility wasn't great. You can see the twin towers from here, although it's not the best angle, so if you want to get good snaps of the towers from high",
          "My friends and I went to the KL tower to view the observation tower and skybox. Unfortunately, it rained and we were told to wait out for the rain to stop, so we can make our way up to the skybox. After waiting for 2 hours, the skybox was closed for the day. Only an apology was",
          "Managed to get the ticket via online.The ticket is open ticket. Straight forward tour.... Friendly staff Regards, Din",
          "We booked the high tea package for two.There is discount for senior citizen above sixty years old.The panaromic view of KL from this revolving restaurant was spectacular.But the choice of foods was rather limited.",
          "Brilliant views over the city and the glass box was cool. The weekend we visited there was base jumping happening which was cool to see. The queue system was a bit crazy, not a lot of signage to show you what's going on.",
          "I guess if you're on a budget and the Petrona's one is quite expensive then this is a good alternative. It's just ok, the view, the experience.. it just ok.. Best to bring your funnest friend to make this tour more exciting.",
          "We visited here as part of a half day tour.We enjoyed the views of the city with a 360 degree view. A few more things near by to do if you go there only. But recommended doing it as part of a tour.",
          "I do not recommend this to anyone, unless you want to pay too much for just nothing and get exhausted at the end. Paid for 3 different view points via advanced online booking. And it doesnt matter actually. You have to wait on the queue anyway, with others who bought ticket at",
          "We could go only to the first observation deck as due to rains the skywalk was not allowed..still amazed at the view the OD throws up. This is at a height of 200mt. The petronas towers , the new upcoming PNB118 and the now tallest exchange 106...all the 3 skyscrapers are quite",
          "Had a visit to kl tower and it was a little disappointing. It is very expensive if you want all 3 experiences. The observation deck has limited views. The sky deck is even worse. One amount of people in a tiny space that you can barely walk. The sky box is a joke. Had to wait",
          "We got tickets to the sky box which is the top floor visitors can go and the view is amazing but the thing is that there are photographers who want us to purchase pictures taken by them if you are interested and the time you get to spend in both the sky boxes are 1 min and 40",
          "One the Best Attraction in KUL, highly recommended to have visit this place in Day Light and get the Best View of KUL",
          "Watching Kuala Lumpur from the Menara Sky Deck is a treat to the eyes.. A must visit destination in KL.",
          "Excellent way to enjoy the KL skyline while being presented with a fairly good buffet spread. Only downside are the long queue up and if the sky is too cloudy (or hazy as in our case!). Kids loved the experience.",

          "I was quite unlucky went up there on the period where the Indonesia fire smoke block all the view but luckily only booked for the observation deck instead of the very top with more price. The day before was a bit better but since we booked online for the last event before we",
          "It is one vantage point to see the city but there are two decks: one enclosed, the other open which has a more expensive entrance. A restaurant is also available but the prices are steep. There\u2019s just too many people at the time we went up and could not really get an excellent",
          "The revolving restaurant offers great views of Kuala Lumpur both day and night time. Great choice of foods in buffet and it is continuously refilled so it does not matter what time you start to eat.",
          "It's a great view of the city .. BUT .... Any sort of bad weather and it can be closed for a long time, so check before arriving. The view of the Petronas Towers isn't great as its at right-angles, so you only see 1 tower. the glass ledge is limited to '2 minutes' which is again",
          "Amazing views from the restaurant 360 atmosphere. Book a table and you don\u2019t have to pay to get in. \u00a323 a full buffet which was pretty good. Stunning views and great photo opportunity\u2019s",

          "The KL Tower is a nice place to take yourself and family to visit. On the ground floor, theres not much, except food and drink, and kiosk to book your ticket to go up to the top of the tower. If you pick a nice clear evening, go up to the top into the revolving tower and take in",
          "It was nice to be able to see Kuala Lumpur from above but, the prices were quite high of 99 MYR ($23) even though it included sky box, observation deck, and sky deck. Sky desk was really nice because there wasn't so much glass in the way and you were able to see KL clearly,",
          "First thing - if you decide to walk to the tower it is a steep uphill walk which means you will get very hot and VERY sweaty. Prebooked on Klook so got quite a good deal. Unlike other reviewers there were no queues so got to viewing decks quite quickly. They are fine - as per my",

          "Wow what a joke this place is, booked on klook for 2 people and cost \u00a310 ..... only cheap but It would be more fun to buy dog food and eat it. Cues are a joke to go the top and when you finally get there it\u2019s such. Disappointment. Horrible dirty glass windows all the way around,",
          "Visited the KL Towers one afternoon in September, 2019....great view of the city. Like other towers in other cities like Seattle, The Space Needle, Toronto, The CNN Tower and the one in Macau... they basically have the same feature but one thing different was the view.",
          "Opted to do Menara instead of KKL because off price & I feel better view... We went in May so weather was great and beautiful clear view of the city. Sky Box unreal experience abit frightening when you first step out but well worth it. Had coffee & cake at the cafe on the",
          "Yes the lines were long to the skybox but totally worth it. It did start raining and it was a bit cloudy but I still feel it was worth it. You can\u2019t control Mother Nature so make the best of it and I did. They only closed once the first bolt of lightning struck I was fortunate",
          "To escape a hot day in the city, we decided to pay to go to the observation deck. We thought it was expensive, but figured that there was bound to be a cafe or bar up the where we could buy a drink and enjoy the views. There was not. Every 2 minutes someone was trying to",
          "Opted to go up at 5.30pm which gave us time to see the city during good daylight - then went for expensive drinks in the cafe, waited for the allotted sky box time (not really worth the wait) and before we knew it the sun was going down so we hung around till dark. Glad we did.",
          "We wanted to visit here for the sunset but missed it....the queue time was EPIC! despite having already bought tickets we queued for almost an hour, no air conditioning and were boiling hot and fed up by the time we got up there. If you want to see the sunset get there super",

          "I did not have a great view because of Haze. Sky box is over exaggerated and is not worth as one does not get enough time to experience it. Allotted time in sky box is approximately 30 seconds which goes in clicking pictures and then you will be asked to leave. Sky box main",
          "Although better value and less queue time than the Petronas Towers, I still don\u2019t feel that this was great value for money. We queued for 45 mins or so for the Sky Deck; the lift whisked us up and deposited us 300 metres up in no time. We could have walked up the 1800 odd stairs",
          "This was a good thing to do to get some great photos. However, I think the organisation for getting into the skybox left quite a bit to be desired. The queue for it was 2 hours however, nothing was mentioned about the waiting times and it was just everyone sitting around on the",
          "We enjoyed picking out places visited from up there. It was my friends birthday and we had the buffet meal in the 360o restaurant. What wonderful food and views, recommend this to everyone",
          "We booked the Sky Deck option however there was only a small amount of drizzle (not even rain) so the entire Sky Deck was closed. Also the visibility was low due to smog, fog, smoke so not really worth it.",
          "We went to the observation deck and the view was not so great as expected. Really wasted time and money for taxi and ticket.",
          "This is a great way to see the city from above. It was great place to take pictures. We grabbed some souvenirs and went to the bottom level and grabbed lunch. The pizza place was great. A must do!",
          "We went here on a Saturday, from the minute we arrived until we left there were hordes of people here. Despite the crowds the staff seemed to move people up and down the tower (via the elevator and in some cases the stairway) in an extremely slow inefficient way. Usually when",
          "We were there over the weekend on Hari Raya Haji and the crowd was very large. The queue at the elevator up and down were both long and not so well managed to cope. Therefore the experince was quite disasterious. Suggestion on visits during non holiday period will be justified.",
          "Eventhough the view is amazing, you are not informed of long waiting line for the sky box in the entrance/ticket hall. Visitors should be informed of the waiting line up on the deck before they purchase tickets and go up. This is so out of manners for me as a tourist from",
          "This is a great way to see the cityscape. It\u2019s quite pricey but you get an amazing view from above. There are good free binoculars to see even better!",
          "It was much faster standing in the queue for the observation deck than for the sky deck. It is inside and so not that hot than outside.",
          "The views from the tower are nice and it\u2019s cool to see the petronas towers, but it definitely wasn\u2019t worth the wait of 1.5 hours to get up in the sweltering lobby plus a bonus wait of half an hour to get down again.",
          "So we paid for entering the skybox and when we went up the guy told us that we won\u2019t enter because there is not enough time and said you can ho downstairs and solve this with them. Howe er if we would have done that we would have kissed the whole ticket because we should have",
          "The view was to die for and the ambiance was definitely great. Service was point on but the food (taste and selection) was not impressive hence two stars off.",
          "A lot of waiting to go up in the lift to the top and a long wait for the skybox which we gave up on! The aquarium was small but the owner really knowledgeable and enthusiastic and it\u2019s very cool and refreshing inside.",
          "Must go to sky box if you visit here. Nothing much to see. I would love to see such an iconic tourist spot maintained & operated better.",
          "There are two main options to go up: level 3 (indoor) and level 5 (outdoor). We chose level 5 (300m high). If you want to avoid the long queue to level 5 (above 30min), you can go to level 3 (usually the shortest queue) and walk the stairs; it is allowed and a really short",
          "I purchased ticket for RM99.00 was good I went to 3 stops there was a guide brought us. They also have a restaurant at the top it's great slightly expensive 360 degrees rotating restaurant.",
          "The glass box worth the experience. Also the full ticket with the small zoo and the rest of the museums.",
          "Better than going to Petronas twin towers. The Obeservation deck gives you a 360 degree view of the city whereas with Petronas one is only able to access the bridge and you only get a view from the front and back because the towers are blocking your view on either side. So if I",
          "A bit disappointing! I definitely expected more!! The sky box was awesome but the disappointing bit is that your visit in the sky box is timed. So there is hardly time to take some photos with your family. Photos are a rip off, dont buy unless you have money to throw away. I",
          "We paid the equivalent of about $50 US for the pair of us to go to the observation deck, which I thought was quite expensive for what you get. We waited in line for at least 30 minutes to go to the top. Once there we were given a ticket for Sky Box 2, which is one of the glass",
          "My wife and I took our daughter, her husband and their 8-year old twins to lunch at the revolving restaurant atop the KL Tower. The kids, visiting us from London with their parents, had the time of their life. Circular ambulation on the observation deck before and after lunch,",
          "Great views and glass box 1 amazing and great views of personas towers. Cafe at top of you need refreshment. Would recommend you also stop at observation deck to get extra photos from different angle",
          "It's very nice trip to KL tower and worthy of this visit. We were enjoyed in Sky deck and observation deck visit. But it should maintain in more to attract the visitors.",
          "I don't know if deserves the payment (deck 45 DM skyline 99 DM). Nice views, 10 minutes max, 20 minutes waiting. Maybe as a family plan with children. - they try to sell you everything, photo, souvenirs, ... they don't let you enjoy freely the space. Grade: 4 (1 to 10)",
          "Good to go up but if you\u2019re expecting great views of the Petronas Towers, look elsewhere. The problem is that it\u2019s in line with the axis of the twin towers, meaning you can only see one of them. Quite expensive too, all things considered.",
          "First time @ Menara KL and the view is amazing. A must see when you are in KL. Long wait for the sky box but its memorable.",
          "The views are nice, but the hassle of getting there and then queuing forever to get up and climb down is just not worth it! There are only two working elevators, one was out of order so it took more than an hour to leave the tower! The staff were not helpful at all and most",
          "Great views around KL, and a very impressive structure, but it is fairly expensive for what it is, and Id probably recommend visiting the Petronas towers if you only visit one. Quite a lot of tourist hoopla both inside and out can be annoying.",
          "As I discovered from this website, this place was one of the most highly rated places, and knew it had to be on my list once I got to KL. So I went on the first full day of my trip and hiked up the steep hill (and which made for a great cardio workout haha). Once reaching the",
          "I love the view in Kuala Lumpur, beautiful, worth the ticket. Make sure no raining day, else you can only stay inside",
          "If you are in town for a short visit you should visit this place. Yes it\u2019s a tourist trap with all its downfalls but it comes with an incredibly nice view. We could even find out Hotell..:) The \u201csky glass box\u201d is something you should do if you aren\u2019t faint hearted. We payed",
          "We visited KL tower as a family. It was great! We bought the sky deck and sky box tickets and I recommend that you do so! When we got to the top of the sky deck we were given numbers. These numbers are your ticket to the sky box. They have a professional photographer to take",
          "Firstly I recommend getting transport up to the tower, I walked up in 35 degree heat, that wasn\u2019t the best idea as it\u2019s very steep. Once you get to the reception area you need to buy a ticket for either the observation deck or/and the sky deck. Observation ticket is about 50",
          "Having been to Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay sands, Malacca\u2019s Menara tower and Penang\u2019s Komtar tower, I would only rate this as average. The view is great but they haven\u2019t maintained it as well. The open area on the top deck is quite small, no seats unless you go into the tiny drinks",
          "Totally recommend KL Tower and to go to the open observation deck. View was amazing and I got there around 930am and went straight up and out. Sky box is free from there and we\u2019ll worth the look unless you\u2019re afraid of heights.. Had no problem with the online booking and",
          "This communication tower is famous for the view from here. We visited during afternoon just before dusk. We visited the observation deck from for a view of the city and the magnificent twin towers.",
          "It is special because of 2 thinks: the 360 panorama that you don't have it in many other places in other buildings from KL. Also the glass box is very nice but it can be a big queue to wait for it. They have 2 glass boxes and a ticketing allocation system that helps to know when",
          "the 421m telecommunication tower is mind glowingly tall. the skybridge walk on it at the top is worth every penny only if you are not scared of heights as it has a see through floor so you feel like you are stepping on glass . everyone is soft footed and you do have to take",
          "Tried hard to get there early and avoid the queues, but didn't get there until 10am. But, there wasn't a queue. Head up the escalator and buy a ticket from the machine - staff are on hand and are very willing to help. We did the sky deck, with the glass cubes. This was great.",
          "We arrived just after 9am at the entry after walking up the hill from the street. Worked off breakfast doing that, steep climb with lots of stairs. Recommend taking a taxi or a shuttle if you have sore knees (didn\u2019t see the shuttle bus mentioned by other reviews) Bought our",
          "It was very long queue to the cubicles (more than 1 hour of waiting!). Very long time of waiting elevators as well. Overpriced.",
          "Think it was a waste of time when i brought my oversea guests last week. service was so-so and nothing impressive. We wanted to have coffee at the restaurant and was told that we need to purchase the tickets only able to do so. very troublesome. will not go again.",
          "The lights from the tower at night are fantastic, they keep changing colour and the Hop On Hop Off bus stops at the Tower.",

          "The view from the sky deck is magnificent, but it is overcrowded and we had to wait for the sky box for over 90 mins to find out that 3 professional photos are RM 190 (about 40$...)",
          "It's better to get up on this tower, instead of the Petronas Tower. They offer two different tickets. I suggest you to take the more expensive one. The view is definately worth the extra cost.",
          "Fantastic views from the top, probably better than the Twin Towers. Can skip the indoor observatory if you're already good to the open deck.",
          "I did both Petronas Towers and the KL Tower and found KL Tower to be much better value. You can spend as long as you want on the observation deck and you also can sit in a glass box on the side of the building - not for the faint-hearted! Although they take official photos they",
          "like it says, not totally worth the money ... they should offer some more attractions. Perhaps some souvenir shops",
          "KL Tower is a place not to be missed for tourists. Entry is 45 ringitts to the Hall but you have to pay extra for the observation deck which is not accessible in bad weather. Nevertheless, you still enjoy a good view from the top. There are a good number of restaurants and",
          "Staff helpful. Sky box a little unnerving, but worth doing. Don't go too early if you want F1 souvenirs at the shop as it doesn't open till 3.30pm. More here than at the Patronas, which is a little surprising.",
          "Boring, like every city they have a observation tower, 48rm , so much to see as its a developing country you can see the Petronas tower side ways. Not worth it and pointless should be free tbh",

          "I always wanted to see Kuala Lumpur from up above especially in the night. That is the reason we visited the KL tower on the last day of our trip. As we had flight in the evening, we visited the tower in the day time and that was on a weekday. So crowd was comparatively less.",
          "This visit is aimed at travellers arriving by car or tour buses. We were on foot and spotted at the bottom of the steep hill \"FREE SHUTTLE BUS every 15 minutes\". We waited 30 minutes for it to arrive. The driver was the rudest we have met of anyone involved in tourism industry.",
          "Sky deck ticket includes the observation deck, but if you are on a budget but want to experience this tower go for the observation deck, The view is great in the sky deck and please don't miss to have picture in the glass box. Let the photographer take a lot of photos of you",
          "I absolutely loved my visit to KL tower. Luckily when I visited there were no queues to access was very quick. There a places to eat and drink at the base of the tower and many other additional activities to add in to the visit if you want. The observation decks are great and",
          "A poor experience with very long, unmanaged queues, lethargic and uninterested staff. Once you finally get up to the viewing levels they give you time to enjoy the views but for us it was a bit of an anti climax after all the queuing. They need to rethink their organisation and",
          "We went to the observation deck and the sky deck, I would definitely recommend going up to the sky deck as the views there are amazing. We had to wait quite a while to get into the sky box, where you have about 3 minutes on a clear walkway (perfect views of the city below) to",

          "We made the trek to the base but did not get to the Sky Deck this time. For those who are scared of heights, this tower will challenge you. The free shuttle from the entrance to the tower office is a nice touch. The mini zoo looks sad for the poor animals.",
          "Kuala Lumpur Tower is a place that you must visit. The vuew from the top just beautiful. Make sure you buy ticket for the top deck and observation area. And dont forget to take a photo at jewel box. Please be aware that take photo at jewel box will be an extra fee. So if you",

          "Make sure you book the full attraction that includes the Skybox and the Sky deck. Just visitng the Observation deck is the same as visiting the Petronas Tower. The sky box makes this truly an amazing experience and beats the Petronas tower views. We arrived at 09:30 in the",

          "We went noontime. Everything was perfect but talking with staff was not helpful as no English language with security. Staff with paid services was great but again it's PRETTY PAID services for. Try go in morning to avoid traffic jam afternoon. We spent 4 hours going back unless",
          "Went here as it was in our list of places to visit. 49 RM to the observation deck which is roughly \u00a39. Double that to go up a few metres more to the Sky Deck. The prices are a bit high for basically wandering around for a few minutes enjoying the 360 degree panoramic views. I am",
          "A good night out with a great meal. The views from the rotating resturant are wonderful. The Buffet meal was the highlight of our stay and well worth the cost",
          "Definitely take a trip to the highest skydeck in KLCC! The unobstructed 360\u00b0 views are to die for. We went her before we hit up the Petronas Towers!!!",
          "The view was amazing, the photographers took such amazing photos on the deck. Thestaff was friendly and the pizza place is a MUST. a definite must see in Kuala Lumpur. Will definitely go again.",
          "First stop on cruise organised trip. No idea how much the trip was. We went to first deck which had amazing views across the city. Quite interesting to see the different towers around the world. Had we more time would have liked to have gone up a level and seen the Skybox. Well",
          "The entry to the top is little expensive and time consuming but the view from the top is breathtaking . Especially on transparent decks.worth a try once.",
          "Multi-function tower in the city center and is another iconic landmark. Plenty of photo opportunities here.",
          "Perfect spots for perfect views of KL. Moreover, it is the only place where there are two glass boxes leaning outside the tower that are totally worthy (even though there are usually long lines, it\u2019s included in the admission ticket). I am giving it 4 star though cause prices",
          "After dinner at the tower we went up to the observation deck to absorb the views, and wow. well worth it.",
          "Luckily, we got great weather to enjoy the views from the Observation Deck and Sky Box up in the Menara Tower. Spend those extra bucks and do the boxes: there are two, one on one side and another on the other side of the tower. And be brave!",
          "An iconic building in Kuala Lumpur so on our must do list ! We did the eco walk and upside down world first and it was a super hot day so make sure you have water !!! Good to do but petronas tower was more impressive overall",
          "Not many must see in the city, Menara is one of few. A nice view from above, glass box is really nice and city looks spectacular. One thing I didnt get, why some people according to their nationality were able to bypass the long waiting line, but I guess it's fine.",
          "99rm for sky box. I was told 45mins to 1 hour wait. It was 2 hours. Quite a few people give up. Make sure you get a number for the sky boxes! When you get to the top they scan your ticket but don\u2019t tell you that you need another ticket to get on the wait with a 4 digit number.",
          "I was suprised how small the floor with the glass boxes was. Qued up for the glass box and then was told you need to collect a ticket so as soon as you go through the barriers to your right make a u turn to your left and ask the assisant for a slot on the glass box. You have an",
          "Fine dining in the revolving restaurant is a must do! In one hour and 15 mins you would have completed a full 360 degrees revolution. Compare tall buildings of the world in the observatory deck. Close by the twin towers, you can add to your travel package the zoo negara",
          "Way to face your acrophobia. For those who afraid of height, do come visit at night and make sure you choose the right box \ud83d\ude09",
          "The tower itself is amazing , you can see the while city , the restaurant is serving a very good food , and it is moving so you have various view of the city A very nice place to visit",
          "The view is so amazing , the sky box is worth it, but prepare to be rushed and talked at rudely by workers. It's also very crowded and not a nice atmosphere. Workers will push you to take pics and try sell it to you for 75$, taking advantage of unaware or old tourists who can't",
          "This place is a must to go at night..we had our dinner at 360 atmosphere..perfect buffet dinner with perfect ambience and view! Loved this place to the max!! Perfect place for a romantic dinner and proposal(HINT)...",
          "Well worth the trip to see KL from a good height. Amazing the distance on a clear day , with lots of information . Good for kids aswell. Lift up is fine and comfortable. I'd say one of my favourite places visited in KL , just to see the size of the place",
          "Breathtaking views of the city at night. Queues were short and the staff was friendly and professional.",
          "A 1300ft tower and we nearly did miss it! Locally it's known as the KL Tower. We booked a taxi to the Menara and ended up in a shopping mall with that name. Check out what your taxi driver calls it! We prebooked discount tickets to the viewing gallery and the Sky Box. That's",
          "The top of the KL Tower (that\u2019s the way they call it) is a must try. Do not book in advance, wait for a good weather, go by taxi and at about 17:00: you will not queue too much and enjoy the sunset and night lights. Sky deck and sky box ate with the same ticket. Once at the",
          "The place is visible from distance all over the city and one of the best attraction after petronas towers. Has a 360 degree view of city. Attraction on top is the view box that let's you stand on glass floor giving a feeling of floating in air. Great place for photography.",
          "Very long queue; but worth the wait if you have the patience to do so; the view from the top is magnificent.",
          "My friend and I use monorail station, dropping by at Raja Chulan and start walking toward the Towers. On arrival, we purchase the ticket via kiosk machine and then have to queue up. You have to come early because the queue is too long. However after a hour queue we manage to go",
          "We went to Menara Towers in the morning and bought a combo package which included Sky Box, Sky Observation Deck, Aquarium, Upside Down House & Mini Zoo. It was well organised paid by the computerised ticket machine and guide that help you purchase your ticket. The Sky Box has",
          "The view is nice and we took beautiful pictures. There is no many towers around the would and this one is one of them dois valuable to visit. There is 2 tickets and the best one is to go to glass box but there are 2 and the line 2 weeks ago to go to the box 1 in front of the",
          "The way to KL Tower is confusing from the nearest MRT station. Went to the LRT station Bukun Nasa and the long way up to the tower. When arriving, I was rushed to a self- ticketing maschine. The staff choosean option for the sky deck and skybox at 99 MYR. Check your ticket",
          "Our driver took us to the hotel parking pushing us to buy tickets there, saying there would be a 1h queue at the entrance. Don\u2019t believe. There are a few automates where you can easily buy a ticket. Staff is very helpful. Cafe bar on the top: Coconuts on the top cost 25 myr",
          "I visited the KL tower based on recommendations from different travel sites compared to visiting the Petronas Towers. The views are amazing the cost to access is $100MYR to access both floors to view the city. When you get to the entrance theres a shuttle to take you to the",
          "A must visit for tourist . Provides 360 Views to the city . Must take complete Package which includes glass deck",
          "Had a chance to visit KL tower. It was fun. Bought the package ticket for entrance to the observatory plus trying the glass box plus seeing the aquarium. You can change the aquarium with the zoo, or 3D cinema. It was raining but then we finally made up to the top, trying the",
          "One of the best experiences so far in KL. We took the skybox option And the sky-deck . There are two glass boxes actually , you have enough time to take photos .",
          "Improved information at the bottom about the different levels would be helpful. As soon as we arrived got off the escalator we were hustled to the machines and rushed into booking a ticket, any ticket without really understanding the options( sky deck and observation deck).",
          "There is a higher charge for the Sky Deck and Sky Box but much better than the enclosed Observation Deck. On the late afternoon when I visited rain started to come in and they had to close the Sky Deck, but stamped my ticket for a return the following day. The weather then was",
          "The place was great until we reached the skybox. The operating staff and the photographer started laughing and joking when I asked him a question. I politely told the photographer we didn\u2019t want our pictures taken, we would be taking our own pictures using our phone. The staff",
          "Well the tower won. 99 MYR to go to the Sky Deck and Sky Box and 49 MYR just to the observation deck. The difference being the Deck is outside and you are allowed to go, barefoot, into the glass box, which overhangs the towers extremities. Those with a mild fear of heights, stay",
          "Yes, the views are amazing but the staff appeared more interested in selling you the photo you are obliged to have taken when you reach the top. Tacky gifts piled all around the viewing area and disinterested staff on mobile phones. Recommend the Petronus Towers if you want",
          "One of the tallest telecommunication tower in Malaysia and also Asia. The lift to bring the visitors to the top view of the tower are fast and view from the top is very nice and can see the whole Kuala Lumpur city and some of other city area. Located in the middle of the city",
          "Beautiful view from up there 360 over the city and surrounding mountains. However outdated facilities and not very friendly staff",
          "Got to Menara KL through the KL hop-on hop-off bus. Since the 4 of us were not carrying enough cash and no cards on that day we gave up the skybox experience and went to the observation deck instead. Before getting on the elevator professional pictures were taken. The ride up",
          "I was in a honeymoon trip, this was one of options in mind, I reserved ahead of time for a window table, which is more expensive, I can say I expected to be welcomed with a wider smile maybe because it\u2019s super expensive, however, the guy who took us to our table tried to give us",
          "I love the highest view on the city. I always pay a combo in the revolving restaurant buffet instead of only going up. You can have a great dinner with the most spectacular view on the night lights. It s almost like you could touch the shards of Petronas. Don't miss to book the",
          "I figured getting there as close to opening time would give me the best of all worlds - shorter lines, more time on the \u201cbox\u201d and of course fewer people. My calculation proved right. There was not a single person in line and we got a lot more time in the Sky Box. There is a",
          "I enjoyed a few hours up there. The most memorable part was walking out onto the overhang with the glass floor. Terrifying. Exhilarating. I'd recommend getting the more expensive ticket that allows you to go to the outside observation area. As long as you've made the trip,",
          "this Tower offers fantastic views of the Kuala Lumpur and is the place to visit while in town, not to be missed",
          "We had awesome experience at the sky deck .We could click lots of pictures , as there was excellent view . Even the stairs are nice .",
          "We had good weather and a clear view of KL and the surrounding area. Various tower levels are available but we opted to visit the observation deck at 276m. Windows give a clear view of the city skyline. A glass box at 300m called the sky box is also available. as well as the sky",
          "We took the option for the skybox (I think that\u2019s what it was called) and it is worth the extra cost. The photographers were good and will take pictures on your device. They do look a little bored so try and engage with them and I\u2019m sure they will take some great shots.",
          "On a beautiful bright morning we visited Menara towers. We came quite early just after they had opened, so it was not too busy yet. First we did the sky deck, which is an open air deck with views all around. It's a lovely sight, I would suggest bringing sunglasses as it was",
          "Went here whilst in KL, it's a bit on the expensive side, but worth it. We got there about 10am and it was nice and quiet but when we left about 12 the queues were massive.",
          "This was my second visit to the KL Tower & again I was not disappointed. It wasn't busy (I have never seen it busy) & you are free to wander around at your leisure. I recommend the Sky Deck, which is outside at the top, with two glass boxes with great photo opportunities. There",
          "Everyone must pay a visit to KL Tower, not only tourist but Malaysian as well. You can see the view of KL at day and night. Check it out yourself and you will not regret.",
          "We were on the observation deck and enjoyed the panorama view of the KL skyline. Spellbinding impression, we could stay for hours.",
          "nice view of the city from here. the sky box is amazing. it gives you a view of the whole area and just dare look down while standing on the glass platform !",
          "Had an awesome visit.. Beautiful sceneries. All the members were really liked it.. Hope to visit again.",
          "KL is very proud of its towers, and although this may not be a famous as the Patronas Towers, this is is easier to visit. There is a fee, and you will wait to line to take the elevator up. Once you are at the viewing area, you can take your time looking over KL and at the",
          "It is a nice 360 view at the top which you will get from your hotel also but the place is not only for KL tower. You have plenty of attraction near. Upside down home, Aquarium, and the animal park where you can touch , feel and feed the animals are the best. You can have a sky",
          "Had an excellent visit with lovely views of the city, the eco park is also worth a visit with monkeys roaming the place. The side attractions such as the aquarium I wouldn\u2019t bother with",
          "The trip to the top provided a great view of the city, there were some interesting displays that were at the top. When I was there it wasn\u2019t crowded.",
          "This was part of our tour and we had lunch here as well, for what we paid for the whole day it was worth it all be it a little rush, the lunch we nice alot of fresh local food which we loved, and great views from the revolving resturant",
          "This was worth the waiting. The skyroom is a great experience and fun. Pity the is no information on what you looking at up at that level. Observation deck has all information. Had to wait for the sky box because of school children. Friends arrived later had no waiting. Staff",
          "This tower and the views was amazing ! We had a 15\u2019min que but once we was in it was pretty quick moving . Fab through and through and there is also the glass view box in which you have 3 mins per customer for pics and after that your times up which is fine as others need to use",
          "Typical tall tower with beautiful city view. Worth the price of admission. At the top are two glass bottom photo areas that you queue for. Plan to visit for about an hour most of it waiting in line. Still enjoyed the view though.",
          "The iconic KL Tower located in center part of Kuala Lumpur and a must visit attraction in Kuala Lumpur. You have to buy a ticket to go to observation desk. The view from above was amazing. There are two glass boxes at observation desk (top one) having glass floor s so. The entry",
          "I think that the KL tower is worth the visit. We walked all the way up from the parking lot to the entrance and it was totally doable. The tickets are a bit overpriced, 99MYR for the outside deck. At the sky deck it gives you the opportunity to stand in the 'glass box' which is",
          "Pay the extra and go to the sky deck, on the way down you stop at the observation deck. The photos are outrageously expensive at MYR 180 Just ask the photographer to use your camera. Seniors get a discount so take a copy of your Id,",
          "Plan your trip here carefully, if you have a lovely clear day you will get the most from this trip. We went on a Saturday so it was very busy. We did both decks and the views are fabulous. So many great buildings to see and enjoy. If you are feeling brave do the photos in the",
          "Went to the skydeck (99 MYR) , absolutely worth. So much better than Marina Bay Sands as well! I went around 6 pm so the temperature was perfect and I could witness sunset also. I stayed until 8 and it was breathtaking. You can walk around the Skydeck to find some shade. My",
          "We had a lovely evening seeing the sun set over Kuala Lumpur. The food is OK, there is a lot of choice in a buffet setting. Worth the visit just to see the skyline at night.",
          "Great tower, it revolves, we had a buffet here once, and theres a glass floor on the top... if you dare!",
          "Not worth the time and money, we paid the high price 99MYR/person to got to the high level, but it was so incredibly hot that we resisted only 10 minutes. Not much to see as atmosphere was foggy due to pollution and humidity. My wife asked at the entrance downstairs if there is",
          "Great view of the KL skyline! Cheaper than the Petronas Twin Towers and an amazing 360 degree view of KL They even got a small Caf\u00e9 at the top where you can enjoy a beverage or snack whilst looking over the city",
          "Looked better from afar than close up, attendants keen to sell you anything and everything. Previous mention of nearby 'nature park' outdated, it has been shut last couple of years.",
          "We are old couple and visit kuala lumpur for our holidays . We choose koala lumpur because of the tower ! We ate excited to see the twintower koala lumpur . we are not dissapointed with our holidays. The ticket price are very value, cheap. i suggest every people to visit here !",
          "You'll have the greatest view on KL and the glass view is most scary but one in a lifetime experience",
          "The weather was not very good as it was somehow misty. We saw some 10-15 km. Surprisingly we had to wait some time for going up, even with a short queue only. The coffee-shop (on the highest level) was empty, the staff obviously bored and not interested on business. The prices",
          "We only paid for the inside-viewing area at the top (RM49 each...about \u00a310GBP). If you fancy the outside views it will cost you double that. We did not book and had no problem mid-afternoon on a Monday (when the Petronas towers were closed) just strolling up and paying at the",
          "This a very tall Tower in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, so that visitors can enjoy the views of the city from high above. The entry fee is steep, but this is common for similar Towers in many other cities. Before visiting, ensure that the weather is good. Kuala Lumpur occasionally",
          "It was nice overall but I feel the fees here is exorbitant. The aquarium and zoo was more than expected however. Didn't get the chance to go to the top since weather conditions were not good. Make sure to be here when the weather is clear to get the best experience.",
          "KL Tower has been part of the plan and even bought a ticket in advance. It is a 30-minute walk from the hotel. Though it can be reached by Grab but it\u2019s nice to stroll and see the neighborhood as well. There is a shuttle at the entrance to take to the lobby. Then you need to",
          "will get a stunning view of the city from the top, but the staffs there are not professional. And the property has to change their interior soon.",
          "Go see This tower to get the best view of twin towers . There are different packages available to get your best view and pictures.",
          "Whilst it is good to get out in the open air of the top open deck, the experience is spoiled by the computer-generated voices on loudspeakers constantly announcing whose turn it is next in the projecting glass boxes. The enclosed deck below is quieter, far more spacious and the",
          "great view to take pics. specially from the galss box. It took a long time to for our turn... but it was worth it.",
          "Firstly the view is fabulous from any deck. We arrived at 6.30pm and were able to see light day to dark evening. Kuala Lumpur lit up at night is the best. We chose the restaurant because it is not expensive, especially when booked online considering it includes the tower fee.",
          "Nice view and fresh air, Can take breath deeply to get away from your distress, nice architecture of Malaysian government.",
          "We booked this tower on our own through trip advisor. We booked with sky bridge. It was a great experience to stand on the glass top. It was truly exiting. We stood on glass tops at both corners and had a photo shoots in both ends. The photos with both ends costed 180 riggits",
          "We had lunch at the restaurant, buffet style. Some of the food was average, some of it was fantastic. Selection was good. Overall, although it wasn't necessarily memorable I was happy with lunch. The views are outstanding, and can be seen from any of the tables. The restaurant",
          "We had dinner at the tower. Dinner was a buffet and had a variety of food. We thought it was okay. Nothing outstanding but okay. Drinks were quite expensive and the selection very limited. They had entertainment with a piano player and a singer. They were great as were the",
          "Great place with excellent views. However for the money I\u2019d rather buy a drink in one of Kuala Lumpur\u2019s skybars and enjoy it from a table and at night.",
          "I been to the Tower twice and I can really recommend it. The first time was in 2015 and I only visited the observation deck because it was raining. I was there during the sunset and stayed until it got dark. A good view over the city and the Petronas Twin Towers. But even better",
          "One of the highest sky decks in the world. Nice bird eye view over KL. We went all the way up to thesky deck with was very nice. They have glass boxes where you can take photos \u201don top of the city\u201d. I would recommend going here rather than Tein towers as it\u2019s higher observation",
          "Been enjoying the restaurant and the view. I am afraid of the elevator tho I feel suffocating \ud83d\ude02 but enjoying it the whole time up there.",
          "We went during the late afternoon and it was fairly quiet which worked to our bonus. We got the sky box tickets which allowed us to go to both levels. These tickets cost around \u00a318 each for two adults so reasonable. It was easy to go up and down as it\u2019s all by lifts. The views",
          "The day we visited the Skydeck was closed due to the weather (this includes the Skyboxes) however we still ventured up to the observation deck. This is currently the tallest tower in South East Asia and currently the 7th tallest in the world, however they are currently building",
          "KL tower is one of precious KL attractions. I went there in hope that the tower is as big and as high as the Seoul tower. But actually it's not. Lucky that I went there on weekday morning so not many people go up to the tower. However, I still felt that the tower is not as big",
          "We walked to the tower, it was a steep climb but well worth it. Pay the money and go up the tower. The views a beautiful, you can really see how big KL is",
          "I have to say the view here is just breathe taking! I spent alot of time here checking out how wonderful kuala lumpur is make sure to take alot of pictures while here you wont regret!",
          "Going to the top of this tower gives you a better view than the Petronas Towers (and it is cheaper). The top deck is awesome, there's a glass floor you can stand on and the employees will take pictures for you. I went during the day and really loved the view but I'm sure the",
          "Like most of tourist site in KL this landmark is badly managed and run down. Yes the view is nice but the surroundings, outlets, car park, shops are just dirty and did not changed since 15 years ago.",
          "Worth spending 30 minutes at the top level getting a good view of the city without looking through glass.",
          "We had already seen a few places in KL, so seeing it from this perspective was quite amazing as we could we recognize places we had been,,,looking through the telescopic lens was useful too...KL is quite modern and interesting city so well worth while seeing it from above! Nice",
          "It's a must see in KL. Quite expensive, but still worth it. For pictures in the skybox, get a que number at the entrance after coming out of the elevator. It's free, with own camera. They have guys taking photos for money, that you can get later on. We were there when the",
          "I read two other reviews here about some people took too much time in the Skybox while the line is really long. I can understand that but when me and my sister were there on a Wednesday , we only had 1.40 min to spend in the box. Really? A min and 40 secs? By the time we took",
          "we had a lovely time here at the menara during our honeymoon tour! It may not be in your check list to visit but try visiting",
          "We visited the restaurant for an afternoon tea with a difference. Buffet food was delicious, with lots of varieties. The staff were friendly, happy to help with a smile. The views from up there were amazing, looking down on KL and going round and round. It was relaxing and",
          "Its great place to spend a whole day. Eco forest in the heart of city and with free entry. Sky deck and sky box is an adrenaline pumping experience. Must visit place if you are in Kuala Lumpur. I have also written a blog post on this and you can check it out on my website, link",
          "The view from up there in the afternoon is spectacular, what more when you go up there at night. We celebrated a birthday at the revolving restaurant, food was not worth the price but if you are there for the atmosphere and view.. it is worth an experience as you sit and the",
          "We paid for the Sky deck and Sky box, which is twice the cost of the observation deck but allows you to go higher and be outside for better views. I'll preface the rest of this review by saying; I do not like lifts and am petrified of heights... The lift ride up was very",
          "A magnificent structure in the city. A must see attraction. There is a big hall at the basement which has a lift for going to the top of the tower. It is a very good experience reaching the tower top and the views from the tower are are excellent. The city skyline looked so",
          "It's been years since I last visited the KL Tower. When it first opened, I always compared it to CN tower and the one thing that was missing was the glass floor. Now KL Tower has made up for that missing floor with not one but two glass boxes. The Sky Box 1 and 2. Most people",
          "I went in the afternoon when it had rained and was hazy so was limited to the lower viewing area. Suggest you go in the morning as the rain tends to be in the afternoon. Still got great views of the city including the Petronus Towers. This tower doesn't have to be booked in",
          "I love the view!!! definitely my highlight of the trip I did! I was glad I choose to visit this tower instead of the twins tower. The view is breath taking especially around the sunset, besides, you will see the twins tower as well. So, it was totally worth the visit! I don't",
          "experience the city skyline , be prepared to wait for a 20 minute Que line but was worth while when you reach the summit. good and friendly staff",
          "Efficient entry system, we got an over 55s discount. Go for the Sky Deck option which gives you entry to the Observation Deck and Sky Box (if you dare) & you are not time restricted. Slight queue for lifts both up and down, but not a problem. Cafe prices seemed very expensive.",
          "It was wonderful day in Kuala Lumpur so decided to the opportunity to go to the Menara we choose the sky deck tickets and it worth the price . You will enjoy the 360 scenery of Kuala Lumpur and have the experience of standing on the glass deck . If you have the time and the",
          "Sadly this has been a huge disappointment. The ticket guy gladly sold us 99rm tickets saying it was only a 15 minute wait, and if we wanted to jump the lift queues we could get the lift half way up and then walk. We did this to the top, all good so far. We went to the sky box",
          "Arrived at the ticket counter and was told there would be a 15 minute wait to get into the sky box and observation deck. We paid 297RM to then discover when at the top we had a 2 HOUR wait...deciding to leave it we started walking down the stairs to leave. We found the middle",
          "Tower itself was okay. But buffet was quite expensive and not much to eat. Also qualify was so so. Tower turns around 360\u2019 so you can view all the KL city view while you eat. That\u2019s the only thing good. For visitors it might be good chance to eat there.",
          "Menara KL was a bit painful to reach using public transport but we were glad to see this unique tower. Earlier they also used to have ziplining from the tower which was amazing, but now it was probably closed. Make sure weather is good, else you will not enjoy a lot.",
          "We chose the KL Tower over the Petronas Tour as we thought that the views would be better with a full 360deg and a view OF the Petronas Towers together with Sky Box and were not disappointed. Always helps to get a proper aerial view of a city to help explore and we were lucky to",
          "The visit to this tower is quite nice especially in evening when the weather is good. Do opt for Sky Deck ticket as it is really worth it. The sky box at sky deck are nice. Overall a good visit.",
          "We purchased \"skip the queue\" tickets from the hotel we were staying in - Totally worth the extra few bob to pass the lines of expectant tourists. We went to the very top and the 360' views were absolutely amazing and dependent upon timng you can miss the crowds - If you are in",
          "They allowed the tour bus to drive right up to the front entrance because one of the tour member was handicapped and had to use a wheelchair. There was a line up but it was not very long. Took only 10 minutes to reach the elevator. The observation deck is enclosed but it was a",
          "Menara Kuala Lumpur in itself is a sight to see because it's one of the highest points of Kuala Lumpur. Upon reaching the gate of Menara (we went here riding a Grabcar), we had to wait for a shuttle that took us up to the entrance of the tower. We decided to just take photos",
          "35 MYR to take a taxi from KL Tower to KLCC from the official taxi ticket counter.....and the taxi driver asked for my receipt so he came claim something back....what a joke.....I wonder how much they would charge to take me home to Subang? Make sure that you can call a",
          "The sky deck was closed on our visit so we bought tickets to the observation deck and I have to say it was 2.5 hours of my life wasted. This place is an insane tourist attraction so 2 out of the 2.5 hours we were there, we spent in line. The line was actually the only good part,",
          "Don't settle for lower floors, the view from the uppermost deck is worth your while. Don't forget to get your numbered ticket for Sky Box 1 (number 2 is not interesting, only number 1 has a view of the Petronas towers). You might wait for an hour (go around sunset), and when",
          "Having already been to the Protonas tower the views from this tower were even better got some great family photos in the skyboxes, a must do. The walk up to the tower also great through the jungle walk.",
          "This place is very beautifully made, indeed. However, there is not a single item there, which is priced according to reasonable logic. Everything is most expensive there. From souvenirs to postal cards to food and all the rest. It seems as though the bosses there have imagined a",
          "The tower view was excellent so you can see the whole city! And if you're brave, the skybox is for you. The aquarium is good with lots of different fish but if you're looking for something a little more interactive you should go to the Mini Zoo. The Mini Zoo was bigger than I",
          "There are a plethora of things to do at Kuala Lumpur / Menara tower, including an aquarium, an upside down house and a 360 degree revolving restaurant \u2013 we just went to the indoor and outdoor viewing areas at the top of the tower. Our first port of call was the outer Sky Deck,",
          "One of the most famous place to visit in KL. This multi purpose tower has all telecommunications equipment and separate levels for restaurants and observation decks. To visit lowest observation desk, you must buy a ticket and it will cost you 49RM. But its totaly worth going up",
          "It was a nice and new experinece going up 270+ meters out of the 400+ meters tall building in just a few minutes. Then had a breathtaking view of KL on all sides. Though a very short visit but worth the view. It took us less time in cue cos we were in a group tour. There was",
          "Absolutely must see - a great work of art. Book in advance if possible to avoid disappointment. A dream visit, experience and photo opportunity. Lots of food and other activities outside too, especially for kids.",
          "The KL Tower is certainly worth visiting, it\u2019s cheaper than the Petronas Towers but the view is equally stunning.",
          "Loads of people with busses going to the tower.Have to to get to the top of the tower. We enjoyed the forest walk very close to the tower and it\u2019s free.",
          "Another attraction should be the KL Tower. Awesome view best time to go is 6.30pm to 7.30 to watch the transition from light to dark and watch as the City lights up..... Forget the revolving restaurant nothing but bad experiences....",
          "Ths ws quick and easy . No lines. Purchase your ticket to observation deck and sky box and make ur way. Beautiful views of petronas from the observation deck. Pics are taken of you to purchase . Sky box was even more wow. No shoes allowed. I\u2019m afraid of heights tho but this was",
          "The skybox and sky deck is the highlight of the visit. We visited early but still there was 20 mins wait. The view without glass is amazing and best thing....you can stay as long as you want. Observation deck is comparable boring. Spend a little more and go for the sky deck. The",
          "Took the Bus here one day to visit this area and only got to visit the Textile Museam as works were being carried out to access to museam and library",
          "Make sure you get your ticket for glass box as you go onto floor as there are big queues for the one box facing Petronas towers and they do not give you tickets unless you asked. Felt it was disorganised but good views",
          "Finally, we were able to visit the place. A good nice view of the City Center from above. There are some shops, restaurant at the top where you could enjoy dining more than 400meters above! Overall, we had a good tour.",
          "Cool spot to spend a few hours in KL, especially if you want to take a picture of the Petronas Towers (they\u2019re vis-a-vis). Pretty crowded, we had to wait 4h to take a photo in the transparent cage (extra charge) - it\u2019s not worth the wait.",
          "Nice place to visit and take pictures. Close to the city center and nice to walk around. Is also 1 stop of the tourist bus.",
          "Its easier if you booked on 'klook' and way cheaper. I prefer to use grab toward there. i love the services, they helped us nicely and the managed all the visitors very well.. I love the beautiful view from top the tower.. I wish I can go there again and try the skybox",
          "We walked from our hotel, Renaissance KL to the shuttle bus stop at the base of the Tower and were ferried the rest of the way to the Tower entrance. Top tip, don't walk it. It may seem like a good idea at the time, Google maps may says it's only 20mins but it's a trap. You will",
          "The lines were ridiculously long. This stop was included in our tour. It was okay once we got to the top, and the views were nice. However, I wouldn't do it again. Even with the views of the city, the best photo I got was the one of the actual tower.",
          "Quite a hefty place to visit. Local residents get a discount but tourists pay quite a bit. The view is nice, especially around sunset time. There is a 100 second time limit in skybox. Good to try for once.",
          "Went early (9am) and there was no queuing and not crowded. Very enjoyable at that time. Fantastic views right around KL. Definitely recommend as it gives a good perspective on the city. Used Grab to get there and back with no issues.",
          "The must visit tourist attraction in Kuala.. This giant Tower is 7th tallest in the world and biggest tower for Telecommunications in Asia. Having 360 Degree revolving observation deck with wonderful restaurant on top. Can spend one night to see the whole Kuala City in a",
          "We almost didn\u2019t visit the Tower, but so glad we did. We had already been up the Petronas Towers so weren\u2019t sure it would offer anything different, but it did. The sky deck is surrounded by glass walls and open to the elements which in itself was fabulous, but to the have a sky",
          "This tower is world's 7th biggest tower. Here you get Observatory tower for beautiful panoramic view.",
          "This is one of the important and famous towers of the world. The view from the top is fantastic. Watching the lit-up Petronas twin towers at night, from atop the Menara Kuala Lumpur is one of my favourite sights in KL. Great for kids and adults alike. Must see when in Kuala",
          "We just booked the observation deck tickets which were very good value online. The service was good, and the view from the top is breathtaking. Were free to roam about and spend as much time as we wanted up there. Would 100% recommend! Not sure there\u2019s any need to pay double for",
          "We visited this tower and the Petronas Towers and this one is far better. The views are just stunning and you an stay up as long as you want. We went up to the sky deck and enjoyed a drink in the bar at there. It is worth the extra cost to go right up to the top. If you are on",
          "Nice tourist attraction. Kids friendly. Price of the photograph on sky box is RM180 for 3 printouts. Sky observation area was nice as well. Skybox is open air and hot but the view was wonderful. There are 2 skyboxes, one with KLCC view and one without. The one without was nice",
          "We chose to do this tower over the Petronis as this one had better reviews and is certainly higher. Its also cheaper. There are various options with the tickets from just the observation deck to all inclusive and experiencing the glass bottom boxes 1 and 2. We began backwards",
          "Actually a telecommunication tower, 7th tallest in the world. Offers great view from the observation deck and the sky deck.",
          "The Menara or tower offers stunning views. Its worth to buy the ticket to reach the sky deck from where the city and many landmarks become visible.",
          "We recently went to the Menara tower which is a sight all on its own the area has lots going on and was certainly worth the visit. The views from the sky deck were amazing. One does need to take into account there is three to four lifts that go up and down the tower and in the",
          "Worth a visit we went up to the sky deck fantastic views of the city, we went up just before sunset which is a good time to go.",
          "The KL Tower delivers some great views over the city, and is easily accessible from central Kuala Lumpur. Certainly worth a visit when in the vicinity.",
          "We arrived at 5 pm here, but the place was so crowdy that we couldn\u2019t Take the pictures on the light. We\u2019ve waited more than 3h. The pics are Not so qualitative in the dark, but it still deserved it.",
          "Located at Kuala Lumpur, the tower is the 7th tallest free standing structure in the world at 421 meters. It is a communication tower with an observation deck. The tower is constructed on top of a hill. It is the highest viewpoint in the city. It is accessible using the monorail",
          "There's not much to see in KL, but the tower is good. Well. nothing special, but you can capture some nice looks atop.",
          "Inside view from the skydeck is awesome not to be missed. View of the twin towers is also very good.",
          "We went for lunch in the revolving restaurant. Best way to do it and a cool way to have a meal. Must do if in KL",
          "You can see the whole city 360 degrees from the observation deck. It is one of the best locations in KL after PETRONAS twin towers and there is also top deck from where you can get a better view",
          "Really enjoyed the view from the observation floor. 360 we had a private tour guide who showed us all the. Important buildings. It was really interesting. There is another floor and restaurant we did not have time to visit. Super high speed elevators and very well organised by",
          "Get a great bird's eyeview from the sky deck or have a great dinner with a mesmerizing night view of the KL skyline.",
          "The Menara is also known as KL tower and we took a Grab cab to reach this place. The ower is one of the tallest buildings of the world (less taller than Petronas Towers though). The view from here is quite spectacular and there are good points to click photo and selfies.",
          "Tried redeeming the online voucher at the ticket counter on 29th December at around 8 PM with my spouse only to hear that the admission is denied due to long queue and was asked by the staff to come tomorrow at around 7-7.30 PM. When we went the next day at the said time to hear",
          "I was on the tower the dec 23. It was very crowded on the base and the ticket vending machines wouldn't work with several credit cards. So I do the first queue to get the ticket for approx 10 bucks. Huge line to get up the tower. They only had one! Elevator to go up and another",
          "Well worth a visit for the peerless views over Kuala Lumpur. It's a smoothly run operation, and once on the observation deck one is at leisure to complete as one sees fit, with no pressure.",
          "Expensive and kinda ugly, the view is kind of cute though, for like 10mn. Do not go here by foot, you\u2019ll end up either having a mental breakdown or a divorce.",
          "Fantastic must do in KL. Except for the arrogant selfish primadonna who dominated the glass floor for 20 minutes who then demanded respect",
          "If you are visiting KL Tower Observation deck specially at night then it will be a waste of money. No view all light reflection of shops from observation deck. Magnifier don't work at all. Visit Skydeck in a daytime rather than Night you will get some view Skydeck can be",
          "I visited on my birthday as I saw on Facebook profile cover photo (attached) that on your birthday you get free entry. Well I was very excited and when I arrived there I was told that was for Malaysia passport holders only. Well there's no terms and conditions on that photo \ud83d\ude14.",
          "Nice 360 degree view of Kuala Lumpur so you get a great idea of how the city is structured, old and new buildings is very noticeable so you can see what areas are popular for people to live and work!! Cost about 69 ringgit for observation desk and it takes 58 seconds in the",
          "If you're looking to see Kuala Lumpur from above, this is the place to go! Make sure you go in a sunny morning or afternoon, if you want to have access to Sky Deck. Otherwise, only Observation Dek will be available.",
          "I love The whole idea of menara kuala lumpur. The glass box with petronas twin tower view is stunning. No need for earlier reservation.",
          "The place smells like a tourist trap from the very beginning. Souvenirs, photos of you taken so you can buy them, quite steep price in comparison to KL average... I could forgive it all, as I knew what I was getting into. However, I thought that the view would compensate for it",
          "Stands 421 meters tall, the KL Tower is the 7th highest telecommunication tower in the world wit its base set on top of the hill. From the facility entrance below you may choose to walk on foot going up, wait for a shuttle van that service tourist going up and down or if you",
          "Great for views of KL from above. You get 360 views of all the skyscrapers and the rest of KL. Highly recommend a visit here.",
          "Wonderful view, just come at 6 PM more even good. I'll think the price for sky deck is way to expensive. Can I get discount for next time visit?",
          "I have been before and this time went at night as I'd been through the day before . I highly recommend as great value for money and you can see the whole city",
          "The KL Tower is a nice tourist spot to visit while visiting Kuala Lumpur. It's about 420 meters tall. There are two decks in the tower to get a view of the city. The highest one is the skydeck, where you can a great view outdoors of the whole city. And you get a chance to take",
          "Cost 99MR to go all the way too (skydeck+observatory) worth experiencing, nice view of city and of course Petronas (Twin)Towers",
          "This is one of the best places in Kuala Lumpur.you can enjoy the view from 400 m above the ground.i personally don't recommend the 360 restaurant since the food quality is low and the point is only the rotating restaurant.",
          "There was a long wait to go up to the sky deck. The view from the sky deck is very nice. There were not a lot of people on the sky deck and so it was easy to get pictures from where ever we wanted. We walked down to the observation deck after we finished looking around on the",
          "It is quite cheap and affordable to go there by taxi. We combined the visit with the 360 atmosphere restaurant and enjoyed it very much!!",
          "Although this was a short trip, it doesn't take long to take in the overview of the entire city from a 360 degree view of Kuala Lumpur. Highly recommend.......if you're not afraid of heights:-)",
          "It was a short, unique, expensive experience, going high up have photos at the open sky deck and sky box (allowed for 2 min inside) then to observation deck and expensive snacks \ud83d\ude02 then coming down to take ur photos with very high expensive price but still beautiful",
          "Has to be one of the top things to do in KL, after a queuing for a short time for the lift I soon found myself at the sky deck then had plenty of time for photos and to absorb the view. Due to the long queue I didn\u2019t go on the sky box (section on the sky deck that has a glass",
          "Pricey in every thing Admission fees Photos also But nice few from the observation deck We enjoyed the tour Recommended",
          "even though we didnt go to the sky tower , we were around the building hanging out partying etc . This will be in your list of must visit in the KL city , so make full use of it . You can enjoy being around both day and night in here .",
          "An out of experience visit, a bit expensive buffet diner but with great view of KL at nite with the restaurant continuously rotating thus continuously change of KL view, food is so so but great experience dining whilst spending time with family",
          "It's a nice way to get a 360 view of KL, not too crowed, but it really is all about the view and not much else! The outdoor deck is closed when its raining so we weren't able to visit it.",
          "Highly recommend getting the skydeck. Its a beautiful experience seeing the KL skyline. It's abit pricey but well worth it. They will also take pictures with a dslr camera which u can buy afterwards. The staff there wasn't that helpful. So we just left",
          "We really enjoyed the tower as a culmination of our city tour, taking in the palace, war memorial, botanic gardens and cricket club. Looking down at all the places we had just been taken to helped us to get an idea of the city. Memorable, and certainly recommended.",
          "Like almost every other place in KL, you better be early. You should do the sky view first, having a good 360 view around KL. Have a drink in the cafe and enjoy the view, maybe you can find some spots in the ocean of buildings. You can see the bird park, mosque and many other",
          "RM 99 to go to Sky Deck. Would recommend it since it\u2019s open air and allows great views over KL 360 degrees plus you can experience 1 of the sky boxes which have glass floors. You can take decent pictures of Petronas without going to Sky Cafe too. Normal deck is nothing to",
          "So you pay 99RM to go to the sky deck and observation price, which I was more than happy to pay. When you get to the top and want to take a decent photo of the Petronas Towers, you have to pay a minimum of 50RM to take the photo in the Sky Cafe through purchasing something.",
          "I purchased the observation and sky deck ticket for about 99RM. Would highly recommend the sky deck as it allows you to see 360 outdoor views of Kuala Lumpur, as well as taking photos (professional or from your phone) in the glass box that extends outside the tower. The",
          "This place was really nice and surely deserves one visit. I would also recommend to go to the top & not just the observation deck as real enjoyment is at the top. I will not tell you more about the things in details but you will surely enjoy this when you will visit to the top.",
          "Kuala Lumpur one of the famous place is Menara Kuala Lumpur. when you visit Kuala Lumpur try to visit it. here you can see all the kuala Lumpur. and also have nice restaurant",
          "This is tallest building in Kuala Lumpur and one of the tallest buildings in the world. There is observation deck and sky deck. Sky deck is very costly. You get to see nice views from observation deck as well. You can see twin towers from there. There is gift shop on one of the",

          "We went to Meara Tower for dinner in Atmosphere 360. Eating in the restaurant also included visit to the observation deck (one floor down). It was great choice eating in the restaurant because it is slowly rotating and gives you a great view of the whole city. The restaurant",
          "I am sure that the view is spectacular from the top, looking up is pretty cool too. You can see this tower from just about everywhere in KL.",
          "if one want to see kualalumpur at a glance then menara kuala lumpur is a must. Although there is a fee to be paid but its worth. Try to avoid buying an souvenirs from the shops that are present at the ground level. You can buy same stuff at half price from chinatown market.",
          "Now it has skybox which is awesome. Completely new look. Good Arial view of Kuala Lumpur city. Sky deck is full of fresh air",
          "The view from the open skydeck is just breathtaking. Go there 1h before the sunset to see the lights turn on. While the Petronas Twin Towers are mainly stunning to look at from the ground, you have to go up the KL Tower for the view.",
          "Very great hight wd very popular name it's symbol of malaysia high class of culture . Food . People and great tourist attractions for everyone.",
          "Skyline limit not end here. We went upto Observation deck and the view from here was not described in words. Got a view of the city from this Minar was awesome. They installed so many binaculars on deck and one can have a different type of glimpses of the city through this.",
          "To take a view of the city with powerful binoculars is a cherishing experience. Lot of other attractions are also available there.",
          "To get a view of Kuala Lumpur from the top is a very lovely memory. High quality binoculars installed there provide great experience.",
          "high obove the skyline. optional thriller experience in the transperent skyboxes 300 meter high over KL. forget the over valued petronas towers, go half the price the more than double the height! optional 360' revolving restaurant. stunning view day and night.",
          "Fantasic views of both sunset and night Food really was exceptionally disgusting, every prawn my family had on thier plate a black vein running through, showed it to 3 waiters and 2 chefs and they said that it was ok and very popular dish and that it may be my first time to eat",
          "The views are the best in town, even better than from the Petronas towers. I coupled this with dinner in the 360 restaurant, it was a great evening. Best approaches from the canopy walk from Eco Park as the sun sets. Be sure to check out the 100 year old tree that was preserved,",
          "Great to be here than the petronas as the observation deck on the former is on the 45th floor as compared to this being on the 101st floor, and if you are ready to pay 99 Ringets you get access to a rooftop view of the whole city, not great if it\u2019s raining as it\u2019s tall enough",
          "Nice views of KL. Gets a good view of the Petronas towers but at a price! Long enough queue for the sky box",
          "A great way to get a birds eye view of the city. This is also cheaper and less crowded than Petronas Tower.",
          "oh ho what a fine high rise. total height is about 421 meter. and sky deck height is 288. here you find revolving restaurant. in sky deck you take photo of city also go to observation deck",
          "We made a mistake in our tickets; getting the tickets to KL TOWER instead of Petronas Twin Tower. It's a good mistake. You not only get a full view of the city higher than the Twin Tower; its a 360 breathtaking view of the city. No regret... I highly recommend.",
          "It\u2019s one of the top attraction of the city Although u need to pay to get there and it might be a one cue as well.But once u go to the top it\u2019s a scenic view of the whole city,Nice.",
          "Enjoyable tower with beautiful view of the city of Kuala Lumpur. Delicious food at the highest restaurant in the city.",
          "A must visit. I kept on seeing the tower from all perspectives and then stumbled onto the entrance when I exited the forest walk. Really nice view of KL. Went all the way up to Sky Deck and had to line up to take photos in the sky box, but worth the wait.",
          "I visit this building when I visit Malaysia first time. First I saw the KL Tower, it looks not that tall and huge, but when I enter the tower, it was huge and tall. Also, I could go up, and I could see the beautiful sight. I was awesome!",
          "I went here twice (once in 2012 and previously in November 2018). I enjoyed the Sky Deck and Sky Box.A little bit pricier but its worth the experience and view from above. I came at around 9.20am on a Friday,it just opened during that time and there were no crowds.Advisable to",
          "Took in the views from the observation deck. Different perspective of the city from the views from the twin towers. Enjoyable",
          "If you want to see the best view of Kuala Lumpur, this is the place. You can make the best pictures of the Petronas towers from here. What I like is the fact that you can walk around in 360 degrees and see the whole city in any angle. Absolutely a must do and see.",
          "It is located in the Bukit Nanas area and I visited it along with a friend. Our entry was free as we had a KL Pass card. We went to its revolving restaurant on top \"Atmosphere 360\" for High tea and it was a good experience. It is a good way to dine in the sky with nice panoramic",
          "Quite pricy. Its cost 99 MYR for foreigner and 71 MYR for Malaysian citizen to goes up to the top (sky deck+sky box) Have an amazing view of Kuala Lumpur city skyline. And had to wait in the long queue for the sky box just for photography. Nothing else can do. There is a cafe",
          "KL tower is a through boring place with no one to guide about history if project. Also there r very less people inside to guide you the ways. Also the food in the restaurant above us one of the worst I ever had with the poorest of poor table service I have ever noticed. Shear",
          "If you are in Kuala lumpur, this KL tower is a must visit for an amazing view. Go at night and you get a gorgeous view. Observation deck is RM 49 for Adult and RM 29 for child (4-12 years). For sky deck tickets - the top most floor the price is RM 99 for Adult and RM 52 for",

          "While staying in Kuala Lumpur during my vacation I chose to go Menara KL for city view instead of Petronas Twin Towers.i am glad that it was a good decision. Me and my cousin bought 2 tickets 199 Ringgit each for Sky deck view point. And we decided to go there half an hour",
          "At night you can enjoy beautiful kl tower night show ...................enjoy good time at night with take photo",
          "Good place to visit, you'll better book online for the entrance fee because it has better price. Theres also mini zoo and upside-down house around. Quite expensive in my opinion but seeing your kids have fun, what to complain?",
          "Worth a visit as you do get some good views. It is worthwhile to pay little extra for the sky box definitely. Good fun.",
          "Booked the sky deck online via Klook which was simple and cost less than the advertised price. Arrived to find no queues (around 4/4.30pm) and went straight in. The views were fantastic, and the sky box was cool. There are two boxes, one facing the Petronas towers, for which",

We bought a combo package which included Sky Box, Sky Observation Deck, Mini Zoo, Aquarium & Upside Down House. \nYou can take pictures on the glasses it\u2019s scary but  worth a try. I'd highly recommend going here if you're going to be in KL.",
          "The Kuala Lumpur Tower (KL Tower; Malay: Menara Kuala Lumpur) is a communications tower located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Its construction was completed on 1 March 1995. It features an antenna that increases its height to 421 metres (1,381 \u2026",

          "A must visit for a bird eye\u2019s view of the city of Kuala Lumpur. Scary was how I\u2019d describe the glass panel walkway. Then again, I\u2019m kind of faint hearted when it comes to such stuff. Wish they\u2019d have more restaurants at the foot of this \u2026",
          "About USD23 gets you up to a very beautiful skydeck with sweeping views of this beautiful city; go in the late afternoon and see the sunset! Compared to other things in this city it's rather expensive, but is a totally worthwhile view. Do this instead of the Petronas bridge.",
          "It is beautiful the way the city lights up. Inside the tower, you will get showrooms, adventure activities, and restaurants providing diners with a panoramic view of the city. It\u2019s quite pricey but you get an amazing view from above.",
          "It's quite expensive for what it's worth. The glass box is a nice experience but 25 USD for 1.40min countdown in the glass box..? Hmm. A lot of waiting time as well. Stunning views though so you have to really consider if it's worth it for you. My reasoning: for once only.",
          "We went there during the school holidays. The queue was too long so we decided against going up the tower. Instead we spent our time there at the zoo and upside down house. The kids loved the zoo but the upside down house just ok. We \u2026",

          "Came here with my friends. But did not go up in the end. Upon arrival, there were very friendly staff who introduced us to different packages to go to different parts of the tower. But after much consideration, we felt that it wasn't really worth the money. It's just a normal tower up there, nothing much going on.",
          "The view is spectacular. Everything's perfect except for one little thing, one of the staff told us to climb the stairs from the observation deck to the restaurant. After we refused only then he offered us to use the elevator.\nI'm pretty certain the guests don't use the emergency stairs judging from the look of it.",

          "Extremely busy, long queues, but all worthy because the view you get from the top is just breathtaking! The price (99R or 20\u00a3) for the sky deck and sky box may seem a bit much if you're on a budget, but think of it as a once in a lifetime thing. I went in the afternoon, but would love to go back in the evening and see the city lights.",
          "The city looks stunning from the sky deck after dawn. 5/5 will go again when returning to KL.",

          "If you want to see the nice view of KL then this is the best place to go. The best time to go there is sunset until the evening time as you can see the stunning view of the city. The skybox is highly recommended and don't forget to take photographs here. You can also try the 360 restaurant.",

          "nice place to book for evening tea or lunch. Then you can enjoy the 360 degree view of KL from revolving restaurant",
          "Great experience and panoramic view over KL and its modern skyline. The best time is definitely just before sunset and stay to see the illuminated city in the dark. Just one downside at the Observation Deck after sunset are the reflections \u2026",

          "So its the Kualalumpur tower or known as KL tower one of the tallest tower 8n world. From here top view is really awesome and you see the entire kualalumpur city even the genting high land. And can stay for 30 sec in the sky deck for amazing picture and a thrilling glass floor",
          "Well, its not the KL Tower itself that is getting the 5 stars but rather the Bukit Nanas canopy trail. A forest/jungle on the middle of a bustling City. Not really huge, but it is always great to have nature being taken care of in the midst of developement surrounding it",
          "Good place to visit the price to go up the not so expensive for local visitors",
          "Stunning views and electric ambience makes it a must go place when you visit Kuala Lumpur. Especially at night, view from the top looks magical!",
          "This is one of the best place to visit in kualampur...it's more than 406 meters height..if u reach top of kl tower u can enjoy the whole view of city..there are two types of deck in kl tower sky deck and observation deck..we purchased \u2026",

          "It sure is nice place you can see KL under your feet",

While the view is indeed amazing, I'm not sure if pricing is justified.\nYou can see petronas towers from up there and gives you amazing view of Kuala Lumpur. \nWould suggest not going to observation deck as it has a very bad view. Take sky deck ticket for a better experience.",
          "Definitely a place that you shouldn\u2019t miss when visiting Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Along with the Petronas Twin Towers, Menara KL Tower is easily Malaysia\u2019s most recognizable and popular landmark. Constructed in 1994, the tower stands at 421 \u2026",
          "Waiting time is extremely long and there's no clear indication where you're supposed to queue for each type of ticket. View is amazing though!",
          "Stunning views of the Petronas Towers. Pricing should be reviewed to encourage more patronage. I suggest just the observation deck for half the price. Sky deck over rated",
          "Classic KL 'thing to do'. Superb view from the observation platform, however, that's about it. You can go higher and you can eat at the restaurant, but the main thing is the views..",
          "Very nice scenery , the tower is near to KL Eco Park (forest in the middle of big city)",
          "Kaula Lumpur tower, observation deck and sky deck, Watch city from a height, awesome scenes from such a height. Observation deck is a bit on the lower floor than sky deck. I suggest if you visit this place, they try to buy sky deck tickets \u2026",

          "Oky can see from up/bird view. for me not much interesting. But good place to visit once",
          "Absolutely breathtaking views of Kuala Lumpur, you can see the Twin Towers as well. Beautiful sights, you should definitely visit the observation deck.",

          "Great for first time visitors, you can see twin towers and view of whole Kualalumpur from Menara KL tower, sky box has glass floor and taking photographs in  sky box is adveturous. You can also see the video story of making of Menara tower , before the exit of Menara tower.",
          "Malaysia iconic place.. the zoo is another good thing added there",
          "Went here for dinner at Atmosphere 360. This is a moving restaurant at the top of the building where you can see the whole city from above.",
          "It's a bit pricey but if there is a real clear day than it's worth it. I did enjoy it a lot.",
          "You have to visit to this place.\nNeed to see the beauty of KL from top\nSpace Box is awesome",

        "wiki": "Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) is a multipurpose development area in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The area is located around Jalan Ampang, Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Binjai, Jalan Kia Peng and Jalan Pinang. There are also hotels within walking distance such as G Tower, Mandarin Oriental, Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur and InterContinental Kuala Lumpur.\nDesigned to be a city within a city, the 100-acre site hosts the tallest twin buildings in the world, a shopping mall, office buildings and several hotels. A public park and a mosque have also been built in the area and are open to everyone. The whole project is cooled via district cooling located on the property.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site of the Kuala Lumpur City Centre was historically part of an affluent suburban residential area north of the old Kuala Lumpur town, linked to the town via Ampang Road and populated by bungalows and mansions dating as far back as the colonial early-20th century. The centrepiece of the area was the original site of the Selangor Turf Club, with many houses constructed around the site to capitalise on views of the racing course. As large scale development moved northwards from old Kuala Lumpur town after the 1950s, development of the area gradually shifted from low-density residential homes to high-density commercial complexes and offices, raising the appeal of developing the suburb into a new commercial centre for Kuala Lumpur. In 1988, the Selangor Turf Club site and adjoining residential parcels were sold to be cleared away for the KLCC project; the Turf Club was subsequently relocated to Serdang. In the subsequent years after the relocation of the Turf Club, more surrounding residential plots were acquired for further development of KLCC.\n\n\n== Development zone ==\nKLCC is a 100-acre land area with mixed developments in various stages of construction. The area is divided into several plots of land, each with a specific purpose.\n\nZoning is based on the KLCC Masterplan.\n\n\n== Offices ==\nOffices in the KLCC area are homes to the largest companies in Malaysia in which the Petronas Twin Towers is the centrepiece.\n\n\n=== Petronas Twin Towers ===\n\nConstructed between 1993 and 1998, the Petronas Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2004. Currently, it still holds the record for the tallest twin buildings in the world. It is the headquarters of Petronas, a Fortune 100 state-owned oil company and also the largest company in Southeast Asia.\nThe towers and the mall below were designed by Argentinian born architect C\u00e9sar Pelli. Construction started in 1991 and was completed 7 years later, in the midst of Asian Financial Crisis and Reformasi movement. Due to the soil conditions of the site, the buildings were built on one of the deepest foundations in the world.  The Building Services engineer contractor was Flack + Kurtz which is currently part of the WSP | Parsons Brinkerhoff Company.\nThe 88-storey towers were built using mostly reinforced concrete, with steel-and-glass facades to resemble Islamic motifs which were intended to reflect the official and majority religion of Malaysia. The cross section of the tower resembles Rub el Hizb, which further solidifies the Islamic motif in the tower design.\n\n\n=== Menara Exxon Mobil ===\n\nMenara Exxon Mobil was completed 1 January 1997 and it is the headquarters of the Malaysian subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, one of the largest listed companies in the world.\nThe 126 m (413 ft), 30-storey tower is a rectangular shaped building, with a virtually column-free interior. For aesthetics, the north and south elevations are set-back at level 5, while the north elevation facing the public park is further set-back at levels 22 and 26\n\n\n=== Menara Carigali ===\n\nOfficially Menara 3 Petronas, this tower is a 60-story tower which was completed in 2012. The tower is connected with the shopping mall Suria KL\nThe tower is also designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli with construction started in 2006 and finished in 2012. The tower has a separate entrance facing the Mandarin Oriental hotel and also has a tunnel link towards Lot D1. Lot D1 will be the site of a future development by the owner, KLCC Properties.  Like the Petronas Twin Towers, the Building Services Engineer was Flack + Kurtz.\nThe cross section of the tower features two geometric shapes, a square and a rectangle. The rectangle shape in the building starts at the ground floor and extends up to the 40th floor. The triangle shape extends to the top of the tower. At the top of the tower, a crown completes the design. It is expected the crown will hold the tower's company logo.\n\n\n=== Menara Maxis ===\n\nMenara Maxis is the headquarters of Maxis Communications, one of Malaysia's largest telecommunication companies.\n\n\n== Suria KLCC ==\n\nSuria KLCC is currently the only and main commercial centre in the KLCC area. The shopping mall occupies space underneath the Petronas Twin Towers and shares its parking lot with it. The six-story shopping mall was extended to Menara Carigali in 2011. There are plans to extend the mall to Lot K and also Lot D1 as well.\nThe mall is linked to the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre via an underground pedestrian tunnel, which in turn is connected to the Bukit Bintang shopping district via an elevated pedestrian walkway.\nThe Building Services Engineer was Flack + Kurtz who is currently part of the WSP | Parsons Brinkerhoff Company.\n\n\n== Hotels ==\nThere are two hotels in the KLCC area. Mandarin Oriental is the main hotel which sits between Suria KLCC and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre.\nTraders Hotel, which is owned by Petronas and run by Shangri-La Hotels, connects directly with the convention centre. This hotel has 571 rooms.\n\n\n== Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre ==\n\nThe KLCC area has a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) convention centre known as the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. The total function area is around 216,000 square feet (20,100 m2). The convention centre is directly connected with the Traders Hotel. The Impiana Hotel, which is owned and operated by KLCC Properties, developer of the KLCC area, is connected via a walk bridge. In the master plan, there will be several more buildings to be built near or on the convention centre area.\n\n\n== Binjai on the Park ==\nBinjai on the Park is the only residential area in the project. The residential space is two 42-story buildings having an unobstructed view of the Petronas Twin Towers. It is designed by Allen Jack + Cottier (known famously as AJ+C), the Australian-based architect with regional presence in Malaysia, Vietnam and China. The residential towers is the most expensive in Malaysia with a 19,500 square feet penthouse has been sold for a record RM50 million.\n\n\n== Public area ==\n\nAt the centre of the property lies KLCC Park. The park is one of the last designs of notable Brazilian park designer Roberto Burle Marx. The park holds a jogging track, a public swimming pool, several children's playground and a man-made lake complete with water fountains.\nThe area also has a mosque known as As Syakirin Mosque which has the capacity to hold 12,000 people. Naturally, many religious activities such as Friday prayers are conducted here.\n\n\n== Access ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nKLCC is served by a light rapid transit (LRT) line at  KJ10  KLCC station, served by the 5 Kelana Jaya Line. The underground station is located in the basement of Avenue K, a shopping complex opposite Suria KLCC across Jalan Ampang. The station is connected to Suria KLCC via an underground pedestrian walkway. It is also a bus hub for the RapidKL bus network, the largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur.\nA dedicated taxi stand, which utilises the coupon system, is available at the shopping mall entrance. Patrons who do not wish to use the system have the option to walk up to another taxi stand which is situated on the main road.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\nAlthough the area is bordered by 5 main roads, main road access is through Jalan Ampang, Jalan Sultan Ismail and the Ampang\u2013Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (AKLEH). The AKLEH access is quite unique in the sense that the highway has direct tunnel access to the area's extensive underground parking lot.\nKLCC is also connected to Jalan Ampang via an underground tunnel.\n\n\n=== Other access ===\nThe developer (Petronas) has spent RM100 million as part of its social contribution programme to build an elevated, air-conditioned walkway from the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre to Bukit Bintang shopping district. From there, pedestrians can access the  MR6  Bukit Bintang and  MR7  Raja Chulan Monorail stations on the 8 KL Monorail line, and the  SBK18A  Bukit Bintang MRT station on the 9 Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line.\n\n\n== Utility ==\nDistrict cooling for the entire area is provided by KLCC Cooling, which is situated in Lot 40. The cooling was done via gas-powered turbine generator. This district cooling concept is the first implementation in Malaysia.The engineer for the District Cooling Center was Flack + Kurtz (currently part of the WSP | Parsons Brinkerhoff Company).  The plant was renovated and upgraded and activated in 2015.  The current capacity is approximately 70,000 tons and has 180,000 ton hours of ice storage.  \n\n\n== See also ==\nKL Sentral - another mixed development master plan in Kuala Lumpur with emphasis on transportation\nTun Razak Exchange - master plan which focuses on financial institution in Pudu, Kuala Lumpur\nWarisan Merdeka - mixed development master plan which features a 100-story tower\nMid Valley Megamall - mixed development which features a very popular shopping mall.\nPutrajaya - fully planned city at the edge of Selangor.

        "wiki": "The Petronas Towers, also known as the Petronas Twin Towers (Malay: Menara Petronas, or Menara Berkembar Petronas), are twin skyscrapers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH)'s official definition and ranking, they were the tallest buildings in the world from 1998 to 2004, until they were surpassed by Taipei 101. The Petronas Towers remain the tallest twin towers in the world. \nThe buildings are a landmark of Kuala Lumpur, along with nearby Kuala Lumpur Tower; they remain the tallest buildings in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\nThe Petronas Towers' structural system is a tube in tube design, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan. Applying a tube-structure for extreme tall buildings is a common phenomenon.The 88-floor towers are constructed largely of reinforced concrete, with a steel and glass facade designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art, a reflection of Malaysia's Muslim religion. Another Islamic influence on the design is that the cross section of the towers is based on a Rub el Hizb, albeit with circular sectors added to meet office space requirements. The circular sectors is similar to the bottom part of the Qutub Minar.\n\nThe towers were designed by Argentine architect C\u00e9sar Pelli. A distinctive postmodern style was chosen to create a 21st-century icon for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Planning on the Petronas Towers started on 1 January 1992 and included rigorous tests and simulations of wind and structural loads on the design. Seven years of construction followed at the former site of the original Selangor Turf Club, beginning on 1 March 1993 with excavation, which involved moving 500 truckloads of earth every night to dig down 30 metres (98 ft) below the surface.\nThe construction of the superstructure commenced on 1 April 1994. Interiors with furniture were completed on 1 January 1996, the spires of Tower 1 and Tower 2 were completed on 1 March 1996, 3 years after its construction was started, and the first batch of Petronas personnel moved into the building on 1 January 1997. The building was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Malaysia's Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad on 31 August 1999. The twin towers were built on the site of Kuala Lumpur's race track. Test boreholes found that the original construction site effectively sat on the edge of a cliff. One half of the site was decayed limestone while the other half was soft rock. The entire site was moved 61 metres (200 ft) to allow the buildings to sit entirely on the soft rock. Because of the depth of the bedrock, the buildings were built on the world's deepest foundations. 104 concrete piles, ranging from 60 to 114 metres (197 to 374 ft) deep, were bored into the ground. The concrete raft foundation, comprising 13,200 cubic metres (470,000 cu ft) of concrete was continuously poured through a period of 54 hours for each tower. The raft is 4.6 metres (15 ft) thick, weighs 32,500 tonnes (35,800 tons) and held the world record for the largest concrete pour until 2007. The foundations were completed within 12 months by Bachy Soletanche and required massive amounts of concrete.As a result of the Malaysian government specifying that the buildings be completed in six years, two construction consortia were hired to meet the deadline, one for each tower. Tower 1, the west tower (left in the top-right photograph) was built by a Japanese consortium led by the Hazama Corporation (JA Jones Construction Co., MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd, Ho Hup Construction Co. Bhd and Mitsubishi Corp) while Tower 2, the east tower (right in the top-right photograph) was built by a South Korean consortium led by the Samsung C&T Corporation (Kukdong Engineering & Construction and Syarikat Jasatera Sdn Bhd).\nEarly into construction a batch of concrete failed a routine strength test causing construction to come to a complete halt. All the completed floors were tested but it was found that only one had used a bad batch and it was demolished. As a result of the concrete failure, each new batch was tested before being poured. The halt in construction had cost US$700,000 per day and led to three separate concrete plants being set up on the site to ensure that if one produced a bad batch, the other two could continue to supply concrete. The sky bridge contract was completed by Kukdong Engineering & Construction. Tower 2 (Samsung C&T) became the first to reach the world's tallest building at the time.\nDue to the huge cost of importing steel, the towers were constructed on a cheaper radical design of super high-strength reinforced concrete. High-strength concrete is a material familiar to Asian contractors and twice as effective as steel in sway reduction; however, it makes the building twice as heavy on its foundation as a comparable steel building. Supported by 23-by-23 metre concrete cores and an outer ring of widely spaced super columns, the towers use a sophisticated structural system that accommodates its slender profile and provides 560,000 square metres of column-free office space. Below the twin towers is Suria KLCC, a shopping mall, and Petronas Philharmonic Hall, the home of the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n\n=== Notable events ===\nOn 15 April 1999, Felix Baumgartner set the world record for BASE jumping (since broken) by jumping off a window cleaning crane on the Petronas Towers.\nThousands of people were evacuated on 12 September 2001 after a bomb threat the day after the September 11 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center towers in New York City. Bomb Disposal squads found no bomb in the Petronas towers but they evacuated everyone. Workers and shoppers were allowed to return three hours later, around noon. No one was hurt during the evacuation.\nOn the evening of 4 November 2005, a fire broke out in the cinema complex of the Suria KLCC shopping centre below the Petronas Towers, triggering panic among patrons. There were no reports of injuries. The buildings were largely empty, except the shopping mall, Suria KLCC, because of the late hour; the only people involved were moviegoers and some diners in restaurants.\nOn the morning of 1 September 2009, French urban climber Alain \"Spiderman\" Robert, using only his bare hands and feet and with no safety devices, scaled to the top of Tower Two in just under 2 hours after two previous efforts had ended in arrest. In his first attempt on 20 March 1997, police arrested him at the 60th floor, 28 floors away from the \"summit\". The second attempt on 20 March 2007, exactly 10 years later, was also stopped on the same floor, though on the other tower.\n\n\n== Anchor tenants ==\nTower One is fully occupied by Petronas and a number of its subsidiaries and associate companies, while the office spaces in Tower Two are mostly available for lease to other companies. A number of companies have offices in Tower Two, including SapuraOMV Upstream (Sarawak) Inc., Huawei Technologies, AVEVA, Al Jazeera English, Carigali Hess, Bloomberg, Boeing, IBM, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, McKinsey & Co, WIPRO Limited, TCS, HCL Technologies, Krawler, Microsoft, The Agency (a modelling company) and Reuters.\n\n\n== Floor plan ==\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Suria KLCC ===\n\nSuria KLCC is a 140,000 m2 (1,500,000 sq ft) upmarket retail center at the feet of the Petronas Towers. It features mostly foreign luxury goods and high-street labels. Its attractions include an art gallery, an underwater aquarium and also a Science center. Boasting approximately 300 stores, Suria KLCC is touted as one of the largest shopping malls in Malaysia. The Petronas Philharmonic Hall, also built at the base of the towers, is frequently associated with Suria KLCC's floorspace.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== KLCC Park ===\n\nSpanning 17 acres (6.9 ha) below the building is the KLCC Park with jogging and walking paths, a fountain with incorporated light show, wading pools, and a children's playground.\n\n\n=== Skybridge ===\nThe towers feature a double decker skybridge connecting the two towers on the 41st and 42nd floors, which is the highest 2-story bridge in the world. It is not attached to the main structure, but is instead designed to slide in and out of the towers to prevent it from breaking, as the towers sway several feet in towards and away from each other during high winds. It also provides some structural support to the towers in these occasions. The bridge is 170 m (558 ft) above the ground and 58.4 m (192 ft) long, weighing 750 tons. The same floor is also known as the podium, since visitors going to higher levels have to change elevators here. The skybridge is open to all visitors, but tickets are limited to about 1,000 people per day, and must be obtained on a first-come, first-served basis. Initially, the visit was free but in 2010, the tickets started being sold by Petronas. Visitors can choose to opt for package one which is just a visit to the skybridge or go for package two to go to the skybridge and all the way to level 86. Visitors are only allowed on the 41st floor as the 42nd floor can only be used by the tenants of the building.The skybridge also acts as a safety device, so that in the event of a fire or other emergency in one tower, tenants can evacuate by crossing the skybridge to the other tower. The total evacuation triggered by a bomb hoax on 12 September 2001 (the day after the September 11 attacks destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City) showed that the bridge would not be useful if both towers need to be emptied simultaneously, as the capacity of the staircases was insufficient for such an event. Plans thus call for the lifts to be used if both towers need to be evacuated, and a successful drill following the revised plan was conducted in 2005.\nThere is a two hinged arch that supports the skybridge with arch legs, each 51 metres (167 ft) long, that are bolted to level 29 of each of the towers. After being constructed on the ground, the skybridge was lifted into place on the towers over a period of three days in July 1995. Instead of being directly connected to the towers, the skybridge can shift or slide in and out of them to counterbalance any effect from the wind. Residing on the 41st and 42nd floors, the skybridge connects a conference room, an executive dining room and a prayer room.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lift system ===\nThe main bank of Lifts is located in the centre of each tower. All main lifts are double-decker with the lower deck of the lift taking passengers to even-numbered floors and upper deck to odd-numbered floors. To reach an odd-numbered floor from ground level, passengers must take an escalator to the upper deck of the lift.There are 29 double-deck passenger elevators, but there are different sets that service certain floors of the towers, specifically two sets of six of these double-deck passenger elevators to floors 1\u201323 and 1\u201337 respectively.  Another set of 5 passenger lifts transport passengers to the 41st and 42nd floors where they can switch lifts to reach the upper zones of the buildings, each double-deck passenger lift with the capacity of 52 passengers or, 26 passengers per deck. There are also 6 heavy-duty elevators for utility.\nThe lift operating chart of the Petronas Towers\n\nPL7A-PL7C (Tower 1) & PL8A-PL8C (Tower 2)(Parking & Podium Passenger Lift): P5-P1, C, G, 1, 2, 2M, 3-5 (PL7A & PL8A non-stop at level 2M)\nSL6 (Tower 1) & SL7 (Tower 2)(Parking & Podium Service Lift): P5-P1, 1, 2, 2M, 3-5 (SL7 non-stop at level 2M)\nPL14 (Tower 1) & PL15 (Tower 2)(Concert Passenger Lift): G, 2, 2M, 3, 4\nA1-A6 (Tower 1) & A7-A12 (Tower 2)(Bank A Passenger Lift): G/1, 8-23\nB1-B6 (Tower 1) & B7-B12 (Tower 2)(Bank B Passenger Lift): G/1, 23-37\nCF1-CF2 (Tower 1) & CF3-CF4 (Tower 2)(Conference Shuttle Lift): 36, 37, 40-43\nC1-C6 (Tower 1) & C7-C12 (Tower 2)(Bank C Passenger Lift): 41/42, 44-61\nD1-D3 (Tower 1) & D4-D6 (Tower 2)(Bank D Passenger Lift): 41/42, 61, 69-83\nE1-E3 (Tower 1) & E4-E6 (Tower 2)(Bank E Passenger Lift): 41/42, 61-73\nTE1-TE2 (Tower 1) & TE3-TE4 (Tower 2)(Upper Level Passenger Lift): 83, 85, 86\nSH1-SH5 (Tower 1) & SH6-SH10 (Tower 2)(Shuttle Lift): G/1, 41/42\nS1-S2 (Tower 1) & S4-S5 (Tower 2) (Service Lift): P1, C, G, 2-6, 8-38, 40-84\nS3 (Tower 1) & S6(Tower 2) (Lower Level Service Lift): P1, C, G, 2-6, 8-37\nF1-F2 (Tower 1) & F3-F4 (Tower 2) (Fireman Service Lift): P1, C, CM, G, 1-6, 8-38, 40-84, 84M1, 84M2, 85, 86 (F1 & F3 non-stop at Level 1)\n\n\n=== Service building ===\nThe service building is to the east of the Petronas Towers and contains the chiller plant system and the cooling towers to keep the Petronas Towers cool and comfortable.\n\n\n=== Ticketing system ===\nIn order to visit Petronas towers, visitors must first purchase tickets. Tickets can be purchased online or at the counter. Discounted tickets for seniors are available for those 55 years of age and above. Queues for tickets can get quite long sometimes. The complete ticketing system is provided by the Malaysian-based Longbow Technologies Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe towers are prominently featured and mentioned by name in the 1999 film Entrapment, with numerous scenes filmed at the towers, with the climax set on the skybridge. CGI was used to add slums to the bottom of the towers.\nThe Towers appear in the first episode of the US TV series 24.\nSeveral scenes of the Bollywood film Don: The Chase Begins Again were also filmed in the Petronas Towers and its skybridge.\nIn Part 1 of the Phineas and Ferb episode \"Phineas and Ferb Save Summer!\", the towers are visible during the musical number \"Summer All Over the World\".\nEidos Interactive has twice used the towers for inspiration in their video games.  In the 2002 Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, the Malaysia-based levels Basement Killing, The Graveyard Shift, and The Jacuzzi Job all take place in the Petronas Towers.  In 2010's Just Cause 2, the fictional Panau Falls Casino is based on the Petronas Towers.\nA 2002 episode of the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures titled \"When Pigs Fly\" (Season 3, Episode 6), features the towers.\nA 2002 episode of The Amazing Race 3 (\"Why Did You Have To Take Your Pants Off?\") featured the Petronas Towers as part of a task in which the competing team had to have their photograph taken in front of the towers. The towers were seen again 21 seasons later on an episode of The Amazing Race 24 (\"Smarter, Not Harder\").\nThe towers made its appearance, in the animated series Totally Spies episode titled \"Man or Machine\".\nThe opening of the 2010 film Fair Game had scenes with the twin towers along with the skyline of Kuala Lumpur.\nA number of scenes for the 2012 Hong Kong-Chinese action film Viral Factor included shots of the twin towers.\nIn the 2016 film Independence Day: Resurgence,  the towers are dropped onto the London Tower Bridge by aliens, with a character commenting: \"They like to get the landmarks\".\nIn the 2009 History Channel original program Life After People, the towers make an appearance in the episode titled \"Bound and Buried\", and it is stated that the towers would survive approximately 500 years without human maintenance, eventually collapsing from the weathering and erosion of Malaysia's tropical climate.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe Exchange 106\nList of skyscrapers\nList of tallest buildings and structures in the world\nList of tallest buildings in Kuala Lumpur\nList of tallest buildings in Malaysia\nList of tallest freestanding structures in the world\nMenara Telekom\nMerdeka PNB 118\nSkyscraper Index\nVanity height\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPetronas Towers official website\nPetronas Tower 1 on CTBUH Skyscraper Center\nPetronas Tower 2 on CTBUH Skyscraper Center\nPetronas Towers at Structurae\nIntroduction and Overview of the Petronas Towers\n Geographic data related to Petronas Towers at OpenStreetMap",
        "brit": "Petronas Twin Towers,  pair of skyscraper office buildings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that are among the world\u2019s tallest buildings. The Twin Towers, built to house the headquarters of Petronas, the national petroleum company of Malaysia, were designed by the Argentine-born American architect Cesar Pelli; they were completed in 1998. The plan for each tower is identical: an eight-lobed circular structure that contains 88 stories of occupiable space and a pyramid-shaped pinnacle surmounted by a slender steel spire. Both rise to a height of 1,483 feet (451.9 metres), which includes 242 feet (73.6 metres) for pinnacle and spire. Each building is supported by 16 large columns around its perimeter, which, along with the rest of the frame, are made of high-strength, steel-reinforced concrete rather than of structural steel; the exterior sheathing consists of stainless steel and glass. A skybridge two stories tall links the two towers between the 41st and 42nd stories.Petronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates.J. Apicella/Cesar Pelli & AssociatesIn 1996, after the spires had been attached to the buildings (and each had thus reached its full height), the Petronas Twin Towers were declared the world\u2019s tallest buildings, eclipsing the former record holder, the 110-story Sears (now Willis) Tower in Chicago. The roof of the Sears Tower was actually more than 200 feet (60 metres) higher than those of the Twin Towers, but the spires on the towers\u2019 pinnacles were regarded as  integral parts of the overall architectural structure (see Researcher\u2019s Note: Heights of buildings). The Twin Towers, in turn, lost their preeminent status in 2003 after a spire was put in place atop the Taipei 101 (Taipei Financial Center) building, in Taipei, Taiwan, and that structure reached a height of 1,667 feet (508 metres).

          "We got dropped off by our taxi driver here and spent about an hour, the twin towers are a handsome structure. We took pictures from the front then walked through at ground level with time being restricted as only here for the day we went up the nearby kL tower with great views",
          "Went here few times in a year. It was a great place in KL to visit especially during special occasion such as new year celebration.",
          "A must visit if you are in KL Pre book online for a time slot and its pot luck if the weather is poor on your time slot as it was when we visited . Check in point a little hard to find in the basement of the complex. The tour could be so much better if the accompanying guide who",
          "Well worth a visit to the towers. Went up an 19:30 and saw Kuala Lumpa light up at night. Only advice I can give you is pre-book your tickets before you travel as on the day only a certain amount of tickts are available",
          "Fantastic day here. What a great view alas it will be smaller than the new building they are doing. Staff were good giving your a story of the towers and then time to yourself.",
          "Very interesting and again staff all helpful very informative we found it best to book with them direct. Photos can be expensive if they take them but we purchased a pic in a fridge magnet. Really clean and super views over the city",
          "We went up the towers at 5pm and was a brilliant experience. Staff friendly and knowledgeable. Didn't feel rushed while there",
          "Leisure shopping for local art and artisan work. Cute cafes for lazy conversations, leisure bargains and local food",
          "Well worth a visit. Not rushed but also informative. Great views, small group numbers. Nice shop. Number 1 attraction in Kuala Lumpur. Better signs needed to find entrance.",
          "Excellent tour of this iconic building. Dizzying views of the city. We visited at night and decided it was one of the highlights of our holiday. Very friendly and knowledgeable guides.",
          "Would have been far more impressive before all the other skyscrapers surrounded it. It's also enclosed unlike many others where the viewing decks are either open or have glass floors. The one thing in its favour is the shopping mall and restaurants which make up the lower",
          "We booked a connecting flight via malaysia to macau and we have 11 hours lay over so me and my friends decided to have a quick tour in KL. We visited petronas twin tower. It took us more than an hour from the airport via grab that cost us 130myr. I must say it\u2019s worth a visit. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "We didn\u2019t book in advance but managed to get tickets straight away- we went early February. You have to wait for a while to go up the lifts with a guide. The lifts are super fast but you can hardly feel any movement. We were given about 15 minutes on the glass enclosed bridge",
          "We booked in advance the skip the line tickets so we\u2019re up first. It did feel like everyone was just getting hearded in. Photos are very expensive from there booth and felt there was a lot of standing about waiting for other people in the group.",
          "Visited on a pre booked your very quick admission and even though the towers were busy the whole process was smooth and efficient x The only thing that spoilt our visit was the sellers outside trying to sell us lenses for our phones, very intimidating and did not take no for an",
          "love the twin tower, with nice mall & park. its remind me to the New York Park. the water fountain was the highlight for us to stay longer",
          "Great to see towers from the outside! Amazing building. Went up to bridge and viewing deck, quite average, not much to see without this great looking building being in view. Glad I\u2019ve done it but not sure it\u2019s worth the money to take the trip out there. Definitely recommend",
          "I visited the Petronas Towers during February. Booked 1 month a-head of visit day (even with the COVID-19 in February, not all time slots were available for visit on the same day). We first are taken to the 41st floor to the skybridge for 20 min. Then, up to the 86th floor for",
          "I booked my time at the service counter at the towers - they asked if I qualified for the senior discount so it was half price. I found we had enough time at both the skybridge and the top to get the good views.",
          "I really enjoyed the tour here; the staff were very helpful and answered any questions you had as well as shared some really cool architectural facts about the building. You get to walk across the sky bridge and spend about 15 minutes admiring the view. You also go up to the",
          "We found the views nice and the bridge fun. It felt very safe and we were in a small group so that we could all take our desired pictures.",
          "Get your tickets in advance, you can do it on TA and they deliver to your hotel. Sunset tours are best. They organise in small groups that go up and get 10 mins on the sky bridge for photos and then up to the 86th floor where you get a 360 view. Something you do once. Was not",
          "One of the wonderful buildings of the city of KL, located in the heart of the city , nice place of shopping and they have a nice library for books lovers I used to spend hours there reading books. The food was great in the foodcourt. and mainly surrounding by a park. From the",
          "This was a very organised trip they did it in groups was amazing and so beautiful view. We did it in the day but must be amazing at night. Must do trip. They do take your temperature as you go in and if you have high temperature they won\u2019t let you go in. No ruck sacks allowed",
          "Must do if in kl. we got oldies discount by visiting the evening before our intended visit. It\u2019s a bit of a white elephant really. They\u2019d have been better spending the money on conserving wild places which is a thing much neglected in Malaysia",
          "obviously it's a must go place. absolutely worth visiting. now it has more stuff to Instagram. very busy and nice place",
          "Book in advance. Don\u2019t be early or late, they won\u2019t let you in. Small groups are timed to go to different stages and you get between 15-20 minutes at each one, including the sky bridge. Fantastic views all around. Great shopping mall below and lovely park at the back of the",
          "We booked in advance through the Internet for our Petronas towers visit, which avoided the need for any queuing. In fact, as you enter the enormous shopping mall, you go to the right, then down an escalator to start the tour. It takes you straight up to the Sky bridge where you",
          "Malaysia's Centre of tourist attraction. The Twin Tower is Icon of the world. Excellent place to soend time for family & business meetings.",
          "What a majectic view of this skyline. It it certainly iconic! Plus the fact that you could go shopping luxury brands!",
          "The shopping mall and park is still nice 20 years after opening. Lively and both local food and international brands and clean. I cannot understand who in their right mind would pay to go up in the towers. They are number 19th and a family would have to pay 50USD to get up.",
          "The tallest twin tower in world. Never bored of looking at this everyday. You can take pictures of the twin towers but I suggest going in the evening around 7pm to 8pm so that you to see the petronas twin towers during the day and how amazing it looks like after sunset. You can",
          "Honestly, this was probably the most waste of time ever. People fighting and jumping over each other to get a picture at the end of the water fountain. We just took a few pictures with wide angle lens the locals were forcing us to buy. Up the security here.",
          "Kuala Lumpur is a very nice City with many monuments to visit. For shopping many malls!!!!Nice art gallery. Easy to use sky train. A lot of citizens speak English and are good with the tourists",
          "The sky tour is the best, you get a view of the whole of Kuala Lumpur and it's not too expensive to see.",
          "Great view but don't come in hot day afternoon. But it good view in night. Don't forget to bring your wide lens camera",
          "The views over the city from the 41st floor skybridge are amazing, The documentary that you watch before your visit is very informative. There is a souvenir shop where you can buy plenty of remiders of your visit. You must also vist the shopping mall, you name the top designer",
          "We were enjoyed to view at sky deck. It was amazing. Wow! But only 1 negative which is a speaker talked and we didn't understand as we are deaf. So we decided to give them a suggestion on feedback form and told them that they could provide deaf people written documents or",
          "This is just a must see and do when in KL - it is the landmark building and unique to the world. The bridge has as interesting fact (which I will not spoil) Book in advance of the day you are going - we booked the day before and got the 9.15am slot. Very good attraction !",
          "Simply a great building, easy and speedy access. Suggest you book online before you travel Good views all around and a few souvenirs to buy if you so require.",
          "Fabulous building inside and out. Did the tour, well worth it with fabulous views in every direction.",
          "What wonderful views. There was no queue and the staff were very polite and knowledgeable. We stopped on two floors to see the views. The sky bridge was superb and on the top floor you could see all around. Thank yiu",
          "went to the topdeck and the skybridge. Fantastic view of the city with good photo opportunities. Recommended",
          "Petronas towers and the surrounding area is a destination trip on its own. Especially a tasting destination.",
          "Always love visiting this place. The views over kl are amazing on a clear day. The lifts seem to take ages to get to the top so you know your going high up, and the information displays are very well done.",
          "Incredible sight at night. The place is magnificent with the theatre for the philharmonic inside the 6 story mall. It\u2019s an architectural work of art.",
          "The trip takes about an hour visiting both the bridge and the top. Impressive building with a nice view",
          "I was happy to be able to travel to attempt to see the towers from the inside and the bridge. Unfortunately I was there on a Monday, when it was close. In overall it's a very interesting and beautiful structure to see.",
          "We visited at a busy time, so booking ahead of time is recommended to avoid disappointment. When we got to KL we managed to book our tickets for 10 days later. Not a cheap experience but definitely worth the money. Very organised and efficient, the visit allows plenty of time on",
          "We went one evening and again in the morning a few days later. Great spot for some memory pictures, plenty of hawkers selling wide angle smart phone lenses to help capture the whole building...will also help you take the picture. Was offered a few other items for sale - so",
          "This building was a proud for us. There are lot of people's coming here to visit this place all over the world. Most favourite place in KL for me.",
          "- Great experience - Goods views - Easy to buy tickets from the lobby - Nasty toilet in higher floor - Aircon was quite strong so I recommed to take a blouser",
          "Wow! Great experience here! Come and absorb the atmosphere here. Standing between the two megastructures really gives you a new perspective on life. That the priceless experience you don't want to miss.",

          "For anyone that likes shopping it is perfect. We went to the top of the towers what a view you can see for miles. It is not too expensive anyone visiting the towers should go to the top. also walk across the bridge. Don't forget your camera you can get some beautiful pictures of",
          "The symbol of the capital city Kuala Lumpur. The tallest twin towers of the world. So amazing. You should see.",
          "Well with a visit, take a trip up the towers and get a great view of Kuala Lumpur, if your in to construction it\u2019s a must",
          "The tour was good. Efficient with only a little too much time in their gift shop but not bad. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to do something touristy in KL.",
          "A must, always providing you can stand heights. Two stops. One on the bridge at level 41 and the other at the observation floor at level 86. Spectacular views of K.L. Go for it. Currently 80MYR or, if like me you are over sixty one, 42. You need your passport to book tickets to",
          "Having watched mega structures on NGC years ago, Petronas twin towers became a must see for me. Its worth it. Full view photos of the twin towers are possible from the park side and you don't need a zoom enhancer. Those who love shopping can enjoy doing so at the mall with all",
          "A tribute to the architect and the developer for iconic building. With a variety of shops below to muse in. The sky bridge is still one of the best visual photographed buildings in KL.",
          "Well worth a visit to the bridge and then to the top of the tower. Well organised and efficient. Good guides. Try and get a time slot around sunset for the best views.",
          "Must see if you visit Kuala Lumpa. The towers offer an amazing view of this city from the viewing bridge & then on up to the top viewing level. When I visited there was little or no queue, time slots are well managed by the staff who are attentive & friendly.",
          "This is still the tallest twin tower in the world and is a magnificent and comanding structure. It is more beautiful in the night.",
          "I do not enjoy heights, but this is a must. The views are amazing. There is also a night symphony fountain show, this runs 3 times a night. A must see, the towers at night are an awesome sight. There are plenty of shops in the mall here and some good restaurants.",
          "The Petronas Twin Towers is a must go if you're in KL. There are many things to do and look while you're there, you could easily spend the whole day browsing. It's a very clean and safe place to go as a couple or to take your family.",
          "We were part of a cruise ship excursion and sadly by the time we got here there was too big a queue for us to ascend the towers. My advice is book on advance or dont go on the ship trip, do it yourself. OK they look great and the best place for a photo is at the shopping centre",
          "Wonderful views over the city. Although a guide tour you do have enough time on the bridge and the viewing platform.",
          "Very nice location and an overall good setup. The travel to the location needed us to move out of the shopping districts, but still, it was filled with the heavy inflow of tourists.",
          "Absolutely loved the views from the top of the tower and the bridge. We were given enough time to take photos. We were also lucky enough to see the window cleaners doing a very brave job!",
          "Mind Blowing - it is just impressive to stand in front of them. The viw from the top deck is fantastic",
          "Huge! Amazing photos to be taken near and all around the amazing maintained grounds. Security and police located everywhere.",
          "It was great to walk in the area Valentin's night . Everybody was very happy and feeling great. With my friends joking and having an excelent time. Nice day beautifull place.",
          "Spectacular especially at night. it is probably the most important landmark in KL. What is extremely annoying are the people who try to sell wide lens for your mobile phone. It is crowded every night, but amazing to look at.",
          "10 minute walk from our hotel, all on the level. Book to visit the Towers at 7:15pm, forgot to print both tickets, not an issue staff went away and printed second ticket for us. Great service from all staff at all levels of the twin towers. Great views of KL, downside you could",
          "This building is definitely something to behold and not just the outside. If you visit be sure to go up to the sky walkway and top floor for spectacular city views. I\u2019d recommend purchasing tickets directly from the Petronas Towers website to visit the skywalk and top floor.",
          "A lot of waiting to be there at the designated time and then they badge you into groups and some people kept trying to jump into the earlier group. Animated video on safety then they put you in a lift. I am sure they meet the regulations but we all know when a lift says 13 max",
          "This is like bucket list. just need to cross it. I like the mall Suria KLCC better than to see the tower. For photospot, better to opt the bridge near park compared to the other spot in the front of the tower. Observation deck is rather pricey, so didn't go up there. maybe next",
          "Shopping shopping shopping shopping shopping and maybe go upstairs for the view, but it\u2019ll cost you and it\u2019s not really worth it bc the towers seem better to look AT than to look FROM. To each their own tho. More fun if you actually like to shop (I don\u2019t).",
          "On the journey to the top you can stop to the pasarelle and observation deck.great view of the city, intreresting info by the tower guide",
          "So I\u2019ve done a fair amount of tower attraction visits and this one wins the award for \u2018Let\u2019s herd customers round like Sheep\u2019. Right from admission we were given coloured stickers, and throughout the visit you\u2019ll be given 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there before being called on",
          "Lovely views but spoilt by being ushered like sheep and having to stick to the management\u2019s strict timescale for each area. Not allowed to leave earlier. I may be wrong, but it seemed that we were given the most time in the upper gift shop..... If given the choice, I\u2019d have only",
          "Go at night, the experience is World Class, we didn\u2019t go up the Towers but we just marvelled at their lit up beauty! Visit these Towers 100%",
          "I was impressed by the structure of the visit. Everything went well and each group was a manageable size, and enough time was allowed at each point to enjoy the views and take pics.",
          "Absolutely amazing view, and the walkway between the towers is stunning. A must do if in KL. The lifts are probably the fastest I have ever been in.",
          "before we went I read that it wasn't always necessary to book tickets in advance and you could normally book them on the day especially as they give half price concessions (however these cannot be booked on line and need to be done on site) Word of warning the tours consist of",
          "We bought the tickets online to go up on the towers, we paid MYR 85 per person and it was really worth it. The view from the top is really nice and the sky bridge is a little scary :) Shopping center between the towers is really good and full of original brand store, there is a",
          "No queues, only 40 minute wait to enter. I like that groups were small so you can really enjoy the view and place!",
          "This is an iconic modern monument that is awe inspiring for its sheer size and architecture- made of muti layered, patterned glimmering metal it is quite a spectacle either at daylight or night. The place also has a very casual touristy vibe and is great for a evening stroll",
          "Breathtaking twin towers that rule the skies of KL... best view from KLCC park where you can also catch the water & light show.",
          "Very convenient as it is located above the mall Syria KLCC. It has a lot of amazing options when comes to F&B. It is also easily accessible via public transport.",
          "Absolute amazing view. At night everything is lit up and in the surrounding area there is a park where one can just relax and watch the fountain display",
          "While it is fairly time limited and hard to get tickets, this is a must see when visiting KL. Stunning views from the Towers and amazing history.",
          "In the heart of Kuala Lumpur that is shining and outstanding among other towers. No matter how many picture you can take, yet want to take more from different angles. Shopping mall inside good to visit.",
          "We went to Kuala Lumpur at the end of our honeymoon and we stayed opposite the towers at the Mandarin Oriental and had views of the towers from our room which was amazing. We still wanted to go up the Petronas twin towers though as we knew the views would be fantastic. We tried",
          "This must see area at night at 7:00 pm on the back of the tower. Awesome light water show with orchestra! You will get some fabulous photos during the show... and it is free!",
          "A must visit when in KL. Staffs were so nice. A good walk around area as well. We also went shopping near by.",
          "An incredible building. Worth the trip to KL alone just to look at. Daytime or night time you just can't get enough of this impressive building.",
          "Bought tickets in the morning for 7 15 pm , it was nice to watch sunset creeping and lights coming on .KL tower lights kept changing ,a delight to watch.",
          "I have been there twice. And the first time it was strong impressive. My advice - get up to the Menara tower to view the Petronas Twin Towers. It much better to look \"from the side\". Espe\u0441ially at sunset.",
          "The view is great, nice hidden park in the middle of the city, green jogging track and best landscape.",
          "Honestly a waste of money and very disorganized. Not much information is given. You just go up using a lift and wonder around on top until the next lift down. Even worse there is a camera that takes pics that you still need to pay an arm and a leg for. Not worth the price at",
          "OK, so you want to go up the Petronas towers? Here's my advice....it's closed on Monday's (odd for a major tourist attraction), need to buy tickets at least 48 hours in advance and be patient with their ticketing website. If you fail to get a slot, just go to the KL tower and",
          "We attended the towers the day before to uplift tickets for a time slot that suited our plans. On the day of our visit the staff were very efficient in moving us up the tower. The views from the top were worth the visit.",
          "Celebrates my siater birthday ans we had a lot of fun at Twin Tower. A lot of restaurants options and shops. Shop till you drop!",
          "Ticket fairly expensive by Malaysian standards but worth it. Excellent views and the ticket includes the skybridge as well.",
          "We visited the petronas as part of our honeymoon trip. We found the organisation of the staff to be spot on, and the general facility was very clean and nice. The view from the top was spectacular. The only complaint was that due to the number of guests there is a limit on how",
          "Wonderful experience in kuala lumpur. I had a good memories with my friends, maybe I should bring my parents along.",
          "We went there and saw the buildings and inside shopping centre. Good to be there but preferred to walk outside in the green park.",
          "perfect destination to enjoy different cultures, stlye of life, all Asia in one place. very clean, nice people, worth to see and be there",
          "The tour is super organized but that makes it a bit long - you queue up and go to the skywalk floor where you have a set amount of time (perhaps a bit too much). Then you meet your group and head up to the top; again, maybe too much time. Cool note; you can actually see the gold",
          "On the day we went up the weather was not the best rain and misty, ij but all the same was a very good experience, it is well organized in groups and the guides are really helpful even take photos of you together. Merc",
          "Watching the Sunset at the Petronas was breathtaking. Very magical and something that I feel grateful about!",
          "Ideally you should book online to avoid lengthy queues. Very reasonable prices compared to tall buildings throughout the world. Great views",
          "We went at night to see the city lights but unfortunately it was raining heavily while we were in the sky bridge on the 41st floor. Luckily it let up quite a bit when we got to the top. But even with the rain it was amazing. We got some great pictures of the other tower that",
          "We had pre-booked tickets for the visit. We got discount for senior citizen while booking the tickets (we had to submit the age proof like scanned copy of passport while booking). Tickets were delivered at our hotel. Visit was well organized. Thankfully there were not too many",
          "I've wanted to revisit the towers after coming over 5 years ago. My friends an d went around 20:30, and the views at night were amazing. The staff were helpful and polite at all times.",
          "The ability to see a panoramic view of the city was amazing. I wish there was a glass bridge to walk across but other than that it was amazing!",
          "I have seriously fallen head over heals for the Petronas Towers! They are gorgeous and gleaming during the day. At night they look like beautiful glowing crystal jewel boxes! Nothing I read or saw prior to landing in KL prepared me for this stunning artistic structure!",
          "Got a ticket for 6:15pm and was rushed through. Only 15 minutes at the top. ;-( For the time we had we the views were great.",
          "I come to the area around KLCC at least once a week, and always go around the twin towers to destress. I don't know why but it's always nice here. I have always liked coming from Bukit Bintang, walking the walkway, past KLCC Park and coming across the towers. The sights never",
          "Worth the visit. Great views outside and inside. Buy tour ticket day before (even then it\u00b4s hard to say which weather conditions there will be).",
          "Amazing manmade towers. Famous place for phototaking. Suggestions : should sell drinks n snacks to provide better sitting place n opportunity for revenue",
          "I thought that the trip up the towers was well-organised and that all the staff were helpful and friendly. I advise booking in advance. The view from the top is interesting and there is good information about the towers. My only gripe is that we had to wait quite a long time to",
          "I\u2019m not normally a fan of going up iconic high buildings such as the Empire State Building as there seems no point as the view is the building itself and not it\u2019s surroundings. However I made an exception in the case of the Petronus Towers as I wanted to walk the sky bridge",
          "We had the chance to visit Petronas towers during our stop over going to Thailand. The train is amazing as well as the ease of travel. The tower is loaded with restaurants, shops and amazing views! Worth the effort",
          "It's about \u00a313 pp to go up to the bridge which joins the 2 towers. It was interesting and you have plenty of time to look around on each level (3 in all) and take photos. The tour is about an hour up top. If you don't want to go up you can still go into the foyer area and",
          "One of the must see places in Kuala Lumpur. The view of the buildings were more impressive during the night when it was illuminated. Too bad it was closed when we were there.",
          "A must visit place. Very hygenic and clean, staff was friendly and ppace looked very appealing, tourist friendly.",
          "What a glimpse of heavenlies, skies and picturesque! This was an amazing tour of my life. I have never had such majestic views for a long time. What an indulgence!",
          "The Petronas Tower are the main landmark of the city, everything is built around them, the most expensive hotel rooms have views on them and they're the main thing that you'll want to take a picture of. But the tour experience is rather disappointing. You won't learn much about",
          "We didn\u2019t ore book tickets so just went along at 9:45 midweek. There was no que and they had quite a bit of availability we got tickets for 10:30. It\u2019s very well organised with everyone in coloured groups with limited time in each section. Was good for us but I think some people",
          "From our location City centre it was a mere 4 stops to the Towers on the LRT at a cost of 2.10 MR (39 pence). Taking about 15 mins it was the hi light of our stopover. Had to wait a couple of hours from purchase to entering so best plan would be to prebook it. Amazing views",
          "The towers are great to see and very pretty at night. My one tip would be book tickets in advance. We arrived at 15:00hrs and could not get up there until 20:00hrs",
          "At night the towers are really an overwhelming sight, especially after having dinner accompanied by 7 cocktails at Nadodi restaurant.",
          "This is a nice place but the guides sales are not to be trusted.people are nice and transportation facility is superb.",
          "The tower and the views are fantastic. I think the organisers have to do this but you are herded like sheep. The longest stop is in the shop on the way down on the 76th floor and you can't just leave. Left a bit of a bad taste at the end, unfortunately. Still worth",
          "Prebook your tickets it you want to go up to the observation deck. it can be hard to get all the towers in your photos, there are heaps of people selling the lenses to put on your cellphone",
          "Popular attraction with tourists. RM 80 for nonresidents. RM 41 for seniors. Much lower price for residents. Buy tickets ahead to avoid disappointment. A safety video is shown before admission. First stop is 41st for to the bridge connecting the towers. Bridge has two levels.",
          "This elegant structure rises above the skyscrapers alongside like a two legged giant - great photo opportunities from all angles especially KLCC Park - visiting proved a problem - we tried to book on line as soon as we arrived in KL - to late she cried - there was only one spot",
          "We booked online this visit. At the entrance the security staff helped us to find the way to the counter \"-1-st\" \"level\". You show your reservation and get a 'badge' with the same color, like others in your group. The staff is smiling and helpful to inform you on details. You",
          "Visited the Petronas tower at level 41 and 86. It was quite well conducted tour by the staff there. The view from the 86th level is magnificent. However, the ticket price is quite high considering there is simple visit only and nothing sort of souvenir is provided despite such",
          "Petronas tower is the iconic building of Malaysia and one of the most popular building I have visited the place and it was just marvellous",
          "This iconic tower of Malaysia is amazing when I saw this building I coudn't believed it that is too much beautiful than any other buildings. This tower is like a made of stainless steel, rain or shine it's always in sunshine. Morning, and evening it's always twinkling because of",

          "Scenic view of the tall twin towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Lots of shops to go by in the massive mall inside.",
          "Nice unique tower and worth taking pictures from outside. Don\u2019t waste going inside to walk on the connecting bridge unless you absolutely wish to do so. You will waste Atleast 2-3 hours waiting in the queue",
          "This tour was quite long for the total of 10-15 minutes you get at the floors for the pictures. You visit 3 or 4 floors to see various levels of the towers, but I enjoyed the view from outside at the park more than inside the tower. It's quite organized, though! We had to beg to",
          "There is a mall inside the towers. Suria mall. In the kl park side everyday there are 3 light shows..8, 9 and 10 pm. If you want to go to the top of towers you should buy to tickets which are very difficult to get over the counter. Highly recommended to but it online.",
          "We booked our tickets from the UK on the Petronas Twin Towers website, which made obtaining the tickets very easy indeed. First stop on the lift was the Sky Bridge at Level 41, where you get about 10 minutes to take photos of the stunning views of Kuala Lumpur. Then on to Level",
          "One of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had! Beautiful, beautiful construction! I\u2019d love to go back someday!",
          "Traveled across town, got there took one look, and said what a waste of time. It\u2019s a building with a mall in the basement, nothing more. Might have been something special when it was new and shiny, but now it\u2019s just dull and grimy.",
          "Excellent visit, ordered tickets off the net and all worked well. Timed entries for about 30 people every 30 mins and works great. You are shepherded about a bit but all well done. Views are excellent from the bridge and the higher floor. Inevitable gift shops, you get two this",
          "Great building in Malaysia and super great spot in the middle of the city. Beside the tower has a huge park to relax and take great photo there.",
          "My first visit KL and came here for the landmark. It's so nice and beautiful tower if you come KL don't miss to see this item. Easy to come near by KLCC station and the people in Malaysia so friendly and nice. That not surprise why I love Malaysia and Malaysian people. I will",

          "it is good one but no so attractive. we watched it from distance and enlighted to know that it is built by an indian.",
          "There a few issues with this tour: - firstly, there\u2019s no 360 degree view - KL in itself does not have a great skyline so if you add smog along with it, it doesn\u2019t add to a breathtaking view. - you are only allowed a short period time at the tower bridge (10mins) and the 86 floor",
          "This is a must see in Kuala Lumpur...,very impressive architecture, This tower is so beautiful. Our guide was excellent and we found the tour interesting. Great place to see.",
          "If you visit Kuala Lumpur this is a must do on tour list. Well organised, given 10mins on bridge which was plenty. Guided in colour groups to ensure not too crowded",
          "Great place to visit. You can take plenty of pictures outside and you can also get wide angle lens accessory outside to add to your mobile camera lens to help you get full picture of towers. Inside the mall there are plenty food and shopping options.",
          "Please check out our other reviews to see we always leave an honest opinion. We booked our tickets on line a week ago and there was loads of availability but we decided early in the morning. Arrived at 8-40 for our 9am slot. You can only take phones camera, wallet with you.",
          "This famous twin towers is once the highest in the world. Make sure to make a reservation, if you want to go up at sunset. Staff very professional and a lot of tourists from other Muslim countries enjoying city life. KL is a very safe place. In a way, Petronas and KLCC",

          "Went there for sunset. it was beautiful, to see the transition from day to night and watch the city to start lighting up.",
          "Worth the time to check out. An amazing structure all stainless steel and glass. Walkway on 34 flr with the observation deck on 86 flr. Views are stunning. A tip pre-book, very limited time slots available and get booked very quickly",

          "Absolutely incredible to see these iconic skyscrapers in person! It was much easier to get up to the top than I was expecting. I think it cost about $12 US but absolutely worth it. You get a little history of the towers and other high-rise is going up in Kuala Lumpur. One of the",
          "We booked well in advance for this visit but we were disappointed at the lack of verbal presentations there was. This a magnificent building and a must-do in KL but the visit managers should review the content.",
          "It wouldn't be a visit to Kuala Lumpur for our Canadian friends without taking them to see this iconic building that seems to be the heart of the city. We had booked advance tickets on line. While waiting in line to board the elevator, coloured landyards will be given out to",

          "The iconic International view of Kuala Lumpur. But that is about it. Maybe try to get a different angle for your photo",
          "The best icon of KL. An excellent instagram spot. You will find a a lot of people standing there for selling the wide zoom lense for taking the pix. a great place for one time visit only.",
          "We enjoyed our trip to the Towers. We went with friends who have toured many of the tallest buildings in the world. They rate the Petronas Towers the best experience. The staff was friendly and knowledge and made the entire trip enjoyable. I recommend you get tickets online",
          "The most recognized symbol of the city. Impressive just to look at, but really just another set of skyscrapers.",
          "The view is great but it\u2019s a little expensive. It\u2019s nice to just walk around the lobby area with all the other tourists if you don\u2019t want to take a ride and see the view. Also it\u2019s often booked out 2-3 days ahead during peak times like Christmas and New Year.",
          "This was the tallest building till 2004 and they remain the tallest twin tower in the world.This is the landmark of Kuala Lumpur. You can see the towers from almost all the places in the city.This has 88 floors, however tourists are allowed till 48 floor if you have purchased",
          "We made our visit here to the Petronas Twin Towers Kuala Lumpur. From where we were staying it cost us about 12 MYR in a Grab taxi. It is advisable to book your tickets online to ensure that you get the time slot that you want. The price online and on the day is the same which",
          "The towers are so impressive from the grounds you need to do the observation deck. I would suggest booking online for tickets first. The tour was about 45 mins which is more than enough time to get all the photos you want.",
          "Conveniently located in the heart of KL city. Easily reachable from anywhere in KL by trains. Don't drive here as parking and traffic both can be a huge hassle. While you are here, be sure to take a stroll around KLCC park.",
          "You must book this visit in advance as they strictly manage the number of people that go up. After you've checked bags, you're ushered into an elevator to the skywalk floor. after 10 minutes, it's back to the elevator to the top. note that this requires two elevators. the view",
          "Use to be the tallest building in the world ,till they built one that went beyon the clouds in Bubai . Still its well worth the visit to see this metal structure gleeming in the sun and when you get up high you just do not want to look down you just wonder how they managed to",
          "A must if you go to Kuala Lumpur. The view from outside (we didn't even go inside, cause we previously went to another tower), left us amazed.",
          "The Petronas Twin Towers is one of the tallest skyscrapers in the Asia. Designed by Cesar Pelli, it is based on geometric Islamic designs. The twin towers are joined mid-way by a 2 level skybridge that are open to visitors. At its base is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra",
          "not many words are needed. This is a must see in Kuala Lumpur....very impressive architecture with a nice garden in the front !",
          "Amazing views from the top of the towers. Make sure to book at least a day before. More often than not tickets are sold out. For 45 mins exploring the top it will cost RM80. Booking through klook and get your guide may be more expensive. We bought directly at the ticket office",
          "We walked through the air condition bridge from our apartment to Petronas towers. There's a little park before approaching. Very pleasant and they also a huge shopping centre. Had a nice time",
          "This was one of the best experience i had in Malaysia. The tower is so beautiful and we had an inside tour which took us right at the top. The view from 154 floor was amazing.",
          "The highlight was the skybridge between the towers. The very top was good and the floor is tilted at a weird angle so if you have vertigo be aware.. But great photos",
          "We purchased our tickets direct a few days before we wanted to go and would recommend tickets are pre-purchased. You are able to select the time you want if it's available. Tickets at the time were MYR 80. We chose 7pm as we had seen the views during the day going up KL",
          "No matter how many times you visit this iconic tower, you'll be mesmerized each and every time. Stunning and beautiful as ever.",
          "Shopping while enjoying beautiful scenery of a park with water fountains. Great food and you can enjoy a good run around the park as well.",
          "This is a business only building, so closes at 6PM every night. You MUST get a booked ticket, it is highly unlikely you could visit by just turning up. Try to book a morning / early afternoon visit, by 3.30-4 PM the smog is rolling across the city cutting the views you get, and",
          "What's a visit to KL without experiencing the iconic Petronas Towers? They're beautiful structures, especially when all lit up a night. Schedule your tour around sunset / dusk time if possible.",
          "Man made marvel, worth the wait to see the views from the top. First from the bridge then the top floor. If you are in KL for a few days and plan to go to see the tower buy your tickets before hand to avoid disappointment.",
          "Still cannot understand why this is such an attraction. It is two very tall buildings. The mall inside the towers does have lots of high-end shops (Gucci) and more \"middle\" like Body Shop. So if you want to shop, you can do so. But really it is just a photo op.",
          "amazing construction. great view of Kuala lumpur city from the top of the towers. fast escalators and well maintained",
          "Enjoyed our visit to the Petronas Twin Towers. Our guide was excellent and we found the tour interesting. Only comment would be it would be nicer if we could have some free time at the end to go back to bits if we wanted to.",
          "We thought we could just buy tickets and go up, as what we just did 3 months ago at Taipei 101 Tower. But alas, we arrived at noon and was told tickets were sold out for the day! Looks like if you are serious about going up here, you either need to pre-book or come very early.",
          "Seeing these former tallest buildings in the world was better than expected. In the morning time, the sun shines on the front side making them so brilliant and shiny. They're beauties.",
          "Beautiful buildings to visit for a stunning photo op. we did not do the bridge or viewing deck due to price, did KL Towers instead. However i can definitely say that the buildings are worth a visit as they are breathtaking and we did the musical fountains as well which were",
          "Many people said it was just a building, but for me it was the sign of great country. It is better for u to take the sky bridge. It was worthed (price 80 Rm) u will go to level 41 and 86. U will see a great view of KL. Worthed",
          "If you want to see how far Kuala Lumpur stretches, then the Petronas Twin Towers Skywalk is the way to go, though I prefer the KL Tower. The only problem with the Skywalk is that, after the Malaysian government rips off foreigners with a daily hotel room tax, you're forking out",
          "Kid enjoyed a lot the twin towers view and night show. 31 night we spent there. This location was very near from our hotel, so we had chances to come frequently here. Great place to see.",
          "We booked to do the Skybridge, not knowing that part of the tour took you to the top of the towers for a view from the 86th floor. It was wonderful and a great surprise. Highly highly recommended - and a very well organised tour.",
          "I only had a brief visit, even I did not enter the building. If you only want to take photos with the towers behind you, you should go to KLCC Park, just behind Suria KLCC mall. Go to the bridge there and voila, it's quite nice to take photo there.",
          "Whilst there are now taller buildings around the twin towers still command respect and awe with attention to detail- could be more than 20 years old ( featured in the movie Entrapment) it a photographic heaven at night with a shopping mall on the lower levels A must do in KL",
          "Petronas Towers is the tallest twin tower in the world, and from 1998 to 2004 it was the tallest building in the world, so it's a must visit if in Kuala Lumpur, that's for sure. We booked a tour in advance, and that is advisable. We arrived early for our tour, and were let in",
          "Better than KL TOWER shorter trip but well worth it for the info and views. Informative staff shame Lewis Hamilton not around for a few selfies\ud83e\udd23",
          "This is the iconic place in KL. If you are staying in Bukit Bintang, you can easily reach the Pavilion shopping mall at Bukit Bintang and then there's a walking path from there to KLCC which takes around 10 minutes to walk. You can walk out from the KLCC and see these two",
          "Am Icon that represents Malaysia. Beautiful architecture and share is adopted based on an Islamic geometrical shape.",
          "Very beautifully built towers. If you go in the late night, you can appreciate the towers with their lights on. Lots of shops nearby to have a bite or grab a full meal. If you are in Kuala Lumpur then it is must visit.",
          "I was planning this visit for a loooong time and finally been there. It was magical. Better to visit at night. be prepared for unexpected rain. A lot of lens sellers over there for your phones. there is a tour fee for the bridge between the towers but it is free entry",
          "Once you reach KL you will have a glimpse of the Twin Towers from literary everwhere but you have see it up close to realize what an architectural brilliance it is. Its like a god's creation. Go to the park through the Jalan Ampang entrance to get the best view.",
          "Booked solid we couldn't go up,our own fault for not planning earlier but left if to last day. Good place to combine shopping with the tower though",
          "Beautiful and well worth the visit. We also went to canopy lounge to have drinks and shish and you can see he towers from there as you are sitting in a rooftop bar",
          "This is my second visit after 12 years. The shopping area is still great to shop. Outside, we have a great time photo taking.",
          "its natural that most people will go up the towers ,whilst here,but as a building it offers little .shopping malls could be any place in the world .eating at the food places not at all memorable. suspect the religous police in this area of the world have over sanitised much",
          "The Petronis Twin Towers is an iconic landmark of Kuala Lumpur, the tallest twin towers in the world. There is a paid tour which takes you to the 41st, 86th and 83rd floors for viewing the city sprawling below. A wonder of wonders one cannot miss visiting.",
          "Petronas is the highest twin tower in the world. Visitors are so well managed and the view from 84th floor is awe inspiring. There is shopping plaza and a park with lake (symphoni) where one can sit and relax. There is a tunnel connecting tower with Pavilion and Berjaya Time",
          "We were unable to buy tickets to go up the tower that we had to be content in just souvenir shots of the twin towers in the background. My daughter had to buy a fish lens from one of the hawkers in the area which turned out to be extremely overpriced as she saw the same item",
          "Have one of the guys selling fisheye lenses take your photo for you - you may have to pay them a bit - but the photo you get will be fantastic.",
          "A shopping delight, great location. Every shop you could need is in this centre. Xmas decorations were up, busy time to visit but pleasant, not changed much in the last 20 years, some restrooms you have to pay to use.",
          "We only look at the Twin Towers across the road at the water fountain. Many \"sellers\" offering small gadgets for ur camera to take the full tower. Nonetheless, quite a magnificent n beautiful twin towers. The last time I came maybe more than 15 years ago... Recommend to",
          "The views by night is just spectacular! Very overcrowded during the day as people just tend to sit there and take up space apposed to taking pics and moving on. There\u2019s loads of people selling wide angle lens and selfie sticks to take pics. It\u2019s no longer the tallest building in",
          "Whether you visit the site during the day or night, its a spectacle to behold. At one point of time, they were the tallest buildings in the world. Post Burj Khalifa, they stand as the tallest twin towers. If you use Instagram, then you haven't visited KL unless you have a",
          "The towers are a sight to behold and a real feat of engineering and no visit to KL would be a real visit without a visit to the towers. The skybridge and the observation decks all have amazng views. It's just a pity that it really felt like you were being herded as cattle to",
          "We gotta say that the view is very impressive. Something more than that? I mean, no... We haven't been inside or on the top, but it is a very famous piece of architecture and we'll worth seeing.",
          "Enjoyed it. Must visit at night and during daytime. Bring a selfie stick !! Also go early to beat the crowds",
          "If you are in Kuala Lumpur ,you cant afford afford to see this iconic building. What a piece or architecture.",
          "Having seen these towers in many a movie, I was eager to get upstairs. However having not pre-booked I was turned away as they had no more tickets for that day. Hopped online and managed to nab one for the following late afternoon. So do book ahead if time is short! The towers",
          "Nice experience Please buy tickets before you get there, around \u00a350 for 2 adults and 3 child we paid. It\u2019s like the burj khalifa in Dubai, attach to shopping mall so always packed. Definitely one to must to when in KL. Well organised to manage guest up/down and well explained",
          "Well orginesed to manage guest up and down. Deffinetly we go there to see over all view kuala lumpur. Compare with other venue to see kuala lumpur. This place is much cleaner, modern and well orginezed to managed guest. All the observation venue is indoor so no worries for heat",
          "Good experience, the lookout on level 86 is great. Because there\u2019s always people the tours sometimes can feel a bit rush. You get a token with a colour collar , and limited time in each section. Time is more than enough for pictures and wondering for a bit. There is no",
          "Went to Petronas towers. Best to prebook tickets online as they get sold out. Lovely view from the SkyBridge. Very organized tour. They tend to waste a bit of time on the last part. We were up there for almost an hour and 30 mins is more than enough.",
          "AMAZING AND SCARY , FOR ME TO HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND. But was really worth a visit. For now the highest tower's, but soon there will be another ready, even higher.",
          "The best eyesoothing skyscraper in KLCC. Try to visit at evening to have the best view as well as enjoy the sunset lights on building.",
          "While I did have the opportunity to ride the lifts up the towers, for me, the Petronas Towers and the marvelous engineering construction are more incredible from the outside. There really is no need to pay 80RM per adult to get enjoyment out of the towers, unless you really",
          "Has to be done if in KUL! Book early or online as sells out fast. Well organised tour but they do try and sell you souvenirs on most levels. Don\u2019t miss out.",

          "Have to say the place is very impresive since you enter the city, once you get inside the towers all the mall is very full of life specially with christmas decoration, and going to the 86 floor enjoying the view of almost whole city is an experience that you cant forget...I",
          "The view from the bridge and top of the tower is great. Well worth the ticket price. It is well organised with each group having a set time to take a look round and take pictures. This is a great idea and reduces congestion you get with other landmarks. Would definitely",
          "I am getting away from the bustle of sg but ended up in another bustle mall. It's too crowded compare with 2 to 3 years back. The personal space in the mall you can never find again. Will not be back next year during the festive season .",
          "Beautiful view, day and night. Didn't go to top as i knew i wouldn't be able to see it and already saw the city film KL Tower. Favourite view was at night and from klcc park.",
          "View from the top is very nice. .Petronas Twin Towers were once the tallest buildings in the world with both towers joined at the 41st and 42nd floors (175m above street level) by a 58 metre-long, double-decker Sky Bridge. Located in the KL city centre, the Petronas Twin Towers\u2019",

          "A must see if you are in KL. We booked via our hotel concierge which does come with a surcharge but is helpful to pin down a time. You can visit and queue yourself if you have the time. The visit takes about an hour and is quite regimented in that you get 15 minutes on the",

          "Going to Kuala Lumpur and not seeing the Petronas Towers would be like going to Paris and not going to see the Eiffel tower. Up close the Petronas towersare even more impressive and a tour to see the views is a must do.",
          "It is still memorable for the second visit this month with family after the first visit in 2003. Suggestions for visitors to take pictures perfectly is to bring an extra lens that can be prepared in advance ...",

          "Amazing views from that height! Also, worth of mentioning it is very well organized experience, no wasted time. There are shopping malls, restaurants and bars on the lower floors. We had our lunch at one of them. The food was good, just waiting lines were long.",
          "Did not manage to visit in the day but the photo spot in the night is breathe taking. No comments on the skybridge and observation deck though as i did not go eventually. It\u2019s not really necessary to head up if you are staying high floor near KLCC.",
          "in the heart of Kuala Lumpur , capitol of Malaysia , around the famous Petronas Towers, you will find after work all people of all colours, ethnics, nations. Large shopping malls, restaurants , bars, places to rest and meet , having fun, taking pictures. the fountains ,",

          "Visited 15/12/2020. I would say the visit was informational but not exciting to write home about. You get approximately 45 minutes tour visiting Skybridge (10 minutes) in groups of around 15, then 87th floor and then to 83rd where its the FIRST SOUVENIR SHOP. Your photo is taken",
          "It\u2019s worth visiting, it was kind of shoulder season so we did not have to wait in long lines to get a ticket.And don\u2019t forget to visit fountain lights with the music in the evening.",
          "Visited on a Sunday afternoon. Had pre-bought my tickets online hence check in was easy. Do note you cannot bring in a large bag though, but you have an option to store it securely at their luggage storage counter. We were brought up in batches of about 20-30(?) people, first to",
          "Malaysia's iconic twin towers. Must visit when coming to Malaysia. There's a shopping mall in between the towers. There's even a park outside. Worth visiting.",

          "Yesterday we wisited the tower and firstly stoped to the bridge for 10 minutes to take fotos. There was nothing special, because it was very, very cold because of air conditioning. The windows were humid and we didn't see enything and it wasn't good for pictures. Then we went to",
          "This isn\u2019t just any tower. Going up in Petronas tower is truly and experience. We enjoyed it more than the Burj Kalif in Dubai. Would recommend going during sunset or at night. The staff didn\u2019t seem hassled and hurried, they don\u2019t make your cram uncomfortably in the elevator and",
          "Be prepared to walk. This was Kuala Lumpur\u2019s old race course on Ampang Road. You can book to go onto the watch area of the towers. Go to the basement. Seniors are charged RM42 each. Careful cause they close for a few hours for prayers on fridays. Lots of brand name shops in",

          "Very good tour of the Twin Towers. Starts with about 10 mins on the lower level of the Sky Bridge connecting the 2 towers. Then up to to the observation deck on the 86th floor for about 20 mins. As each group has a time limit the crowds are minimised.",
          "I checked out my dreams store Tiffany's here for the first time in my life. There are a lot of luxurious outlets here just on the ground floor of petronas tower. There is also an ice skating rink. There is this beautiful fountain show free for all the audience at night just",
          "Any visit to KL has to include a visit to these iconic towers. If you are unfortunate like us to only have one day in KL and it's a Monday you'll find that the building is closed to visitors. However the building is probably better appreciated from the outside (and you can get",
          "Great architecture in the center of the town. Very good restaurants located on the 4th floor of the mall areas inside the towers. Madame Wangs was recommended by our driver and it didn\u2019t disappoint We didn\u2019t go to the observation deck. Felt very safe.",
          "Not being a fan of heights I was a bit concerned about going up the tower. We bought our tickets and headed towards the lifts. The whole experience was amazing. We got taken to the sky bridge first and whilst there were some nerves, I was able to walk across the bridge and enjoy",
          "This structure is clearly the highlight of KL. We booked the 6.15 PM slot, so, we got the twilight view. The entire process is handled very professionally. Things a little rushed as you get only about 45 minutes at the top over two viewpoints. But I thought that it was adequate",
          "Recently visit at Petronas twin towers, so beautiful and awsome Christmas try. I never expect Malaysia do this kind of Christmas decoration.",
          "Made of steel and glass the facade is designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art, Best pics with Petronas is actually from distance that is from the road crossing pavement during day.One will find many tourists there so hard spot to miss. Walk inside Suria Mall to go to",

          "This is a good trip at a reasonable price. Enough time to explore and enjoy. Great views too. Only disappointment was no information or education of construction timescale or detail which would have been informative. Nice shopping centre attached too. See this AFTER the KL",
          "This would be one of the must to do activity while you are in KL. The view is fantastic from the observation deck. beautiful architecture from outside and at night the water fountains are simply awesome. This was my 3rd visit and still if i visit KL i would love to visit this",
          "The tour takes approx 45 minutes and you get to walk on the cross bridge (10 mins), view from the 86th floor observation area (15 mis) and then see the shop (15 mins). Apart from the shop there is lots to see and appreciate in this building beauty! See how the cross bridge copes",

          "Saw these from klcc side and the other side. Klcc side is better I thought. These look great at night all lit up. The buildings themselves aren't actually that nice but the lighting makes them seem amazing. Look out for the phone camera fish eye sellers on the non klcc side.",
          "Great place Well cooled and great atmosphere for the tourists and locals alike. Shopping at ease with well spaced shops and friendly staff",
          "Do not waste time and money to go up there. Its not worth the penny. This is the most over rated attraction I have been to till date. They have no valid reason that why did they built it and what is the significance. No doubt it looks way too pretty and is really eye",

          "Great to return to the worlds tallest twin towers with family. In the monsoon season, the weather can play games with your pre-booked ticket. But it\u2019s imperative to book in advance especially if you would like to secure a sunset view. But it\u2019s greatness can be appreciated at any",
          "We went to the twin towers in the evening, when the lights are up, and the whole experience was next to a dream vacation. The twin towers loom majestically over the skyline of Kuala Lumpur. we went on a weekday and there was no queue for the tickets to the walkway. It was a",

          "This is a fun experience, especially the skyway between the towers, and a great value - much better value than Burj Khalifa that I recently visited (OK, I know it's taller). You get the same weird experience of looking down on very tall buildings, plus great views of the city.",
          "This is a must see if visiting Kuala Lumpur. The area out side the towers is really pretty. There are amazing views from the towers. You stop of at two levels. One around 44 floors then one higher up. Great attraction for kids though to adults.",
          "We did not prebook which I would recommend you do as when I tried to book online the day before it was fully booked. Luckily the concierge at our hotel managed to get us some tickets but we had to pay an extra MYR50 on top of the usual ticket price of MYR80. You have to be at",
          "My main reason for visiting Kuala Lumpur was to see the Petronas Twin Towers and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Even though it is over 20 years old it looks very modern and futuristic. Highlights included visiting the skybridge and the 86th Floor where the views were fantastic.",
          "Really awesome to visit here . Not so many people as it\u2019s quite managed well . It\u2019s so amazing up there you have got to go and see .",

          "You haven\u2019t been to KL if you don\u2019t go visit the Twin Tower. Better to plan ahead and book if you want to go up to the Skybridge. Both day time and night time have a different ambience and the park with the water fountain is a great spot to chill out.",
          "Finally visited the Petronas Towers after the regret of passing it up the first time visiting Kuala Lumpur. They\u2019re iconic, right? How did I miss this experience! I now realise I didn\u2019t miss a thing. Terrible experience. You are given a colour coded lanyard and from this",
          "One of the best experience in Kuala Lumpur is the amazingly spectacular view of the iconic Petronas Twin Towers, especially at night. Truly spectacular...",
          "Having been to a few tall buildings, this was certainly one of my least favourites. The towers themselves are a visual delight, but the experience was not. Usually, in tourist attractions you have a recommended time for visit, which most visitors adhere to, but is subject to the",

          "The towers look amazing at night and the park nearby is so beautiful! At night there is a light show but it doesn't take more than 15 min I guess. It was entertaining tho.",
          "So beautiful in the night time. I loved it. Also all the people around me. Everyone looked happily with their photos",
          "We booked in advance and were in a group of approx 20people. The guide explained about how they were built etc and gave us time to take photos on the bridge between the two towers - some good views! For the price, can\u2019t complain and guess if I\u2019m KL with some time to kill worth",
          "My husband and I visited the towers Saturday night. A truly memorable experience. The staff are so nice and helpful and the whole thing was well organised. Beautiful view of the city and the dancing fountain below.",
          "This is a busy attraction, but thankfully due to the ticket allocation system, we didn\u2019t find it over busy when visiting the bridge or the observation deck. Bit cloudy and rainy when we visited but still had good views. Definitely recommend booking the slot well in advance to",

          "i went to the bridge to enjoy the city view, fantastic experience, better to after 6pm with better view.",
          "I am in love with Petronas Towers ! They are breath taking. Outside as inside! Late Evening is the best time to visit Petronas Tower. This will also give you opportunity to see the Light and fountain show that generally starts at 7pm to 9pm and its just behind the Petronas",
          "I had spent around 3 hours on the last day of my stay in Kuala Lumpur. I wanted to spent some leisure time before I catch my flight. I found it a good decision. Although the shopping mall inside the twin towers are really expensive but it\u2019s a great place to get clicked and for",

          "During the day it seems grandiose and majestic while at night it is lit with beauty. It is full of tourists and the staffs get irritated at times. To have the nest pic with your mobile, go to the far extreme after the fountains and take the best pictures.",
          "Great place for photos, arrived at night a took a short stroll down to the towers. A lot of locals will be trying to sell you little gadgets for your phone for photos. Other than that you'd have to wait a bit to get your desired photo with the angles and what not. Worth the",
          "If you visit Kuala Lumpur whether it's for 1 night or 7 nights, I recommend going to see the Petronas Towers in the KLCC park at night every night. It's spectacular and right in front of the Watershow that happens every night from 8pm. During my 3 months travel it was definitely",

          "Its a lovely view at the top, organised in different colour bands, wold recommend evan for those with a fear of heights its not as scary as it looks. Lots of hawkers outside though who can ger a bit pushy but overall lovely experience.",
          "Went here today. Weather was beautiful so could see for miles. Not scary at all and offers a great view if the city. Very clean. Has all the top chic stores below towers in the mall for the shoppers. View from 86th floor so just one thing to consider. If you don't like small",
          "When planning a visit to the towers you have couple of options and we selected the free option and not to go up. It is a very impressive structure and offers good photo opportunities. If you have time and this is your scene it is probably worth paying and go up the Towers. There",
          "This building is truly spectacular! It is gorgeous and worth the tour inside to see the bridge and observation decks. Once done with the tour, I recommend walking around KLCC, the park, and grounds. It is very clean and nice throughout the area. The mall is a bit pricey but we",
          "Recently many of the restaurants on the outside have closed. Only one real bar, a beer place remains. Before there were several choices. So not a foody or drinking place. Inside the shops are going full blast similar to any upscale mall and there are plenty of junk food",
          "It is impossible to go to KualaLumpur and not visit the Petronas Towers, at least once. They are undoubtedly one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but let's not forget that they are, above all, a tourist attraction and therefore a business",

          "We always take photos from outside, from below the buildings. This time we took opportunity to get the view from top of the towers. Tips is to buy the ticket wayyyyy earlier. i bought my ticket one week earlier but still i didn't manage to get the sunset timing that i want.",

          "I don't like heights but cant miss going up tall buildings when they are so well known. Very striking building and a really nice park and fountains behind for photos. In the tower they move you round in groups and only get 5 to 10 minutes at the skybridge (floor 40+) and then",

          "Very well organised trip up the towers. Efficient staff moving us to see various viewpoints within the time allocated. Disagree with other reviews, the time spent up there was plenty. Recommended and worth the money.",
          "I'm not really into touristy things, but the Petronas towers are worth the time. Book the tickets online in advance, or go there the day before. The tours, 45 minutes long, are super well organized and chockful of information. You stop at the skybridge for a spell then continue",
          "It is cool to see the towers in real life but other than that, you'll just be accosted by street vendors trying to sell you things you don't need. It's very expensive to go to the top to we didn't as there are free places in KL you can get the same type of views",

          "Amazing building, booked tickets in \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 before flying over, good job we did as the evening was sold out. Amazing architecture and views, the only negative for independent travellers is the process is very time based movement of people leading to to long or to short time in",
          "It was amazing to see two tall towers standing parallelly by the busy roads. A huge area of the city was visible while we stood on the bridge connecting the towers. At night, I was spell-bound to see its beauty when the lights were on.",

          "The twin towers are beautiful examples of engineering. It\u2019s a must-visit for the first time trip to Kuala Lumpur. Later on, please skip. Unfortunately, the building is not unique in an area mushroomed with many high rises. There is hardly any tourist information and support",

          "Of course it\u2018s the main attraction in KL but we thought it was not worth the money. If you compare the experience with the one you get at the Burj Khalifa (Dubai), you\u2018ll be bored after you visit at the top. You are not allowed to visit the building on your own and you\u2018ll be",
          "Great walk from hotel. Didn't go up as it is expensive and cloudy. Get really irritated by being told 100 words is minimum review.",
          "Best view of the city from the 80th (I think) floor. Moderate charge to view the top floor but totally worth it. Also had a mall inside with all the luxury brands. Situated very conveniently as it was in the city centre and walking distance from our hotel.",

          "There is a huge amount and a huge variety of habitat here. It allows fishes from all around the world to have a home here. It gives detail explanation and very friendly staff.",
          "tour is good for kids but very short (probably 40m) on a moving carpet. Not elaborate but the kids can put their hands in the water to touch some starfish and other small mollusks. Maybe I have been living here too long but I would say the entry fee is steep for what you get",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful place strategically located at KLCC. I got my ticket booked through my hotel Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur concierge staff. The website serves few information but I found it lacking the concept of e-booking and purchase of ticket like PETRONAS tower visit offers. I",
          "I\u2019ve been to several of these in SE Asia. This one was nowhere as nice as either BKK or Singapore. It was a holiday, filled with people. They had pulled the moving walkways which left much of the under the dome part of the aquarium watching my feet not to trip over the 1\u201d rise",

          "Good to visit this place, just for one time. Better with family of children. But interesting to see and experience the animal world.",
          "Went with my daughter and a friend. We had fun. Aquarium is quite good! No need to purchase photo\u2019s in my opinion as the prices quite shocked me. Take your camera and take your own.",
          "Spent a really enjoyable few hours here with my 3 year old and my mother. Having visited numerous aquariums before I can say this is probably the one that I've enjoyed the most. Staff were so friendly and the exhibits were fantastic. My little girl could have spent all day",
          "Many small fish tanks and a long transport belt inside the huge aquarium. Fish on all sides including big sharks,",
          "RM50 per person is about right. Some interesting displays and a cool tunnel. No need to get your photo taken at any time. Allow 30 to 60 minutes depending on your level of interest in reading all the information.",
          "We went to the Aquaria with young kids. They loved it and was engaged throughout the entire 2 hours there. The highlight was feeding exhibition (at 3:30pm) and the opened pools where we got to feel the shark. The staff at the open pool was excellent. She was friendly, and",
          "The aquarium was hot and not pleasant to be within. Many of the tanks were small and not engaging. It\u2019s is not worth a visit.",
          "Very bad. Not worth the money, too crowded and nothing special. Apparently they have student discount but they don\u2019t tell you until you ask for it. Had problems getting the discount even though showing proof. Very rude employees, don\u2019t care about the customer at all. Just want",
          "Not bad just too small and packed with kids , can\u2019t really get a good view of much . The highlight is to probably the tunnel that you can walk through. Staff wil always ask you to take photos and if you don\u2019t want to you won\u2019t be allowed into the tunnel.",

          "Visited this place about 5 times and I still love it, kids always want to come here as they really enjoy the experience. A bit expensive but it's a lot better than most aquariums around the world. We visited the one in London and never again, very disappointed. Buy this one is",
          "We bought an online ticket hoping for a speedy smooth entry. However, what we encountered was of the opposite. Long queue. All because an entrance photo that needed to be taken. Spoiled our family and children\u2019s mood for the day. Which also showed in the expression of our family",
          "We did not know what to expect from this place but it had good reviews so we gave it a shot. They have a good amount of fish and there is even a few otters you can see frolic around. We really enjoyed the underwater walk where you can see sharks, ray's, and lots of other fish.",
          "Spent nearly 2hrs with two young kids. Easy to get to at KLCC (walkway from Pavilion) Not a massive aquarium but good shark, rays in underwater tank. Can get quite hot when crowded.",

          "The aquarium is lovely, lots of great fishes and sharks. We went to the animation too, the pictures were really over priced and during the shark tunnel other tourists did not stay on the belt, which meant it was a crowded experience.",
          "A must visit if you visit Petro Twin Towers. Its a large aquarium with a lot of different kinds of fish. You will be able to touch and feel baby sharks with your bare hands and also be able to touch star fishes as well.",
          "Funtastic to know more about sea life as well as other creature that giving us experience to know and learn more about sea life. It'd great thing knowing that there's variety of sea life that we never see. Otherwise, we also understand how important sealife in our circle life. I",

          "Good place to visit with your family. Many sea creatures to be seen and learn about marines. It is also suitable for all age especially for children as they can learn and appreciate those things.  It is also very informative for those who would like to know further about the ocean.",

          "All the fish looks happy and healthy, the place is clean and the staffs are really polite and well trained. There's this guy with his kid who cut in front of my pregnant wife while she's queueing to go in, and the staff immediately come and send him back to the back of the line. Kudos to the staff! Well done! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",
          "As with most reviews, I strongly suggest that you start reading from the lowest ranked. To summarise the problems:\n1. The venue is not designed for such a large crowd. The lack of sufficient ventilation means it's hot and very uncomfortable \u2026",
          "At first we thought that this place will be like Singapore's S.E.A so we have high expectations about this place. Well it turns out that the place not really big so we suggest if u want to visit this place comfortably than you should go at \u2026",
          "This place isn't as nice as it used to be. Did it get downgraded? The English in the texts in Aquaria is poor. Such a disappointment and very embarrassing. It's not just on one board or signage it's on almost all of them. This place sucks. Would not recommend it to anyone.",

          "The experience was a bit underwhelming. It\u2019s not as big as you might expect, but that\u2019s honestly okay. What I think they are seriously lacking is better explanation of what you are seeing. I wish there was more information about the \u2026",

          "One of the rarest place you get to see in SE Asia! The entry fee is 75 RM and I would say it's worth the money ! They have large sharks, Sting Rays , Tortoise and many rare species which you see only in Asia ! Inside there are shops where you can get aquarium merchandise ! I thoroughly enjoyed each moment!",
          "If you are want to get the thrill of aquatic life then there could not have been a better place in KL than AQUARIA. Located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur around KLCC, the place offers amazing insight into aquatic lifeforms. There are scores \u2026",
          "By far the best aquarium we have been too. The conveyor belt through the tunnel is a fantastic idea",
          "The place is a very educational place. This place is very suitable for family leisure while educating children.",
          "Visited here after getting voucher from Klook. Was very worth the time to visit, especially for kids. Not as big as I had hoped it would be but the tunnel tank is pretty cool. Would definitely recommend if you are visiting KLCC and have an hour or two to spare.",
          "It is large. Different collections of sea fishes and animals are seen. Have a long tunnel to watch fishes. Overall good. But the entry fee is 75RM, high for the aquria i think.",
          "I suggest yall to visit this place but not during peak season/holidays. I came here during Chinese New Year and it was packed and crowded as hell. I mean the place is good, air-conditioned (except in the tunnel aquarium where it gets warmer \u2026",

          "overall a great experience to have with families especially children. we get to see the big sharks and stingrays in the sea tunnel and that was awesome but the tunnel was quite small so if crowded it gets a bit hot. plenty of sea creatures \u2026",
          "The Aquarium Tunnel is so great, diverse species of sharks and other fishes are just above you. Just don't come at holiday season, it will be very crowded and hot. \ud83d\ude04",
          "Really nice place. A little short for the money. Not being able to reverse direction to watch feedings is just crazy. I wanted to vlog shark feeding for YouTube but you can't enter once you exit. That's a pro tip. Plan your trip accordingly. You can get through it in about 30 mins so don't arrive too early.",
          "Aquarium? Feels more like a market. Air-conditioning barely working, so hot. So much people around, you could barely walk. Tripping hazards everywhere, travelators in tunnels are not even running. They should limit the amount of people they let in by batches to help make the experience even a little enjoyable.",
          "I loved the place completely... There is so much of sea species to see... Totally worth the time and money... Well maintained and organized",
          "Not recommend go on public holiday..and please buy online ticket ...it really easy ..no need queue up",
          "Though slightly pricy for tourists outside Malaysia this place is certainly a must visit. The tiger sharks are a must see marine life here. Had a wonderfull time here. Just at the exit there is a stall which is about virtual interaction with various exotic animals. Please avoid it. Not worth.",
          "Good experience for first timers. Lots of marines creatures to watch. Good to improve your knowledge about aquatic animals.",
          "Good to bring kids to enjoy various types of fish. Avoid going during weekends or public holidays if you want more space to enjoy the ocean animals or to take photos. Not spacious like USS but decent one for city centre. One thing I like, helpful staff and very informative.",
          "This place have huge indoor aquarium that have various aquatics species like fishes, \ud83e\udd88 sharks, sea tortoise and other ocean creatures. We had a wonderful experience there. Its an amazing creation. Must visit place in Kuala Lumpur.",
          "The aquarium is not that bad. It has a wide variety of fish and is quite informative. However, it seems a bit dated and the signage is not so easy to read. Most negative point for me: very busy (even though according to Google Maps it can \u2026",
          "Very friendly staff, great exhibits, great facilities and great informations about the wildlife and how to help it. \nKind of small but definitively worth a visit",

          "Quite decent sized aquarium some good underwater views with sharks roaming around.\nWill take you about 40-60mins to complete at a decent pace and stops.",
          "It's one of the best place to visit when you're in KL, foreigner entry cost $18 that's around 1500INR, you will not regret spending money on this",
          "Nice place to see fishes. The tunnel is very fun area to watch the fishes. But its too crowded, hot and humid. The travelator not working either. Making the experience is less enjoyable. I'd suggest to visit on weekday for better experience. Avoid at weekend and school holidays.",
          "It's a must visit place if you are in KL. Hundreds of species, remarkable ambiance, friendly staff and most exciting thing was to touch crabs. That's true, they allow you to touch crabs and star fish. Highly recommended this place to all tourist.",
          "Overall was good. Mom loves this place. Its just the ambience was a bit heaty",
          "The whole experience would be perfect if the management is not too greedy, taking as much visitors possible at one time. IT IS AN OCCUPANCY HAZARD! Imagine if, god forbid, something bad happen, would you guys be able to get everyone out in \u2026",

          "It's a lot smaller than we imagined and for what you get it is very expensive. We were done in about 50 minutes. The tunnel is excellent though and the tanks are large and well maintained. There's a strong focus on conservation which is nice to see and overall It's good, just a shame there wasn't more of it to justify the price.",
          "This place have huge indoor aquariums that have various species of fishes and other ocean creatures. We had a wonderful experience here. The entry is paid, I recommend to buy your entry tickets in advance to avoid long queue. The place is \u2026",

          "A great way to spend an hour or so close to the Petronas towers. \n\nThis is a small exhibit space but with some excellent exhibits. Take your time and enjoy the moving walkway which takes you underneath the main aquarium tank. You\u2019ll have \u2026",

          "It was great learning experience for adults and kids. A lot of exciting and great exhibit. Try to avoid weekends and school holidays as the place will be crowd. The staff handle the crowd very well. \n\nSome staff was rude. Some of them are not well informed of their exhibit.",
          "It is located at KL CC to be preparation visitors and Suriya KLCC we can go inside the KLCC mall And there are direction boards about each and every escalator as well it is really nice inside the Aquaria if you are Malaya citizen it is \u2026",

          "Very nice aquarium. Incredible location. Very friendly staff however very over priced if you buy their photos..",
          "One of the best aquariums in the heart of KL. Kids would have a great time. Each species & their descriptions are clearly mentioned. Tourists who are unable to visit Singapore aquarium must visit Aquaria KLCC. It's a paradise underground for tourists who visit aquariums for the first time.",
          "The aquarium itself was pretty good. Especially the feeding sessions (piranha's, otters, and more). Only rating this a 3* as there is no food inside and they wouldn't let us step outside to get any so I was mildly hangry the whole time",
          "Great sea life exhibition but the otters were hungry... they kept knocking on the door where the food came from. Heartbreaking.",
          "This is unique. Have seen many aquariums in India and abroad. But not the species in this.",
          "Amazing maritime experience. Nice collection of corals and fishes. However activity and lighting could be improved",
          "Indoor aquarium around KLCC. It can be a stop for family tourists. Your kids may happy to visit it.",
          "The best time to come is not during school holiday... It's like a journey in tunnel beneath ocean where you can see a lot of fish.",
          "Aquaria is the best place to visit in Kuala Lumpur if you are a marine world lover. It is situated in the city centre, in the Convention Centre. Once you get there pay attention to the signs, they will tell you direction to the Aquaria. The \u2026",

          "This place is amazing especially for kids. My 7 year old daughter was so happy to see the sharks, the eel, the fish and many more sea creatures which are so different from what she has watched from the TV. Moreover, when a man feed them, we \u2026",
          "Best place to bring family. Especially kids. On holiday tour if your in Kuala Lumpur.",
          "Great Attraction. Very well maintained and friendly staff. Best to avoid Public Holidays and weekends so you can avoid the crowds and actually enjoy the hands on experiences. They have live aquariums where you even touch same of the marine life.",
          "My 2nd time visit to Aquaria, it was fun. I gain so much experience & learn something about the marine life. To see all the creatures live is one of the unforgettable moments",
          "Small but very informative place, all day program that makes you busy all time. Many information presented in interesting way that leaves you will alot of ideas and new subjects to explore",

          "Good collection of marine life at one point ...Under water sea experience..Awesome",
          "It\u2019s very crowded on weekend. The best part is the tunnel where you can see the sharks. Others were just nice. Use klook to buy tickets it\u2019s much cheaper.",
          "Overall the experience was great. The main highlight was definitely the underwater tunnel where you can see the sharks and manta rays, it is so fascinating to look at.",
          "it is too small for the price.. i think i enjoy more water world at langkawi. got penguin some more. its more worth it. since the price almost the same if you buy online. otherwise when think about the distance then okay la for your kids experience.",
          "Amazing spot. It can get warmer especially in the tunnels. Some people still use flash despite all the warning signs",
          "A very well thought out place. The experience was enjoyable and educational for the young ones. We'll worth the price of admission.",
          "Aquaria KLCC, located on the concourse level of the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, is said to be one of the largest aquariums in Southeast Asia. Home to over 150 species of marine life, its star attractions include scary tiger sharks, \u2026",

          "Suitable place for families. Varieties of fish and sea life stuff are displayed. Children will love it",
          "Such a mind blowing place, you will have aquatic life around you, and all you can do is rejoice it",
          "Was a nice day out with my wife and our 1 year old. Staff divers deliver an interactive experience while feeding with a bit of humour. However, it got quite crowded especially problematic with a stroller while lifts are not easily \u2026",
          "Nice place to introduce our kids about sea animal\ud83e\udd88\ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc21",
          "Good place to visit if you've not visited any kind of aquariums before but if you have you can skip it.",
          "This is a good, but older aquarium that is great for kids. The main draw is the moving tunnel with large sting rays, turtles and sharks swimming over and around you. They take lots of pictures which are pricey (85 MYR for one) but is a cute keepsake.",
          "Bought tickets from MATTA fair which for RM33. went on a weekend. Crowded but worth the visit.\nMore than 100 species of sea creatures.\nBeautiful and stunning view",
          "It was an educational experience for us. However since it was the school holidays, it was very crowded. Worse when the air condition is not cold and it was too stuffy inside and made us all very uncomfortable. Also, there were no water & \u2026",
          "A very decent aquarium with a wide selection of fish.\n\nA few gimmick exhibits, and various \"enhanced\" rurality experiences.\n\nThe main attraction is definitely the under water tunnel, that features again a great verity. And the fish get nice and close to you.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit in my opinion.",
          "Good place, not too big but keep many beautiful sea creatures",
          "Place was nice & well kept, but crowd control has to be more \"systematic\", went there for the 1st time to expose my son to the undersea world but feels like walking around in a night market. Ended up missing a lot of attraction \ud83d\udc4e",
          "We went there last Sunday. They have a good collection of marine life. My daughter really enjoy it. Maybe as a suggestion they can create some section that enable the visitors to interact or touch some of the fish that human-friendly to make it more interesting for the kids.",
          "Nice facility for KL standards. Clean, well kept and interesting. Kids loved it. Only black mark is your staff insisting to get paid photos despite there being a large cue to the conveyor belt. In the end your staff member actually held out her arm to block us from going through without getting a photo. \ud83d\ude12",
          "Love to see the fish and creatures here. But please, walk slower.",

          "Amazing place. Asia's largest aquarium. You will find all kind of Fishes here. Starting from small fish to large fish. Ex: Pirahana, Shark, Gold Fish, swordfish, pinnate, sea horse, clown fish, mandril... A life time experience this will be and for kids it will be an educational tour.\nAvg. Spend time: 2-3hrs",
          "It's awesome, must visit. But entry fees is too high for foreigners.",

          "I had a wonderful experience. The tickets are a little high (69RM) but considering the fact that they have so much marine life to take care it is understandable. Very good place to go with kids as you learn a lot. Seeing marine animals on \u2026",
          "If you like Aquariums this will be your jam. Well worth an hour of your time which is all it took us to complete it. Nice but not as big as I was expecting. In saying that it is very well done and I really enjoyed the glass tunnel through the aquarium....even with the 400 school kids there....",
          "Avoid during very crowded days. \n1. There is very little crowd control once you are past the ticket gate.\n2. Lots of queue cutters. \n3. Bad ventilation (especially in the \"tunnel\"), aircon is practically non existent.\n4. Very pram \u2026",

          "Awesome we enjoyed alot. Its look great",
          "It's good for time pass. Nd we can see alot of fishes  there...",
          "Very interesting for kids. However, many kids just stand in front of the aquarium while using their phones blocking the views of others. Being parents, they should know civic manners. \n\nAlso, if parents just couldnt be bothered, the premise management should intervene  as this is a public place. They need to buck up on this.",
          "Got decent discounted tix with klook app.\nWas a good outing for the kids but no wow factor aside from the tiger sharks and the walk through overhead aquarium. We were in and out in 45 minutes or less",
          "Just ok. Interesting but Too small tho. One Photo print is rm85. One Small photo print for key ring is rm60. No arrangement for any fish show or feeding.",
          "I visited on 25.12.19. Unpleasant experience while I was queueing at the photo session before the tunnel at 11am. The lady staff was extremely rude. A visitor was trying to cut my queue and as I was trying to maintain my queue, the staff \u2026",
          "It's pretty decent ,there u can experience many sorts of ordinary ,common ,small ,big ,creepy-looking ,cute-looking pretty much it's worth to see. Also theres a tunnel like tank there u can see many big and small sea creatures and u can see baby sea creatures\nDon't forget save the ocean from plastic",
          "There were lots of ocean creatues to see and my son had so much fun.  My only concern was the price of the photo.. There were only two package rm 85 and rm 150.i think the price was to much.. But the experience was very nice.",
          "Much quite and nice place. I say it's slightly better that santosa islands. Value for money. Should visit once.",
          "Good 2 hr visit. Kids might enjoy more. Make sure you book the tickets through Klook app... They were 30% cheaper with non Malaysian passport",
          "Informative places! Alot of interesting endemic animals",
          "I would prefer Langkawi's Aquarium. It has more details about fishes, clearer view and also bigger walking space. The only thing I like in Aquari is they have Sharks. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd88\ud83e\udd88\ud83e\udd88",
          "Prefer Buying online ticket if not you must in a long queue",
          "My gf said that lobster, crab and shark should be in the same aquarium, so that she'll be satisfied by seeing food. Ok joke aside, it's great to go but abit pricey",
          "Very disappointing. There were more staff there than guests; some employees persistently tried to sell 'free photo', others stood in groups talking loudly or laughing, which is very annoying if you trying to make a movie. When I refused a \u2026",
          "Want to have glimpse of the entire sealife without actually going inside? Just visit Aquaria KLCC. it takes you through a tunnel within the virtualized ocean and you can see sharks sea turtlea and sting rays swimming above you.. the feeling \u2026",
          "What not to love? Nothing! This place is awesome to bring along your kids to learned and get close to sea creatures.. Oh and also fresh water ones.",
          "Quite good concept however inside glass tunnel is very hot and not convenience. The rest is good.",
          "If you like fishes and nature.. this is a perfect place for you.. so many types and species to be observe.. seeing upfront on how they feed the sharks.. it is really an amazing and magical experience..",
          "Plenty of space for kids to play.Inexpensive kayaking  with gorgeous views and wildlife galore!",
          "For locals, it may be worth it but as a foriegner traveling to different prices. The exhibits are lackluster and makes you wonder if years of research to build awareness is reflected only by a 30 minute anticlimactic experience. Yuck. Information is good. Dual language.",
          "The beatiful park and the fountain",
          "This place provides you with the best the sea has to offer \nCollection of amazing fishes and sea creatures \nVery informative \nGood place to visit with family",

          "The space is not too big but still I have fun enjoying seeing the beautiful sea creatures. Worth the visit. Will definitely come again.",
          "Neat . Place was well maintained and good infra too . Very easy to access and most exhibits were on child level . Stroller accessible.",
          "This is my first visit after 4 years. I remember the display was a lot better. The fish in display looks lethargic and tired, and lost some of its sheen. The freshwater tanks in the river section seems better maintained with the vivariums \u2026",
          "It cost around 79ringitt but it's worth it. U can get a discounted ticket online. It has amazing collections and the entire set up is just beautiful. It has housed many number of sharks, huge stingrays, turtles,jellyfish,seahorses and other countless varieties.",
          "It is a nice place to spend a couple of hours. I went with my family and it was fun. They have various aquatic animals and they are well maintained. The underwater glass tunnel is an experience to have. They have small section with insects \u2026",
          "Best aquarium in Malaysia. Ticket pricing is also very good. But sometimes it can get very crowded and there are small tunnels so you can get cramped.",
          "A very different experience here you can see Shark also here.",
          "it will definitely be my go to activity whenever I am  visiting here",

          "I really loved this place. Little crowded by they maintained it very well. Plethora of fish species as well as exhibitions.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. It has a wide variety of marine species and the ambience is too good... It also have shopping options too..",
          "just nice.. not really amazing like I come before.. 14 years ago..",
          "I love animals, went there with the loved one, we have great time together! The ticket is affordable, not too pricy, but online got few ringgits discount.",
          "Fish is more than wonderful because I love fish but tired and full of people and the price is high and everything is inside The fictional price of a small water bottle 4 ringgit I advise to take clean water better for photography lovers Taking a camera because of the lights",
          "We have been to a number of Aquariums, and KLCC's Aquaria was visited around noon on 22/02/2020. It was a place that we had planned and highly anticipated for quite some time. Myself having a very strong background in ecology.\n\nFrankly, \u2026",
          "Great place to see unique types of fish, some parts are quite immersive, the tour was a bit short at around an hour, but there are other activities you can do there as well, like rage cage and feeding",
          "Okay, not bad. The type of species is too little. The price is standard. Actually SEA aquarium in singapore is much more nice and more expensive. Only can give 3 stars. Sorry..",
          "Not a good experience for a visit during holiday season.  Can't enjoy seeing the fish in the aquarium. A lot of people. Hot hot hot. Stuffy inside the tunnel.",
          "Great experience for the kids. Our son enjoyed it and is only 2 1/2 yrs of age. A good place to see whilst travelling here",
          "A place to hangout with the kids. Get your tickets online from various travel sites for a hassle free check in and its cheaper too! Dont forget to check out their feeding time before u go. U dont want to miss especially the shark and king crab feeding. Enjoy!",
          "best place to visit especially when you have kids. there are lots of rare species of fishes and the best part is to enjoy 90m tunnel of large aquarium with sharks and giant stingray",
          "A must place to visit when you visit Malaysia. This is located at Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. This is one of the largest aquarium in Southeast Asia. It will be exiting for children. The inside architecture is soooo natural. It required around 2 to 3 hrs time to spend for all creations.",
          "a bit small but it was way better than the one in singapore.",
          "It's amazing to have this aquarium in the middle of a capital. The fish species is amazing, the set up is nice. Got a attractive family package with klook.\n\nA suggestion to the aquarium: to implement time session with visitor limit. We went \u2026",
          "Kids friendly place, many varieties of sea creatures to see. Dont go during high season. A very recommended place to be with ur kids to learn more about sea creatures",
          "very nice experience, worthy to come, got tunnel, different type of environment such as mangroves, deep sea, flooded forest etc. Got feeding schedule time, is best to come on morning as most of the feeding time is morning.",
          "Having a good time with family.. Tips: please buy an online ticket before coming because it is much more cheaper and time saving from buying ticket over the counter..",
          "There are huge, enormous and beautiful sharks and marine animals. Kids should visit the place with thier parents to improve knowledge about marine life.",
          "A nice Aquarium, a little hidden away but ideal for KLCC and shopping",
          "Great place for kids and if you want to spend a little time away from the city hustle.",
          "Too much people but excellent its a fantastic world with plenty of fishes and the display is great",
          "Nice place but only for the first time . Big money for that in fact it doesn't cost it.",
          "Was awesome. However, the photographs taken at the attractions are abit pricey in my opinion. 3 pics for rm90. But it was a good shot and the photographers were friendly and asked us to pose in many different poses in the \"shark tunnel\" and \u2026",
          "Lovely place. friends and families can go there for a fun day to see the creatures of the sea and learn new facts about it, there is a cameraman in every stop to take memorable moments, it's your choice to buy it later or not. There is also a souvenir shop at the end of the tour.",
          "Great place but there's little crowd control on the day we went. It's simply overflowing with people",
          "Very good place to bring family. Lots of attraction. 1 con is limited space for visitors during fish feeding time at 12.30pm.",
          "Well, locqted in the centre of the town, this place has its own pride, the collection of fish is amazing, eventhou i love Ancol Seaworld better. At some specific reason, i love how they managed the collection of fish. About the souvenir \u2026",
          "Its look like you entering the ocean. There are many kind of fish you can see and learn how they life and grow.Look so natural dan huge. Come here with children will creat good memories. Like this place so much, will definitely come here next time with family.",
          "It was a good experience, especially for kids. There were the regular sea creatures and some uncommon once like the otters. The way it's arranged is great and informative. They have photos taken at every juncture which could be without. Overall a good 1hr spent.",
          "Its a very nice aquarium, my only issue would be how many times they try to get money out of you with fifteen different pictures, worth going though",
          "Nice place to kill time with family..Tips : for cheaper and fast, without queing, buy e-tickets from online (shopee). Less hassle!",
          "Overall it was good but could be better if not visiting at holiday, because it came so hot and packed with people.  And also seek the event schedule to make it more worth to visit.",
          "A place that must be seen in KL. Absolutely worth every penny you pay although when you buy the ticket it seems a bit expensive. a A very good collection of fresh water and salt water fish. Natural layouts, well maintained , friendly and \u2026",
          "Various type of fishes and sea creatures but during the holiday, there are 2 posts for taking visitors photo created jammed  outside and inside the aquaria....not a very good idea even we know the company would like to get as many profit they could....please pity the visitors who just want to enjoy their visit in peace and harmony...",
          "Place was alright. Just DO NOT visit on a public holiday. It was soo packed. The underwater tunnel was so jam packed I felt like suffocating in there. The crowd control was not good. There were some visitors who couldn't take the crowd and \u2026",
          "Very very bad experience. Super crowded when public holiday. Management should improve on this. Limit the head count each entry so that the place not so crowded.  Definitely won't come again.",

          "Was a nice place to see variety of sea life. However, minus one star for the glass tunnel at the end of the journey. Was quite warm and the glass gave me slight motion sickness. Would still recommend if you are in the area.",
          "Very well managed...such rare collection of aquatic species...",
          "Quite good experience for kids, awesome underwater tunnel, i thought the experience is okay, expected more. Must visit for first timer here, we wont back for 2nd visit i think.",
          "Good learning experience especially for my young ones. Reasonable entrance fee. Recommend to buy tickets online via traveloka , lazada or shopee to beat the queues.  Can be crowded on public holidays, in which you will find people hogging \u2026",

          "My family enjoyed most of a time at this place. However it's just take in an hour to complete tour inside the aquaria. A bit crowded. Deducted 1 point for forcing u to take a pictures. Among 10 staff got 2-3 that are very not friendly and \u2026",
          "Not recommended with family. Too conjusted  place",
          "My daughter is 2 yo. She enjoyed a lot and so did I. :)",
          "Wonderful place to be. Keep 1 hour for this place. Variety of marine life cab be seen. A glass tunnel also takes you through under the water body wherein you can pass through colorful marine fish and sharks. Before exit there is also a souvenir shop to collect momentous.",
          "Had a family trip and enjoyed the experience. There weren't a lot to see during off-peak season.",
          "Been wanting to visit Aquaria for so long. Love this place. Suitable for school holidays plan.",
          "Nice exhibits. But Air conditioning was down today..expect better for a major attraction",
          "Really good place to spend time with friends/family.. Decent variety of marine life, good place to visit but not a must visit.. \nI would rate this place a 7/10 as a traveller",
          "This place is really nice to see creatures from near i love this place",
          "This is such a good aquarium. It has many fishies and even reptiles and mammals. This is not only a aquarium, it is a zoo!",
          "U wont be able to realise when time has flowen away",
          "Walkway is too small to walk around when is pack with people. As usual maintenance is not properly done. Is time to upgrade the facilities. Overall experience is still acceptable.",
          "A must visit place for foreigners. Its bit pricy though",
          "Good place to bring your kids.  Lots of activities, touching sharks, viewing fish closely, and lots of information there.",
          "The place is not organized well. SeaWorld in dufan way much better \ud83d\ude09",
          "I would like to suggest for Aquaria to upload photos on your website and send a QR code to customers who took photos with you. They can just check out and make payments online if they wish to purchase the photo. This initiative will avoid long queue at your confined space and offer a  better customer experience for us.",
          "Good for the sake of experience but not the best, especially for someone who has been to SEA aquarium in Singapore.",
          "Honestly a bit more underwhelming that I expected. It was quite small and cramped and I kind of felt bad for the animals. The space itself is located underneath the convention center and is quite pricey considering how big it is. I won't really recommend going here unless you want to go through a super long underwater tunnel.",
          "Nice place, but small and too expensive.  More expensive than most other aquariums I went to in other parts of Asia",

        "wiki": "A gated attraction, Kuala Lumpur Bird Park (Malay: Taman Burung Kuala Lumpur) is a 20.9-acre (8.5 ha) public aviary in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is a popular tourist attraction in the country, receiving an annual average of 200,000 visitors. It is located adjacent to the Lake Gardens within a KL green lung in Bukit Aman, close to the National Mosque and Royal Malaysian Police Museum. The Bird Park houses more than 3,000 birds representing more than 200 species in an enclosed aviary. About 90% are local birds and 10% were imported from countries such as Australia, China, Holland, Indonesia, New Guinea, Tanzania and Thailand.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bird park is part of the 60-hectare (150-acre) Lake Gardens, which were established in 1888. In addition to the 20.9-acre (8.5 ha) bird park, which was created in 1991, the gardens include an artificial lake, the National Monument, the Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park, the Deer Park, Orchid and Hibiscus gardens, and the former Malaysia Parliament House. It is one of the world's largest covered bird parks. The park has been sited on a hillside in Bukit Aman, with netted walk-in aviaries hugging the slopes and folds on the hillside.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nBird-watching is a common activity here where the flora and fauna is rich. The Kuala Lumpur Bird Park has earned a reputation among those who are keen on the study of birds in their natural habitat. Some of them include research scientists who monitor bird nests for the study of behavioral patterns.\n\n\n== Admission Fees (as of May 2019) ==\nThe KL Bird Park is open from 9am to 6pm daily including public holidays. After paying the admission fee, guests will be given a bar-coded wrist band and paper map of the park's layout and attractions.

It\u2019s very outdoorsy so you\u2019ll get wet if you get caught in the rain after the bird show. The overflowing",
          "One of the highlights of our visit to Kuala Lumpur was to spend a whole morning in the bird park. It is very extensive and has a large area where birds can fly freely under netting . The bird park has several areas including a Flamingo Lake, cages for parakeets, an area with",

          "I'd been looking forward to the bird park but was left very disappointed by it. It advertises itself as \"free-flying\" but most of the birds were in cages that weren't particularly nice. At over 60 Ringgit, it is far too expensive and I wasn't convinced they took good care of the",
          "Right in the middle of the city but you wouldn\u2019t know it. It\u2019s lovely strolling around the grounds seeing a great variety of birds in one spot. Make sure you buy a small bag of fish food to feed the koi fish inside, the pond starts to bubble as they fight to get to the food.",

          "I arrived at around 9.30am and almost had the park to myself. It\u2019s one of the easiest walking park I\u2019ve ever been to. You get to be so close to the birds and they are also pretty tame. Also a first for me to see a white peacock. Very good place for families or individuals who",

          "To escape the fumes and noises of the city we decided to visit the Birds'Park. It's said to be the largest covered park where birds can fly under a net. We didn't see so many birds flying but could observe monkeys running over the net. While peacocks, storks, geese of all sorts",
          "I have been to KL Bird Park few years before and now the old charm is not there. If you compare the huge entry fee nothing worth to see. Yes, you can walk around in the jungle like atmoshpere and get relaxed other than watching lots of peacock walking on almost all walkways.",

          "My partner and I used the hop on hop off bus to get here, the bird park itself is ok, there's birds roaming around, fish ponds, and live shows. If you have kids they will like it. You can take pictures with some really beautiful birds for 15rm (see attached pics)",
          "Enjoyed two hours strolling round the park. Great to be so close to the birds and to feed some of them.",
          "Reviews about this park were largely varied, some say it is terrible and others say it is wonderful but I would say it is \"inbetween\". We LOVE birds, so enjoyed the opportunity to get up close and personal with some and even enjoy feeding gorgeous birds such as the huge",

          "This bird park is one of a kind. I was honestly not expecting much from this visit but it truly was an amazing experience. Flightless birds are not caged - they roam about with tourists. Also got to feed and hold colourful parrots!",
          "The park has always been entertaining with loads of activities and things to see. Children was always excited coming here.",
          "This place is fantastic in the open flight areas but should remove the small cages which are old fashioned displays. Some of the visitors are ignorant too trying to touch the birds and not respecting them. A gang of six men (estimate 20-25 years old) were acting like children",
          "Spend 2-3 hours here strolling around in your own time. The birds are beautiful and well cared for with lots of space to fly and lots of staff feeding and making sure the grounds are beautiful. We loved the restaurant too!",

          "This aviary is well kept and it was great to see so many beautiful birds flying or wandering around. We also noticed a group of monkeys who had gotten in through a gap in the netting at the top to get to the food in the feeding stations. A few birds seem to have gotten out too.",
          "Great 2 hours spent at the KL bird park. Even the teens were delighted with the array of birds to see. They especially lived the Scarlet Ibis which we only saw 1 of. For RM210 for 3 of us I think it was good value. We all loved hand feeding the parrots (for only RM2)! We loved",
          "Despite this being in the middle of the City (we walked from the nearby MRT station) this is a huge space! Most of the birds have lots of space to roam around and the habitat is lovely with rivers flowing through. There is a good variety of birds here - lots that I had never",
          "Gave the back the broken piece and told them to keep it. Hope that will bring them good luck. She said she check all the money but I have only Rm 3 from all the change from the park. One from front counter and two ringgit from the shop.",
          "I was very disapointed with the Park ....if it not for the 1pm Bird show is not worth the money~to pay so much money for a walk and not see birds ~its not worth it ~even if you are a bird lover ~plius no direct transportation to the park by the time you get there already tired",
          "The whole park in general is extremely beautiful to walk through, with several different plants, trees and lakes as well as the many birds species, of course! As said in the park's description, it is a free flight aviary so there are birds everywhere, flying around like they",
          "The place was quite ok but after long distance walk, you will find the place quite creepy if no one around but peaceful at the same time. It was separate in many zone if not mistaken and certain zone feel like I\u2019m walking at the backyard of my house",

          "Was brilliant, just wandering around with peacocks, cranes, storks and all sorts just meandering about as they do, well worth it to go and get lost in for a long while in Kuala Lumpur, just a bit of a walk to get to but well worth it trust me",
          "A must visit from a couple of hours or half a day for all ages. The bird park was great a wide variety of birds to see. The surrounding park with water features variety of trees and fauna. And a peaceful retreat from the city. Would recomend.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you have half a day spare. So many varieties of bird to see, as well as a few cheeky monkeys. Entrance was 63 ringgit per adult on the gate. There are plenty of places to sit down throughout the park as it was very humid indeed, which made the walk",
          "We first visited here in 2002 in our first visit to KL and only remember the entrance, I am guessing it must have been a very different place back then as I am sure I would have recollected being surrounded by birds able to walk right up to you and were pretty much free to fly",
          "We visited on an overcast and wet day so perhaps that is why we did not see a great variety of birds. Lots of Yellow-billed Storks, Sacred Ibises and Peacocks. The ostriches looked very unhappy, having lost many of the feathers from their backs. It was raining so much when we",

          "The biggest bird park we have ever visited! It felt like an experience as opposed to a typical zoo because of the free roaming aspect of the aviary. Many remarkable species, notably storks, pelicans, and a scarlet ibis. Make sure to check this out when you visit KL. It was a",
          "The bird park is another tropical gem in the city. The trees, the flowers, the vegetation make you feel like you are in a tropical paradise. Then you add the birds and its just an amazing experience. Wonderful for families with kids, big and small. Everyone will enjoy this, I",

          "The bird sanctuary looked amazing from outside - a vast netted area where birds can fly freely. The birds were really well cared for, clean housing and plenty of food, but it was all a bit sad seeing some of them in cages. It was on the pricey side for what it was - not sure",

          "The birds were cute and adorable. I was truly surprised that a lot of birds were free to roam around the park. Thankfully, they were all very tame and were not aggressive towards the visitors. The park was very clean and I enjoyed the bird show at the amphitheatre!",
          "Wear non slip shoes because there are some slippery mossy bricks. For a bird lover like me, this was fantastic (see multiple species of hornbills!). But even people with a casual interest in birds would enjoy the walk and scenery. (I went first thing in the morning 9 am for",

          "I won\u2019t goto zoos and unfortunately this is a zoo. Though some of the birds are in areas that they can fly and move around most are in small cages. I did enjoy seeing some of the colourful birds but they are captive now and entertainment for people :(.",

          "We absolutely loved this walk in aviary with the beautiful birds however we feel that the photo opportunity may be abit exploitative for the birds as they are under a light and can be stressed out due to the tons of people around. Other than that it was a lovely experience.",
          "It is truly a top attraction in Kuala Lumpur that I recommend to see to see for couples and families. An amazing park full of all sort of kinds of birds, it was incredible to be able to be so near the birds and even to able to touch and feed them was my favorite part.",
          "Firstly - 63RM (about \u00a312!) - far too expensive for a poor attraction. Hardly \"a world of spectacular birds and a tropical paradise\". I mistakenly thought that I would see loads of birds native to Malaysia & Kuala Lumpur. Nope - plenty of peacocks that I could see at National",
          "Some of the birds' cages/shelters appeared to be a little small etc. The horn bills we saw were all kept separate and alone when on the into boards it states that they are usually found in pairs (this may be normal however) although one appeared to be calling for its mate. No",

          "A well-maintained bird park that's perfect for families! Birds just fly freely within this aviary and they're very close to the visitors. Sometimes a bit too close that the birds might peck, but keep your distance and you'll be fine. Kids will definitely have a fun time watching",
          "A lot of different bird species to see, an enjoyable day out and worth the cost. The park could do with some maintenance on its facilities but in general it was ok. We would definitely visit the park again",
          "This place was only mildly interesting to us but they did have plenty of different bird species to look at. We had decided to do a walking tour around this green area of the city and popped in here because we really felt like there wasn't as much to see in the surrounding area",
          "1 star is pushing it as many of the truly beautiful birds were in cages, way too small for anybody's liking. The bird park seem to be promoting animal cruelty as there were minimal trees in the cages and lack of space making them stress and lose their feathers. Many of the",
          "Went to visit bird park as had seen good advertising about it. On arrival saw the big area for birds to fly freely, but that was only part 1 of 4 of the park. All the other areas including the most beautiful birds e.g. horbills were in tiny cages with dirt on the ground,",
          "I visited this park once when I was about 10 years old and 20 years later it was still a wonderful experience. You can spend a couple of hours strolling around the grounds where birds of all species and colours are walking and flying around happily with plenty of room to enjoy",
          "This is a great place to spend a few hours and do something a little different while you visit Kuala Lumpur. There park is split into a few different sections where the birds can fly around and do as they please. There are paths and walkways that you walk around and try to",

          "A casual stroll through this superb sanctuary is really worth it. Many birds to see in an open and bird friendly attraction. Well priced for entry and good prices on the snack food available, but don't take your eyes off it as the birds are keen to pinch a morsel when they can,,",
          "We walked the 250m down the side road from the Perdana Botanical Gardens to the entrance. Paid MR63 per adult. Ignored signs at entrance stating \"no bags, no water bottle or own food..put bags in locker etc\" Didnt see this being enforced - an old sign? The park is on a hillside",

          "This ais a nice trip with kids. The birds are so different from anything I have ever seen before. There are also a few cheeky moneys thrown in. It rained torrentially during our stay which meant we had to cut it short. The hop on hop off bus stops outside the gates. Aug 16",
          "*except for one or two things. This Bird Park certainly has a lot of haters; others would have you believe it\u2019s some kind of Shangri-La. As with everything, the reality is somewhere in between. The grounds are well looked after and generally nice without being breathtaking.",

          "A bit expensive, but the walk around the park is great and I found it very relaxing. They have a great number of different birds, a manageable amount of information about them. Was not overcrowded at all. The ticket price was a little expensive for KL but probably far value for",
          "This was a pretty good bird park, with lots of different species of birds. The park was well planned out and there was ample places to grab a drink along the way. Great gift shop at the end too. There could be some better signage throughout though. Fun hour spent there.",

          "I last visited the KL Bird Park in 1999, and although my recollection of that visit is a little hazy I do recall that the basic structure of the park and the exhibits were broadly similar. In Malaysia that's probably a good indication that the park is at least getting enough",

          "I was enjoying the moment when I was at the bird park. Amazed with the atmosphere, lively birds flying across your side and I felt how lucky I am.",
          "One of the best attractions in KL. nice selection of birds and well laid out. Watch out for the Storks at feeding time which is done in an open pathway. the Storks (or at least one of them) bite. I was attached from behind and bitten 3 times in quick succession, all 3 bites",
          "We visited with a friend, many different birds and trees and decvoration was vcool! But i wouldn't go there again - the weather is hot, so walking is not joyful.. maybe for children it is more interesting!",
          "we were pleasantly surprised with the bird park. we walked from the butterfly park, easiest to access the bird park in grab or taxi. I thought the entry price was very fair for how big the park is for sure!! lots of birds wandering around, lots in their own enclosures. some",
          "It was a good attractions to be go when visit KL. However the bird type was really less, the bird show was only a parrot to perform the normal show. I was over expectation before visit. The park need to improve for the overall facilities. Like let in the penguin, some special",
          "It's very beautiful. And it's complete if you watch the bird show. So plan your visit here accordingly based on it. It takes about 1-3 hours duration to explore.",
          "I highly recommend family with young kids to visit this place, I wouldn't mind to visit it again and again!!",
          "I am not a fan of caged anything but this bird park has gone to great lengths to presetn the best environment possible for caged birds. The show could do with some enhancements.",
          "Loved the place! Many wide variety of birds in a beautiful place! Small bridges and waterfalls and colorful birds, for someone from a desert like country, this was heavenly!",
          "I had a funny feeling that I was going tobe disappointed with the KL Bird park - and I was sadly proved right. Firstly the 63 RGTS entrance fee (!)..ridiculously overprice particularly for Malaysia..well maybe if it is a really nice bird park with lots of exotic creatures,",
          "An absolute must! There are so many things to see here and Parrots climbing all over you! An absolute favorite",
          "It\u2019s a nice and lovely places to go and visit as it has all type of birds and it\u2019s a nice time to get out of the city and enjoy the nature.",
          "If you looking for natural scenery in KL, national botanical garden will be your choice. With bird park, butterfly park and deer park within walking distance. Will fill your day with enjoyable natural life.",
          "This is one of the most attraction of kul where you can get wide varity of birds, you will know about bird growth and behaver and how they fly",
          "We were walking through the lake gardens and found this place. Sells itself as the world\u2019s biggest free-flying aviary. Huge site with lots of birds. Mostly we saw storks, but there were also many others. Although you are given a map, the signage and routes are unclear so it\u2019s a",
          "Vast Area with lot of birds. you can see wide variety of birds there, worth place for children and family",
          "The Kuala Lumlur bird park was one of many highlites of our visit. Easy walk for us old folk and a great variety of birds to watch and enjoy.",
          "We had a lovely time wandering through the park, so many different types of birds, some I have never seen before, a lot of hornbills. The waterfall atrium was wonderful. well worth a visit.",
          "Really liked this park...the birds were friendly and plenty of variety in as natural a surrounding you could get in a city..good walk with plenty of ups and downs...highly recommend",
          "Went with my Thai friend, as it is one of the top attraction for tourist. The overall park is huge, but poor maintenance and no clear direction. Cleaniness was not that great too, old looking place, definitely need some serious reno to keep up with the number of people that come",
          "First visit to Kl bird park . Never thought that it\u2019s quite fun. Recommend to have a one day trip here as KL botanic garden just near by ~",
          "This is my second visit, first was 3 year back. The condition of park is not in good shape compared to what i enjoyed 3 years back. There are many peacock and Flemingo. Hope to see the situation improving. If you are a tourist then for the money you pay return on investment is",
          "This is a must visit for any tourists coming to KL. It\u2019s chilled and there aren\u2019t the typical wardens coming to tell you what you shouldn\u2019t be doing. The birds are mostly free as it\u2019s the largest aviary in the region. Plenty of foliage so it\u2019s very cool as well. The photo",
          "Reasonable price. Some birds seem happy and have a large area to roam however the emu's and owls enclosures weren't very good, which wasn't nice to see. There is a good variety of bird to see though and some pretty scenery. Take water with you as you can be there for hours.",
          "Was not a big fan a birds before my visit, but the parrots were super cool. Absolutely recommended, especially for groups.",
          "Kuala Lumpur bird park is one of the places that are nice to visit. However, the place is rather vast so if you are bringing a young child even if they are 3 years plus, I would suggest bringing a stroller along or you will end up carrying your child.",
          "At first glance this place looks like quite a nice enclosure for the birds, until you get inside. A lot of the bigger birds had tiny enclosures and cages which was quite upsetting to see. There were emus in a really small fenced off area which were almost bald due to losing",
          "It felt like Jurassic Park with birds. We had a great time but it was hot! We wrote a review on our blog randrwander if you are interested in seeing a bunch of pics of the birds! Cheers",
          "Mind the weather. The woman on the counter was reluctant to sell us tickets because there was a thunder storm brewing and rightly so, it seems people have gone in the past and have complained and wanted a refund because of bad weather. IT IS OUTDOORS. We knew it was going to",
          "Love the concept of the open-air aviary. Looks like the park could use a little more staff for maintenance, but saw otherwise a nice way to spend a few hours. We didn't arrive till afternoon due to morning rain and had to leave before seeing everything, so allow plenty of time",
          "An interesting morning walk through the KL bird park amongst landscaped gardens with many species all around. I thoroughly enjoyed the overall experience.",
          "Was perfect day with us . The whole family members enjoyed birds and feeding them. This place like paradise we wish all to have . The only negative point was the rain . If it rains you can't find all places covered but some. We got wet and hopefully we're not sick after writing",
          "I really enjoyed my time at the Bird Park. I went early in the morning, so the place was not very crowded and the birds were very active. I loved seeing all the animals interacting in a more natural manner. It was great to watch them fly or stroll down the pathways. I think kids",
          "I went to KL Bird Park wz my friend fr Holland. I recommended the place because they love bird watching and nature place. Overall, they said the place was okey but need more local spp. Make the area more green, plant more tree... Ficus tree fr example",
          "The park was really hard to find by foot, we found ourselves almost walking around the entire park (huge) just trying to find the entrance. It was an amazing experience once we finally got in!",
          "This place was lovely to get out of the huddle and bustle. A good place for the little ones to enjoy for a few hours. Only disappointing thing was that we kept seeing the same type of birds. They didn\u2019t have much of a selection 3/4 main ones.",
          "Tame birds with wide variety. Different habitats for different birds. Within city limits. Bring a wide brim hat.",
          "This is more like an open zoo. Good to see lot of species of birds freely moving around. The place is big and requires lot of walking . Overall it's a good place and would require 2 hr atleast. The entry is little expensive ~65 RM.",
          "A lot of the birds are allowed to roam free or in big spaces and they have lots of different birds to see. I had a great day despite a massive storm in the middle of my visit. It isn't cheap to get in, around 60, so for a backpacker it was quite a lot.",
          "Many birds flying / walking around oblivious to people , in a rainforest setting, so a very impressive place to visit... just about the right size for a 2 hour visit",
          "One of the most incredible nature experiences I've ever had. Was genuinely moved by the beauty and activity of the species. They have a good space to move around. Children would fall in love with this place but adults should too.",
          "We popped in as it was one of the stops on the Garden Leg of the Hop on Hop off Bus Tour. Ticket prices were reasonable. There are many sections to the park so give yourself a good 2-3 hours to see it all. Plenty of photo opportunities and you can pay to have photos with a few",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Bird Park. Birds looked well fed and seemed to be having fun while we were there. So tame, Some just sit beside you. Lots of interesting varieties.",
          "Lovely bird park with many different kinds to see , it is well maintained but i do agree with other comments about having some staff around to make sure the birds not being harassed by visitors for photo opportunities, would also agree that some of the cages are to small for",
          "Excellent bird park with a huge range of beautiful birds. Overall the park is well maintained, there is good information at each enclosure and many opportunities to interact with the birds - feeding them / photo area etc. Allow around 2-3 hours to get round it all, its very",
          "Fantastic bird park with so many types of beautiful birds, but there needs to be better monitoring and policing of visitors as we saw many people harassing the birds / peacocks for their entertainment and to get a photo shot. Whilst I appreciate this is not the fault of the bird",
          "Beautifully mainted. Reasonable entry fee; lots to see. Almost all the male peacocks through a dance!",
          "Quite simply a marvellous half day activity. We defected from our tour to see this and were amazed. A shame few other westerners there. Huge variety of birds, all seemingly very happy and well looked after in a huge and multi layered environment. Very well laid out , a gentle 2",
          "This bird park is huge and full of a range of birds. There are lots of opportunities to feed the birds and take photos really close to them. I would recommend to any one trying to escape the busy city for a while.",
          "Took a short taxi ride from the city using GRAB.It's cheap and easy to get there and back. The park is very big and has plenty of birds to keep you happy for a couple of hours. Well worth a visit in the morning.",
          "This birdpark is worth to spend at least half day with kids. Many kinds of bird we usually can't see elsewhere but can view from this park. Highly recommended.",
          "We have managed to see a little peacock walking close to his mom all the time. Male peacocks are everywhere and so beautiful I can\u2019t.",
          "Very good natural place with a lots of birds. Transport can be problem there. Better to call grab a car",
          "The park is home to lots of different birds and is clearly popular. The visit itself was enjoyable in the most part but I suspect we were judging it from a western perspective in that we were surprised at the lack of space some birds had as well as the site looking a little",
          "We enjoyed seeing all the birds walking/flying free around us . Great experience for all ages. You can spend easily hours inside. The only minus is the overpriced toy shop i side.",
          "For those that love birds, this is the place to go. They have amazing varieties, mainly from Asia and South America. For two ringlets you can feed the parrots. I had five of them all over me as I had the food. Very colorful, very pretty. The bird show was fun to see as well,",
          "this place to kids so if kids with you visit this entry fees is very high 63 rm not mush to see there",
          "This place could do with a bit of a makeover. Rather too spread out and a really tourist trap with very high entry fee (RM 63) for what it is. 2 questions.....what the heck is there a fish foot spa joint doing in a park like this and why do they make you pay a fee to even get a",
          "Spacious, vast canopy covered area of tree covered walking paths with a huge variety of mainly free-flying birds with plenty of space to fly. The cramped and sparse living conditions of the various birds which are housed in separate small aviaries lacking any greenery were sad",
          "My kids loved the visit to bird park! They enjoyed feeding the birds most as well as participating in the bird show. We got a bit tired as it's quite hot no matter when you visit - be sure to stay hydrated.",
          "Well laid out and resting seats inbetween! Park accessible, restaurants difficult for knee trouble! Too many steps. Nevertheless well worth a visit to see Malaysia\u2019s exotic birds close up.",
          "For 60MYR per person it's perhaps a little over priced for what it is, but still worth a little day out. Nothing overly special, but a good fun day out for a couple or family. Plenty to see and really big to walk around. The bird show was again nothing special but good fun. I",
          "There are two zone in the park, one side with birds not under captivating. There are a lot of peacocks and fish eating birds that will offer to be your tour guide. Do be careful if you have you kids with you. Do not let the kids hold smal object in hands as the bird may mistaken",
          "The kids might not even notice the smell of poo left by the hundreds of spectacular birds species because they will only be too excited to see them wandering up close but I guess you have to suck it up \ud83d\ude05 Don\u2019t forget to bring along a hand sanitizer, water to hydrate and a cap.",
          "We had a mixed view of our visit here. The main park is ok and there are birds flying around and lots of peacocks. Unfortunately, there are some birds kept in small cages. These birds, including hornbills and eagles, do not have space to fly and it\u2019s quite depressing. If you are",
          "Walk on the wild side in this gorgeous bird park where most of the thousands of birds roam freely. It\u2019s a sight and sound to behold! You can also buy food to feed the carp. The shows are fun too.",
          "Big, well-kept garden and bird enclosure. We had a relaxing walk through the park. Nice little bird show.",
          "This was our most expensive excursion when in KL and the very dissapointing. There were quite a lot of birds in cages which also seem very small especially the eagles. We missed the feeding of the eagles which when I saw the size of the cage they were in, I was glad as it would",
          "This park is so well put together, the exhibits a fabulous. Many birds walk along with you as you traverse the park. They are very well taken care of and there are so many birds to see. A photographers dream particularly if you are a bird watcher. 4 of us spent the day there",
          "It's a good experience to visit the Bird Park which had good reviews. Thank you for having us. However, I was disappointed when I saw how small the eagles enclosure was. It's similar to a human prison! The eagles, understandably, have wide-spread wings and didn't have enough",
          "I was with my wife and children, due to closeness to nature, my little girl got afraid, as she thought the birds may harm her hhhahaha.. well preserved park, with serve offer. Must visit and it offers a good walk",
          "Amazing place where you can mingle with animals. Anyone on KL should visit this place for the wonderful feeling that you can touch, feed and feel the animals.",
          "Took a while to get to Park via Hop on Hop off bus, would recommend taxi. Wonderful time wandering amongst the birds. Particularly loved the Hornbill, and had opportunity to feed him with papaya and beef. So gentle ! Also loved the show with the parrots and ducks showing off!",
          "We spent several hours walking among the bird that freely stroll or fly through their sections of the grounds, or peering at the ones that must remain sequestered. There was an amusing bird show, and elsewhere an opportunity to hold a cup of liquid food and allow beautiful",
          "For non Malaysian you have to pay a little bit more. But it is with the price. You will see thousands of birds many in freedom and others in spacious enclosure. Not only most Malaysian species but a variety of birds from different parts of the world. I am not a fan of zoo and",
          "This is a real wonder. The KL Bird Park is a beautiful, if a little aged, zoo just for birds. It\u2019s not big, but provides a wonderfully peaceful getaway from the city, so close by. Much of the bird park is under a net canopy, the \u201cworld\u2019a largest walk in aviary\u201d. This alone is",
          "We loved this park. Many birds are freely walking around. Some birds you can feed and they come to your arm. The park is nicely mantained. Would love to come again!",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours, were were surprised at the size of the park and number of birds there. had a reasonable lunch in the restaurant.",
          "Enjoyed with kids. Still need alot of improvement such as cleaness of the water in the lake. Tickets price reasonable. Parking need to add more space. Food very expensive.",
          "The birds are wonderful. There\u2019s lots of opportunity to feed them and get close. It\u2019s a wonderful shady place to visit on a hot day. Do be careful when you are under trees. Resting birds above you like to poop! Be forewarned. It\u2019s easy to walk around the park, and it would be a",
          "Huge place with lots of birds who seemed well cared for and very relaxed. Most bird have lots of space to roam around and some of the interactive feedings are good fun .",
          "This is one of our favourite places to visit when we are in KL. The park is well laid out with many free-flying species around. In other areas, birds are in largish cages. A huge net is pulled over a small reasonably steep valley to make the park. It takes a little bit of energy",
          "We came across the bird garden by chance when we were planning to visit the Botanical Gardens, which is nearby. It is also near the museum.We had a very relaxing morning admiring the vast array of beautiful birds, many of which fly freely. There is also a small children\u2019s play",
          "It was alright, nothing spectacular. And very disappointed the man guard is very rude and impolite to us just because my husband took off his wristband because i put it too tight on him. Definetely wouldn\u2019t come back! Bali bird park is a lot better than in KL.",
          "You must visit KL Bird Park as you never find a better environment here close to the nature of bird and forest and the well kept environment and once of the well know bird park in the world. Windy and comfortable place where kids and family find it a best place to hang out for",
          "Went with toddlers and kids, they had so much fun, especially the bird show!. Overall shady but do make sure you have sunscreen and hats for the kids. Drinks are sold everywhere so make sure you are hydrated too! Baby stroller friendly.",
          "The bird park is the largest free-flying bird park. There are four zones, each housing different birds, flying and non-flying or flightless birds, in their own natural habitats. We move from one zone to another through double doors, so that the birds roam only in their own",
          "it is a nice bird park, with various bird,well treaten. its a very nice bird park to bring along your kids and also family to walk along in the morning/evening. with some educative spot and animal feed, good for the kids",
          "What a unique experience to walk among the birds. It was lovely to see the birds upclose. The birds were used to humans so were not aggressive just dont eat anything with them (you will have to share). My two year old was captivated. Its quite a walk and lots of slopes too so we",
          "Aviary claims to the biggest covered space with birds free flying. It is filled with cages and some have such fine mesh that birds can not be well seen. I am not an ormitologist , but for a price I was rather disappointed. The only fantastic bird in my opinion was a snow white",
          "A nice way to spend a few hours with children. Some of the enclosures seem rather inadequate for some of the birds, whilst others were very generous. The hornbills were very intriguing and entertaining.",
          "We got to see rare birds. Especially loves seeing the owls however, didnt like the parrot picture trick as the poor parrots werent treated well.",
          "i visited this place with my child and wife, this is great place for family person , you need minimum 3-4 hour to visit this place, lovely place , love to visit again",
          "This place is beautiful to see full of colourful birds. The bird shows are conducted twice a day one at 12.30 and other at 3. It lasts for just 15 mins. But nice.i felt the bird shows in Singapore were even more better.",
          "The place is very big and there are large number of birds too.the place I don't find too clean. Most of of the free birds are peacock or pigeons. Bird show was awesome. It was really great to see birds doing tricks.",
          "It is a nice place, and probably is especially good for families. We were with our adult children and two young grandchildren who were too young to really enjoy the birds, but they did love the playground.",
          "My family member enjoy the photo both but their expectation was not fulfill ,So far I understand that the display system could not satisfied them .May be the idea is good for research work but the person's who visit along with kids want some enjoyable display .",
          "As Malaysia goes this is an expensive 1 hour walk around, yes a large aviary, but with very little flying around. A lot of peacocks and storks, with not much else. If you are stuck for an hour and want to spend 63rm each then go and ensure you take mossy spray etc Could actually",
          "Well worth a visit to the bird park. We enjoyed the layout and the amount of birds wandering along the pathways. Watch the baby chics hatching. Lots of photo opportunities.",
          "Great place to pass the day at your own leisure, will be back once my kids arrive from the UK simply wonderful",
          "Claimed to be the largest covered bird part in the world with free flying birds all over the place. However many birds are in separate cages including the large hornbills. Lots of peacocks wandering around. But particularly enjoyable was the free 12.30 bird show where several",
          "If you do nothing else in Kuala Lumpur you must do this. You will never have been so close to so many amazing species' of birds. They are all around you. This is well worth it.",
          "A wonderful time spent here watching the birds. Young kids will love seeing some of the birds moving in open. Especially the peacocks,ducks etc. Some walking to do.Wear comfortatble walking shoes.And don't forget your hats.They do have ascess for prams /wheel chairs. So ,give a",
          "The moment I entered the sanctuary, my jaw dropped to the ground and my eyebrows were raised to the sky. To be so up close and personal with so many species of birds under one roof was so out of this world. If it wasn\u2019t for the humans around me, I would have thought I was in",
          "This is a big beautiful open aviary. I think it is among the largest in the world. It is peaceful and fascinating. There is a tremendous variety of birds. One of my favorite things was watching weaver birds flying in and making their nests Great for all ages.",
          "You'll see a variety of birds flying in the aviary. Some in enclosure. the best place to be. Definitely must visit if you're in KL. My 5th time :D",
          "We went for the second time (after a first and fondly remembered visit in 2011). While the huge price hike since then now makes this by far the most expensive attraction in KL at 63 RM per adult, the place is showing signs of disrepair in many spots, and it seems that some",
          "The park is totally enclosed therefore there a good opportunities to see birds that you wouldn\u2019t normally see in the city. Several species are caged in fairly undesirable enclosures. It could be better presented and maintained.",
          "We went here by mistake thinking it was the butterfly park. The price is a little steep. Sure, the birds are beautiful and amazing to look at, but their captivity saddens the soul. The park itself is quite big but you can tell the animals just want out. They do have a wide range",
          "This is a very nice place to visit esp f you love birds, bird are everywhere, especially peacocks! Though some birds are caged (like eagles and owls) almost most birds are free. I just hope they maintain it since some areas are not so well maintained, esp the ponds. I love the",
          "I went here to kill time while I was on a work trip but I must confess that once I got past the surprising entrance fee (65 MR) it was a really nice break from the concrete which dominates most of central KL. My kids would have liked it around the ages 5-7 I reckon and",
          "We visited the Bird Park when we stayed at KL this year. It was an extremely enjoyable experience. So fabulous to be surrounded by all these sounds and colours. So many peacocks and herrons and bulbuls and swans and much much more. All very friendly and cramming to be",
          "nice place. beautiful place. well maintained park. ticket is expensive to see bird park for foreigner",
          "There are a lot of verity of species of birds here. They all are well kept and well feed. Crew here also very nice, they introduce to me their birds species one by one and they offer me drinks too. Thanks again for the treat. Will definitely come back again for another visit.",
          "I came down here with my partner to visit and get closer to the birds. This place is maintained and clean from my sight of view unlike other bird parks you visit to. We had fun watching the tricks by the birds and of course got the eye catching moment of the peacocks who were",
          "Worth visiting. This is one the well maintained bird park I\u2019ve seen around the world. Kids loving it a lot. Birds are freely flying around, and they got a huge space. We can walk around the park to see them all. During feeding time, you can feed the birds too. From the city,",
          "I honestly don't really like birds, and I visit the park because.... It was alright, not really my favorite as not like I expected (I thought I might see pink flamingos!) but the bird shows was amazing, that the highlight of the park really.",
          "It's not well maintain and WHERE'S THE BIRD. Smell terrible and not worth the money. Tbh I really do hope the management spend more time to take care of this place.",
          "Went to this place with low expectations and I can honestly say it blew me out of the water! I was with a group of friends and we spent a few hours there, it was like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. In zoos you feel like you are on the outside looking in, but at the bird",
          "This is a must visit attraction for tourist and locals alike, a popular family and a photographer's heaven. It is located near the Police Headquaters and Perdana Botanical Gardens. You can see all types of birds and can feed them with your hand. Nice place to take a stroll. You",
          "When you're travelling with family and children, this destination is worthwhile. The bird park is located inside the Perdana Botanical Garden (15 mins from bukit bintang). There you'll have options to visit other parks (deer park, butterfly park, etc) after visiting the Bird",
          "Very attractive and relaxing place for people of all ages. Well maintained. Photos with peacocks will be remembered for life.",
          "This is a descent to a refreshment area (you may need to take a bottle of water with you) and a long circular walk around a sort of valley and lake filled with birds. There are also cages with eagles, Ostriches and the like. But the best thing is that these birds are quite at",
          "We spent 2h30 there , it\u2019s true it\u2019s very big, certainly the world free flying bird cage, but for what ? We saw few bird flying there, mostly the most commun ones , on the ground or in water, lot of peonies. Even the parrots are in small cages. Nice place , very green and quiet",
          "So expensive and the crowds flock here. Highlight is on the edge. Hawksbill cafe. Food is fine and service is excellent, so quick.",
          "Presented as one of the largest aviaries in the world, we were disappointed with this place, which is characterized by a lack of maintenance, maintenance and recent investments: lawns and grass beds are not carved and maintained; the ponds are dirty and the water is green and",
          "My son and wife and of course me enjoyed the park. We were able to see and take photos of different species of birds.",

          "Sorry to have visited the bird park. It's whole purpose appears to be for human entertainment and nothing about the welfare of the birds or educating the public. Ostrich, eagles and owls kept in unsatisfactory habitats. Would not recommend if you're into bird welfare and",
          "I enjoyed every single moment I spent there. The birds are walking around, and the organization is good. There are also beautiful waterfalls, and you will also see monkey (watch you things, baby monkies can pick them and run out of curiosity). Super recommended.",
          "We enjoyed a few hours wandering around this park. Caught the bird show which was entertaining for the kids and a feeding session. All up a very nice and saw some wonderful birds.",
          "The KL is very large, and it's well maintained, so it's easy to get around and see everything. You can easily spend hours in the park, so although the admission price is quite steep, it's worth it. We particularly enjoyed seeing the peacocks roaming around the park and also",
          "Established in 1991, the KL Bird Park is home to the world\u2019s largest free flight walk-in aviary: so large, really, that once inside, we pretty much forgot that we were under a vast net along with some three thousand birds. While not as big (or well-maintained, or even as",
          "If you are planning for Malaysia than I would suggest this place for all age group people. I liked it very much and I enjoyed so much there.",
          "(I mostly saw Egrets and Peacocks). A large forest and park featuring eagles, lovebirds, owls, ostriches, etc. I just don't like seeing birds in captivity, even if they are well-fed and have enough room to fly around. There are still nets and cages.",
          "This was a little bit pricey for walking around and looking at birds. That said you can get very close to the birds, and in one area, even hold them and feed them. It takes about 1 and a half hours.",
          "Wow, just wow. I was really impressed by the size and number of birds here. And the birds are everywhere, you literally should be careful do to do not step on them :-) We saw many peacocks, parrots, pelicans, cranes, ducks and etc. We also saw eagles, ostriches and even owls! I",
          "A great way to experience a multitude of tropical birds in as close to a free environment as possible. Some birds that you may never have a chance to see. Also a good family outing.",
          "We have been impressed with all the things we have some in Malaysia often are better than expected and that goes for the bird park as well. Great photo ops, there are even a few monkeys in the park. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours. Also one of the few places open on",
          "I came here with a friend and at first when we arrived, we were a tad bit surprised that the entry ticket price was quite exy (MYR 63 per person). Then we found out that for local, it's only MYR 25. The park has a lot of peacocks. If you're a peacock lover, you'll find this a",

          "We loved to see all the birds in the park. We also went to the Butterfly Park, Deer park and Orchid & Hibiscus Gardens nearby - all were very enjoyable.",
          "This is probably more suited to families. A \"walk through \" park where some of the birds roam free. Probably best during the cooler morning or late afternoon.",
          "A huge bird park one of the biggest i have seen if not the biggest. Just a little disorganised, they say this is Malaysia Lah, but sometime its frustrating when a place like this could cater for non muslims as well....... But don't be put off the kids will still love it.....",
          "The park isn't far away from the National Mosque and Gallery. It is easily reached from these sites. The Bird Park was fun, with some many friendly birds just strolling bye you, without any fear. Do give yourself about 3 hours to get around and try come a little early as we",
          "We have been a few years ago in this same Bird Park and because it was already that time a good experience so we are here again. It's nice park where you can get really near a lot of different birds, you can get even your own photo with birds on your head and hands. I can",
          "I had doubts about visiting this park as it was quite hot but glad we went. It is one of the highlight of our trip to KL. Many birds to see...peacocks, crowned pigeons, ibis, owls, hornbills, swan, ducks, stork, pelican. They are roaming around. Some birds are in cages also.",
          "Yep, the KL Bird Park is an amazing spot if you are a fan of nature and amazing birds. Do take some sunscreen and hats to protect yourself from the sun. You\u2019ll definitely be amazed by the colorful birds.",

          "One of the most interesting things to do in KL is visiting the Bird Park. I don't go to any zoo because I don't like animals in cages, but KL Bird Park is not like that. Free birds are roaming among you as soon as you enter and some will even follow you. Although some birds are",
          "An average outing for families, was not impressed by the park. The park really has to be better maintained. For the price per person it is not value for money.",
          "This place advertises free \"roaming\" birds. But over 2/3 of its collection is caged. You will see mostly the same birds as in any small zoo The only one worth the visit for me was the hornbill It is also a bit pricey: 63 ringgit per person.",

          "The bird park has a large selection of tropical birds. It is a good size and easy to walk around if you can stand the intense heat with no shade. The caf\u00e9 just by the park is very good both for a meal or a snack and issir conditioned",
          "They have put a lot of effete into building this park. We noticed a lot of staff working / working around but appears no one wants to get there hands dirty and pick up rubbish you would think they have build the park on top of an old refuge tip",
          "My wife and I had a nice visit here at the weekend and although the massive open aviary was really good to see and plenty of birds, there were still some birds in small cages. Overall worth a visit though.",
          "Birds are free in the cage and the bird show was pretty entertaining. Good place to visit, a bit of a walk.. but worth it..",
          "The visit was interesting - it was spacious and the were a lot of bird species displayed. I was, however, disappointed for three reasons: 1) the ticket price was steep for what was offered, 2) this place was marketed to us as the largest open-air aviary in the world - instead,",
          "Park is good, but not as expected comparing the price. A lot of birds and specially peacocks. My kids like it though.",
          "Combined it with a walk around the Hibiscus Garden which are just opposite so made for a good afternoons visit. Many of the birds you can photograph as they wander freely. Others are obviously in cages so photography not so easy. But good to see a lot of South Asian birds",
          "We loved this place. Such a unique experience walking amongst the beautiful birds and being able to feed them - some great photo opportunities! The park gets quite busy but if you get there early then it shouldn't be a problem. Lovely place to spend the day, very kid friendly",

          "A popular and beautiful public aviary in the city of Kuala Lumpur. The Bird park houses thousands of birds and is a very popular tourist attraction in the city. It is located close to the National Mosque. Accessible using the KL Rapid Pasar Seni station and the KL station of KTM",
          "The bird park fills an afternoon but really just a few birds in a few cages - my opinion = average, not sure if worth the RM63 price",
          "Huge, beautiful and calm place with hundreds of species of birds to watched. One can get opportunity to take photographs with multiple birds. One can learn a lot about these birds, including their feeding pattern, breeding pattern, colors, chirps, habitat patterns, etc.",
          "A lovely place to spend a couple of hours. Lots of interaction with the birds and a good variety. Was a bit disappointed by the lack of toucans, which are quite prevalent in the marketing.",

          "It's very rare to have a chance to see all these birds up close, they are use to humans, and do not run away or attack. I wouldn't try and pet them, but still can get some great photographs. There are multiple types of birds and the property is large enough to wander around for",
          "There is a lot of birds in open area, they walk around you, children were glade. The show was perfectly organized and understandable for non English speaking.",
          "Big sign posts of the birds. Nice, leafy green area to walk around. Auditorium for the bird show was not big enough (maybe because it was school holidays there were too many people) and it was quite hot. Microphone had static. Could use more funding to improve the background of",

          "If you've never been to a bird park you might enjoy it, but compared to Jurong bird park in Singapore for example this was not even close. The admission fee of 63RM for adults was really expensive for what you got for your money. The park was not that big and the animals were",
          "I\u2019d say that in this place there are lucky and unlucky birds. The peacocks, for example, have a good life here -except for having to deal with some disrespectful visitors- because they can walk, eat and enjoy the place freely... but the owls are forced to be there in a loud",
          "KL Bird's Park is an overrated attraction. The price of 64 RM per person is far too much for what you get. Local birds are beautiful, they fly and walk mostly freely, but the general condition of the park is poor. There are some birds in bad situation (like owls tied and trying",
          "If you visit KL with kids, chances are you won't miss this site. Named after the country's second prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak Heritage Park is most famous for the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, which attracts adults too, especially those who like taking pictures of birds. The",
          "There are not too many great places to visit in KL. This was definitely worth to pay the high entrance fee. I would say, it was interesting not only for kids, but also for us. Well kept and clean, birds flying/walking around. My son watched 40 minutes how chicken are hatching.",
          "I brought my 4 months old son to kl bird park during school holiday, thinking to let him experience the nature. The entrance fees rm25 for adult and rm12 for kids 3 years and above is not mistaken. The park is well maintained. The landscape is nice. My son enjoyed the bird show",
          "We have visited the KL bird park in Dec 2018 as our kid likes birds and animals a lot. The park had many different kinds of birds but there was none to explain or share more information about the birds. The boards were also missing or I did not look at the correct places.",
          "Loved the bird park. You can get a 10% discount if you download a voucher from their web site. The park is well kept and very easy to walk around with a buggy - well designed. Really enjoying walking along side the peacocks and other beautiful birds. They also have feeding",

          "Went on a weekday mid morning. Not very crowded and plenty of opportunity to see all the birds. A lot of storms and pelicans. Few horn bills. The hornbill restaurant is ok. Quick service but food quality and tastes is not great. Overall it was worth the experience. I would go",
          "Without doubt the nicest place I have been to in KL! Maybe I am biased as I have a 4 year old. Maybe I like birds. Or maybe I like open spaces in the middle of concrete jungle but whatever it was it was fun. The tickets are a little steep but I think it was worth it. You need a",

          "The bird park is amazing with variety of many malaysian birds. Its a must visit place and perfect for kids.",
          "What a lovely little gem hidden in the perdana gardens vicinity. The Largest walk-in aviary will surprise you at every little turn you take inside with the ever courageous birds sneaking up on you left, right and center. Both kids and adults would love to spend time here.",
          "Large park with a variety of birds. Claims to be the largest in the world containing free-flying birds, and I can believe it. Displays of parrots performing occur throughout the day. I would have preferred for it to contain native species only but I guess some people appreciate",

          "This may be the largest walk-in aviary in the world, but it was simply not big enough to be home for more than 3000 birds. On entering the park, we were confronted by a multitude of peacocks, egrets, ibis, and pigeon being continually harassed by small children, and adults",
          "Nice attraction to go for a walk in between trees and lots of birds. I need to say I was expecting few more different kind of birds... but overall is cool. But if you just want to walk in between trees with not that many birds tha botanical garden next to it is even better.",
          "I spent half day there, much more time than suggested because I enjoyed taking photos of the birds. It was a pleasant tour, a lot of birds roaming free around, harmless. Love the environment, it was clean and not too hot. Didn't manage to see Rhinoceros Hornbill, a bit",
          "Well kept.. maps not as accurate. More signage would be good. More species of birds would be better too",
          "The park is small enough to finish exploring within 2 hours, excluding watching the bird show and having lunch at the HornBill Restaurant. However, it is still an amazing experience; most of the birds were roaming around instead of being held in cages. A fun place with potential",
          "The entry is quite expensive. But worth every penny! Make sure that you have enough time to enjoy the visit!",
          "It would take around 3-4 hours to complete roaming around the KL Bird Park. It is delightful to see how they are keeping the birds in the sanctuary, inside the city and that too providing adequate importance to nature and to the habitat of birds. Love visiting it again.",
          "This is a great place. It is a large park with lots of exotic birds. You get to walk among the birds in the huge aviary. It is amazingly well designed and maintained. The price is 63 MYR per adult, and well worth the price. We spent several hours here and thoroughly enjoyed",

          "For a local, I actually enjoy revisiting this place few times with family and some foreign friends. Walking into a huge aviary, you do not feel like you are in a cage at all. Birds have big space to fly around and they are very friendly with visitors. But PLEASE do not attempt",

          "We had a great day here. My favourite part of it was feeding the birds. The hornbills were a must - test your aim throwing up to the rhinoceros hornbill or feed the great hornbill directly and be amazed by how gently it takes the pieces of fruit. The parrots were impressive too,",
          "Excellent place for animal lovers. With the fee that they are charging to the visitors, I hope (and pray) that they will not waiver in looking after the welfare of the birds in the park. Also, I hope they can take a closer look to those visitors who are disturbing the peace of",

          "The bird park is over priced which I wouldn\u2019t have minded if they were using the money to keep the Park pristine. However, one of the lakes which was pristine had no birds in it, instead they were all crowded into the other water source which was dirty. Part of the park seemed",
          "Beautiful birds in this sanctuary, although it was a bit sad to see some of them in the heat of the day, and missing feathers which could be a clear sign of stress due to their captivity and conditions. Although it seems they are being taken care of to the best of The park\u2019s",
          "Must visit especially with kids. Was a bit humid but worth it. Peacocks rome around freely. A well maintained aviary. Amazing views",
          "I can say the place is quite well maintained. the place is huge, took us almost half a day So many species to see, some birds are kept in cage but most of them fly freely. You can also feed the birds and fishes there. Fish food can be bought at the machine (make sure you have",

          "I'm a bird lover so enjoyed this!! Its reasonably priced and all set under a massive net enclosed area. Most birds are free to fly and roam. But I noticed that some of the emu's and ostriches were stressed in small enclosures, not good.",
          "Really beautiful park with lots of amazing and exotic birds. Some of them were in cages but many just flying or walking about among people. We got really close to some pretty peacocks. Great experience for any ages!",
          "Worth to visit when you're in KL. Birds are everywhere and flying around. They have bird performance as well!",
          "We signed up for the annual pass so we visit whenever we want to. It's always fun to walk in the midst of the greens and fresh air. Kids are able to enjoy the free flying and walking birds and you can even buy the Bird / fish food to feed them...",

          "KL Bird Park has been operating since 1991 and it's worth a visit when you're in KL. While not up to standard to Jurong Bird Park Singapore, there are enough variety of birds that young kids would definitely enjoy the experience. The park is divided into 4 zones and it's easy",
          "This was my second visit to the Bird Park - and since my first visit 5 years ago things have sadly gone down hill. The paths were very slippery and everything seemed tired and not well maintained. There are still some lovely birds and monkeys to see and I especially liked",
          "Visited in september . Used to be a lot better some years back. Even the hornbills enclosure is nearly non existent . The area for birds arr now less . And we have to pay more ? The fact that you can finish seeing everything in less than 40 min explains a lot. Its way too costly",
          "The park is an impressive sight being the largest open/ netted aviary in the world. Costa are about 50 ringits per adult 30 per child. Zones 1 and 2 are by far the best with wide open spaces and plenty of native bird life living and flying in very open spaces. I was much",
          "All I will say is make sure to go there, wife and I went it was really nice! It rained a little before we went which really enhanced our experience, felt like we were in the middle of a rainforest with all the different birds, worth every penny visiting this place. I would say",
          "It was once great, but like the mouldy, decayed, stuffed parrots on one of the displays, the park needs money and attention. Sure it's large and spacious but the number of species available to see is relative minor. The famed hornbills locked behind heavy metal mesh that makes",
          "This is a great place to visit. There is a wide range of species and the displays are very well done. The entry price is a little high but not too extreme.",

          "I came here with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that it was an OK experience. It was over priced for what it was. There are really interesting birds there, and they seem well looked after. There is a cute bird show as well. Overall, nothing speacil, but a way to kill time, and",

          "I love birds and have been coming to the KL Bird Park for twenty years. The scale of the covered area where birds can fly free and the number of birds are amazing, and it is a treat to be able to get so close to so many kinds of birds. The range of habitats is well planned,",

        "wiki": "Perdana Botanical Gardens, formerly Perdana Lake Gardens, Lake Gardens and Public Gardens, is Kuala Lumpur's first large-scale recreational park. Measuring 91.6 hectares, it is located in the heart of the city and established in 1888. The park served as place of refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city during colonial times. It contains large sculpted and manicured gardens and a host of attractions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe colonial-era park was the brainchild of Alfred Venning, the British State Treasurer of Selangor in the late 19th century. In 1888, Venning proposed that a botanical garden be built in the valley of Sungei Bras Bras, and the British Resident Frank Swettenham agreed to the scheme and authorised a small grant from the State funds for the garden. Venning laid out the plan for a park of 173 acres (700,000 m2) which included an \"experimental economic garden\", cleared the area of scrubs and lalang, and planted ornamental flowering trees and shrubs. The scheme attracted public support, and a leading figure of the Cantonese community, Towkay Chow Ah Yeok, contributed a hundred chempaka and orange trees to the initial planting programme in 1888. An ornamental lake was created by damming up Sungei Bras Bras, which was then named Sydney Lake after Swettenham's wife (the lake is now known as Perdana Lake). The project took nearly ten years to complete, but the garden was formally opened on 13 May 1889, just a year after work began, by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Cecil Clementi Smith.\n\nThe official residence of the then British government representative Frank Swettenham, now known as Carcosa Seri Negara, was located atop a hill here. Venning also created a social club by the lake, the Lake Club (now known as the Royal Lake Club), in 1890. The club, unlike the Selangor Club, was an exclusively European club, and it would dominate the social scene for Europeans in Kuala Lumpur for over half a century. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament, which was built in 1963, is located on the northern fringes of the park.\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe park was initially called Public Gardens but later renamed Lake Gardens. In 1975, it was renamed Taman Tasik Perdana, or the Perdana Lake Gardens, by Tun Abdul Razak. On 28 June 2011, the gardens were renamed again to Perdana Botanical Gardens by Dato' Sri Najib Razak in the first phase of turning the park into a botanical garden.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe garden is located along Jalan Perdana or Venning Road. It is located near the National Museum of Malaysia. The nearest public transportation hub within walking distance is Muzium Negara MRT station. Another option is to take the RapidKL bus B112 from Pasar Seni LRT station. This will drop you at the National Museum which is at the edge of the park. It has a tunnel next to National Museum that you can access directly to the park. The gate will be open from 6:00 to 20:00 daily.\nAt the park, shuttle trams  are available daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (tickets: RM4 adults, RM2 children). Visitors can also rent bicycles for RM3/30 mins. Guided walks  are provided free of charge on Sundays, 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nAmong the tourist attractions located here are the National Monument, deer park, Hibiscus garden, Orchid Garden, Kuala Lumpur Bird Park and Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park. The Bird Park was opened in 1991, and features more than 200 species of bird. It is billed as the world's largest covered bird park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPerdana Botanical Garden Official website",

          "We spent a long day in this colorful park. Full of special trees, flowers, and wonderful plants. There is also different animals that you see when walking through the wonderful greenery areas. We got to see plants and animals that we have never seen before. There are small lakes",
          "The Perdana botanical gardens is a huge park in KL which can be a great place to go for a walk and admire the nature. There are many parks within the gardens. Entrance is free but some parks, like the bird park, charge a fee. It is a good idea to get a ticket for the day in one",

          "Very well kept. There are plenty of toilets around the site. Paved paths make it easy to walk around. The entry is free. There is a shop and cafe on site, with reasonable prices. The gardens are pretty.",
          "The place is immensely big. There's no access fee. Even though they keep the park in good condition,I don't see much people visiting there. Hence expect it to be bit lonely experience except for one or two tourists.Therefore it would be better to finish your tour before",
          "A lovely huge park, it's huge with lots of big trees, a few different zone. The kids playground is huge design for kids of all ages. Best to go early or late afternoon.",

          "This botanical garden (like most) is huge and we only covered a small area in about 2.5 hours (granted, we were taking photos etc). I would recommend going very early or later in the afternoon (after 4pm). If you go later, make sure to bring mosquito repellent or cover up. There",
          "A really nice botanical garden, but like evrywhere else in KL it is very difficult just to stroll about without getting very hot under the collar. Take plenty of water, and use the buggies that take you around for just a few pounds, it will certainly help you see the area in",
          "went with kids, had a good walk and hit the playground. very big place, we covered only 40% of it, try it, you will like it",
          "Can't recommend this beautiful park enough...so nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of KL for a few hours. Be sure to take the KL Tram to get around..only 15RM each hop on hop off ..it is a huge park and long distances between places of interest...there is an entrance",
          "We really enjoyed the botanical gardens although i agree with a lot of the comments that the place is difficult to find. We actually walked there from Merdeka Square which is a tough walk in 37 degree heat. We couldnt find the entrance and walked through the staff entrance like",
          "A huge place, it is easy to get lost in, especially as the signage is not the greatest! A nice way to spend a couple of hours out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Would be better if there was better signage and more maps. Also more information about the different flora and",
          "The place is so big, I don't have enough energy to explore all the places.Hehe. What I love the most is the unique rooftop design (great place for taking pictures) and the bamboo playhouse. Great places for joggers, also for children as they do provide specific playground that",
          "This visit was made much better by paying RM15 each to use the little golf cart type tram ride. The gardens are huge, but there are lots of attractions inside. We started off by the lake, with amazing topiary and fountains in the lake, a culinary garden and some interesting",
          "If you love nature, the parc, forrest, lakes and the feeling that you can wonder around for hours and hours.. You're in the right place. Don't forget to visit Lake Garden when you're in KL.",
          "Just so lovely to be able to walk free of charge through these huge gardens. Well worth combining with the Police Museum Islamic Museum/ Bird Park or National Museum which are all in the same area",
          "As stated the park is difficult to locate, easy to say it\u2019s behind the National museum but there are no sign posts and the entrance is through a underpass. I would recommend getting Grab to an entrance. That said the park is huge and worth visiting for a relaxing stroll. There",
          "We also struggled to find the \u201centrance to the park\u201d. Based on TA there are multiple entry points but not pay points so access is flexible. We had our Grab driver drop us at Tun Abdul Razak - but realized we weren\u2019t actually in the Botanical gardens . So we walked down to the",
          "A reprieve from the big city.A green oasis in the city center.Big park,another bit run down.You can spend around 1.5 hours wandering around.Better botanical gardens in Asia.Public toilets were dirty and run down.",
          "We visited this place in noon. In spite of KL's hot nature we loved this park for its greenery as it saved us from the heat too. It was a real treat to the eyes. People not interested in nature May not enjoy it much.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the park and garden. Staying at the Hilton, we simply crossed the street and walked through the Lake Park area and then into the botanical garden. It was well worth it. But best to do this in the morning before it gets too hot.",
          "Notwithstanding the rave reviews from 3rd world visitors, this botanical garden is a sore sight esp with broken benches and poorly maintained gardens in many aspects . Go take a leaf from Singapore Botanical Garden which is world class and world heritage site. The problems",
          "Really lovely oasis in a hot humid city. Bit confusing to find your way around as they have put unhelpful fences in inappropriate places. No real hassle though.",
          "Every time when I just want to have a relaxing walk in a beautiful setting, I will go to the Botanical Gardens in KL. Beautiful trees, plants, a lake and a nice view on KL Sentral. One big round is probably around 2km. Except during the big holidays, I never found it very busy.",
          "We visited the botanical gardens on our recent trip to KL. We decided to go on foot following a city map we had been given by our hotel, this was a big mistake. There is almost no signage and when we asked local people almost all of them had no idea what we were talking about",
          "Very peaceful escape from the busy KL. Lovely to have a walk through these peaceful gardens. Lots to see bad investigate. We went mid morning and this was a lovely time to see the garden!",
          "A superb and vast botanical park not far from the highways that surround it. Collection of fruit trees, orchid park, colelction of palm trees, etc., lovers of tropical flora will be delighted. The easiest access is from KL Sentral via Le M\u00e9ridien and Hilton parking. Free",
          "The garden or rather park area is designed to be visited by people in (airconditioned) cars with a superficial interest in nature. Access for pedestrians or even cyclists is cumbersome from the National Museum side as well as from the National Monument side. There are no",
          "This garden is like heaven on earth. This garden has ample amount of botanical variety. You must visit this place if you are in Malaysia.",
          "There are a few separate areas in the garden such as the orchid garden. Very little signage or information given. It\u2019s a pleasant enough place to walk around but I\u2019ve been in much better Botanic Gardens.",
          "The various themed areas are great, the planetarium is interesting and there are lots of museums to investigate. The cafe next to the gift shop just up from the bird area serves great food and very low prices.",
          "We went late afternoon having first enjoyed High Tea at the Majestic Hotel. Much cooler. Probably best to go early morning then have lunch and go back in the afternoon. We only managed to visit the Bird Park which was good. There us more to see. Worth a visit especially with",
          "If you are a backpacker looking for some exercise, this is the place! A good place for a jog, some fresh air in the city. It\u2019s right behind the National Museum as well! So you can pop in there when you are done for air conditioning and culture!",
          "nice place to run in the morning. A lot of people but not crowded.Safe to run in the mornings for ladies, havent seen any pervs there",
          "A nice 100+ year old park and ample parking and toilet facilities. Lots of tropical trees and a quaint place to relax or jog. Quite safe as there's security at the entrances with wide pathways.",

          "The Perdana Botanical Garden is beautiful the aroma and ambient makes it more fabulous. The garden consists tons of varieties of flowers.",
          "This is a beautiful garden. It is very large and well kept and lovely for a stroll if you can stand the intense heat.",
          "Nearby are the Orchid and Hibiscus gardens for flower enthusiasts. Also, the insects and butterflies are another interesting attraction. One has to take protection from the sun and be hydrated as 3-4 hours can be spent here.",
          "If you love nature, then this place should be in the top of your list. It is so big and green and you can just walk or ride the bike or roll. It is a fresh air in the middle of this crowdy city.",
          "Great to visit an amazing park right in the centre of a major city. Not only can you visit the park but close by is the butterfly and bird parks along with the Orchard and Hibiscus gardens. You may want to split the visit as we did.",
          "If you are looking for some natural wildlife that is not far from the city centre then this is the place to go, many species of butterflies, dragonflies, birds and home to the Malaysian Monitor Water Lizard. With lots of foliage and fauna to see a 3 hour visit should be ok. I",
          "This is a beautifully landscaped garden with lakes and good to spend an afternoon if you love nature. KL Bird Park is also close by. There is no entrance fee.",
          "We spent a couple of hours just exploring the park, and it is superb. It comprises a range of contrasting areas and all are worth checking out. A great activity on a quiet morning, but it can get warm in the heat of the day. Check out the opening and closing times.",
          "We walked from Chinatown to the gardens which is a hike, especially in 30 degree heat and humidity but it was worth it. This green haven is a quiet peaceful spot. So much to see over and above the plantings. Worth a mornin* visit.",
          "It was very hot and humid when we visited but that probably goes without saying. There are some shady spots under the trees. Lots of plants and interesting trees. Look out for the cannon ball trees. Very interesting. Look up into the trees and you may see the black monkeys.",
          "Walking or running around the lake. Cooling down among the flowers and the greens. Love my Family Time",
          "The whole park is very extensive and beautiful with many places to see. It is a pleasant environment with a nice design. When we went to the Orchid and Hibiscus gardens there were very few flowers. We enjoyed it nevertheless. There was not charge to go in and look around.",
          "This is a freebie! Great place to get out and enjoy some sunshine. Nice trails, waterfalls, creeks, plenty of plants. I guess my only disappointment with the place was that there seemed more of an emphasis on exotic (non-native) plants instead of plants that are found native",
          "This botanical garden is so peaceful with lot of greenery. There is a deer park inside the garden. Play area for kids. There is Malaysian Comic and Cartoon museum just outside the garden. It is 10 mins walk from butterfly garden and one entrance is just opposite to bird park.",
          "A truly fantastic garden which is split into different areas. It's free to enter for all and I would definitely recommend this if you like nature.",
          "Bigger than expected and lots of traffic. I advise you go for a ride around the place. Nice view tho.",
          "I took Grab to reach the entrance of the botanical garden. I guess I was early because I didn't find any employee to ask about a map that I can use. There were signs telling you where you were heading, but a map would be easier to navigate the place. You will enjoy walking and",
          "Saw the botanilca garden and luckily there was a ride for a minimum fee to get around the whole place. Orchids, hibiscus, butterflies, birds...beautiful place! But one driver was so rude... When we were asking for the price, he happened to pass by and shouted \" you have money",
          "I come to this place with my family, the problem is the visitor park their car not in parking box... They park on the side of the road. The narrow roads make traffic comes worst... Hope the security monitor this issue and put a \"full parking\" to inform the other visitor...",
          "I was staying close by the Gardens and on my Sunday morning walk, I crossed Jalan Parlimen at the one light on the road and wandered into the gardens. I only had a short time and looked forward to returning the next morning. Only when I got to the traffic light the following",

          "I don\u2019t understand why the gardens don\u2019t have a transport link which was one of my main frustrations here. We walked here which was okay but finding an entrance where we could physically enter was difficult. The gardens are vast and have a number of sections, quite a few of",

Saw big lizards roaming around and was nice to sit down anywhere and have a snack. Pleasant experience",
          "We walked and walked and couldn't easily find key exhibitions. I can see why people would be disappointed from the lack of care and clearly marked vegetation, but I still enjoyed myself. There are monkeys and there was a strong rainstorm when we were up in the orchid garden.",

        "wiki": "Kuala Lumpur (Malaysian pronunciation: [\u02c8kual\u0259, -a \u02c8lumpo(r), -\u028a(r)]), officially the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (Malay: Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Jawi: \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u06a4\u0631\u0633\u0643\u0648\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0645\u06a4\u0648\u0631; Chinese: \u5409\u9686\u5761\u806f\u90a6\u76f4\u8f44\u5340; Tamil: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb2\u0bbe \u0bb2\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd) and commonly known as KL, is the national capital and largest city in Malaysia. As the global city of Malaysia, it covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016. Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the Klang Valley, is an urban agglomeration of 7.25 million people as of 2017. It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.\nKuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Malaysian King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong), the Istana Negara. The city once held the headquarters of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government, but these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999. However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three federal territories of Malaysia, enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Towers, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysian development.\nKuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, such as mass rapid transit (MRT), light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, public buses, hop on & hop off buses (free of charge) and airport rail links. Kuala Lumpur is one of the leading cities in the world for tourism and shopping, being the 10th most-visited city in the world in 2017. The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.Kuala Lumpur has been ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking at No. 70 in the world, and No. 2 in Southeast Asia after Singapore.  Kuala Lumpur was named as one of the New7Wonders Cities, and has been named as World Book Capital 2020 by UNESCO.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nKuala Lumpur means \"muddy confluence\" in Malay; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means \"mud\". One suggestion is that it was named after Sungai Lumpur (\"muddy river\"); it was recorded in the 1820s that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River. Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak as the point where one river joins a larger one or the sea is its kuala. It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur in fact extended down to the confluence (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), although Sungai Lumpur is said to be another river joining the Klang River a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence, or perhaps located to the north of the Batu Caves area.It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (\"muddy landing place\") in the same way that Klang was once called Pengkalan Batu (\"stone landing place\"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur. Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIt is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang (Klang River) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut, raised funds from Malaccan Chinese businessmen to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines.\n\nAlthough the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from these mines was exported in 1859. At that time Sutan Puasa was already trading near Ampang, two traders from Lukut, Hiu Siew and Yap Ah Sze, then arrived in Kuala Lumpur where they set up shops to sell provisions to miners in exchange for tin. The town, spurred on by tin-mining, started to develop centred on Old Market Square (Medan Pasar), with roads radiating out towards Ampang as well as Pudu and Batu (the destinations became the names of these roads) where miners also started to settled in, and Petaling and Damansara. The miners formed gangs among themselves; and fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, particularly between factions of Kuala Lumpur and Kanching, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew the early Chinese trader was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, was appointed in 1868.Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include Haji Mohamed Tahir who became the Dato Dagang (\"chief of traders\"). The Minangkabaus from Sumatra became another important group of peoples who traded and established tobacco plantations in the area. Notable Minangkabaus include their headman Dato' Sati, Utsman Abdullah, and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru. The Minangkabaus were also significant socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.\n\n\n=== Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur ===\n\nEarly Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems \u2013 the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang. The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy. Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban centre.\n\nThe early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River \u2013 the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarters was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897.Frank Swettenham, on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated in 1884 that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the \"five-foot ways\" as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court. With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest.\n\nA railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.\n\n\n=== 20th century\u2013present ===\n\nThe area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2, and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory.The development of rubber industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based elsewhere also found a presence here.\n\nDuring World War II, Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage during the course of the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishir\u014d Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.The first municipal election in Kuala Lumpur was held on 16 February 1952. An ad hoc alliance between the Malay UMNO and Chinese MCA party candidates won a majority of the seats contested, and their success led to the formation of the Alliance Party (later the Barisan Nasional). On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. The British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang on the midnight of 30 August 1957, and in the morning of 31 August, the ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963.\n\nKuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.\nKuala Lumpur achieved city status on 1 February 1972, becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function, and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, major urban developments in the Klang Valley have resulted in an extended Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. This area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur, extends from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur westward to Port Klang, east to the edge of the Titiwangsa Mountains as well as to the north and south. The area covers other administratively separate towns and cities such as Klang, Shah Alam, Putrajaya and others, and it is served by the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. Notable projects undertaken within Kuala Lumpur itself include the development of a new Kuala Lumpur City Centre around Jalan Ampang and the Petronas Towers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley. The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to \"muddy confluence\" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers.\n\nLocated in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was a territory of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location within the most developed state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi), with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft).\n\n\n=== Climate and weather ===\nProtected by the Titiwangsa Range in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur is safe from strong winds and has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 35 \u00b0C (90 and 95 \u00b0F) and sometimes hit 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 \u00b0C (74.1 and 76.3 \u00b0F) and have never fallen below 17.8 \u00b0C (64.0 \u00b0F). Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month.\nFlood is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur after heavy downpours, especially in the city centre, because the structural irrigation lags behind the intensive development within the city. Smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nKuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who has been in office since 18 July 2015.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia. It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur's eleven districts, with estimated population and percentage of the total, serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall authority.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nKuala Lumpur is home to the Parliament of Malaysia. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, has stipulated the three branches, of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branches. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya, certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia (National Bank of Malaysia), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city.The city remains as the economic and business hub in the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city, and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang, the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.\nBursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. By 2015, the GDP has reached RM160,388 million, representing 15.1% of the total GDP of Malaysia. The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 was RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent, and RM94,722 in 2015. Average monthly household income is RM9,073 (~$2,200) as of 2016, growing at a pace of approximately 6% a year. The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the country's largest companies have their headquarters here, and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas, there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur.Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists.\nThere has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions\u2014 has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000 sq m-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.\n\nThe major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the PETRONAS Twin Towers, the Bukit Bintang shopping district, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, Petaling Street (Chinatown), the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the National Palace (Istana Negara), the National Museum, Islamic Arts Museum, Central Market, KL Bird Park, Aquaria KLCC, the National Monument, and religious sites such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Jamek Mosque, Thean Hou Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfield. Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor.The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing  Jalan P.

Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (US$2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006.\n\nSuria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier upscale shopping destination due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers.\nApart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungei Wang Plaza and Quill City Mall. Changkat area of Bukit Bintang hosts various cafes, alfresco dining outlets and illegal activities. Bangsar district also has a few shopping complexes, including Bangsar Village, Bangsar Shopping Centre, and Mid Valley Megamall.\nApart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles, fabrics and handicrafts. The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street, is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences.Since 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event at the time is held three times a year \u2013 in March, May and December \u2013 during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia which being maintained until present with new mega sales.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.76 million in the city proper as of 2016. It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites. Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley metropolitan (covering Petaling Jaya, Klang, Subang Jaya, Puchong, Shah Alam, Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.25 million as of 2017.Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians, as well as Kadazans, Ibans and other indigenous races from around Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Historical demographics ===\n\nHistorically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a \"purely Chinese village\", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war). The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2\u2013300, many of whom then brought their families here. Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka \u5ba2\u5bb6\u4eba), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another perhaps more accurate estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. The rubber boom in the early 20th century lead to a further increase in population, from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into Malaysia, many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits.Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people \u2013 the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. On the other hand, the working age group of 15\u201359 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays, the Indian Muslim communities and a small number of Chinese Muslims. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity.As of 2010 Census, the population of Kuala Lumpur was 46.4% Muslim, 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu, 5.8% Christian, 1.4% of unknown affiliations, 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 0.6% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three states where less than 50% of the population are self-identified Muslims, the other two being Penang and Sarawak.\nStatistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 87.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (7.9%), Chinese folk religions (2.7%) and Muslims (0.6%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (81.1%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Christians (7.8%), Muslims (4.9%) and Buddhists (2.1%). The non-Malay bumiputera community are predominantly Christians (44.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (31.2%) and Buddhists (13.5%). All bumiputera Malays are Muslim; this is due to the criterion in the definition of a Malay in the Malaysian constitution that they should adhere to Islam.Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. Malaysian English is a variant widely used. It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken by minorities include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi, and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles \u2013 Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.\nIndependence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Telekom Tower, Maybank Tower, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world and the tallest buildings in the country. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe Lake Gardens, a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Parliament building is located close by, and Carcosa Seri Negara which was once the official residence of British colonial administration is also sited here. The park includes a Butterfly Park, Deer Park, Orchid Garden, Hibiscus Garden and the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, which is the world's largest aviary bird park. Other parks in the city include the ASEAN Sculpture Garden, KLCC Park, Titiwangsa Lake Gardens, Metropolitan Lake Gardens in Kepong, Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, Taman Tasik Permaisuri (Queen's Lake Gardens), Bukit Kiara Botanical Gardens, Equestrian Park and West Valley Park near TTDI, and Bukit Jalil International Park.\nThere are three forest reserves within the city namely the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve in the city centre, the oldest gazetted forest reserve in the country 10.52 ha or 26.0 acres, Bukit Sungai Putih Forest Reserve (7.41 ha or 18.3 acres) and Bukit Sungai Besi Forest Reserve (42.11 ha or 104.1 acres). Bukit Nanas, in the heart of the city centre, is one of the oldest virgin forests in the world within a city. These residual forest areas are home to a number of fauna species particularly monkeys, treeshrews, pygmy goats, budgerigars, squirrels and birds.\nThere is another park in the close vicinity to Kuala Lumpur i.e. Templer Park initiated and opened by Sir Gerald Templer in 1954 during the \"Emergency\" time.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAccording to government statistics, Kuala Lumpur has a literacy rate of 97.5% in 2000, the highest rate in any state or territory in Malaysia.\nIn Malaysia, Malay is the language of instruction for most subjects while English is a compulsory subject, but as of 2012, English is still the language of instruction for mathematics and the natural sciences for certain schools. Some schools provide Mandarin and Tamil as languages of instruction for certain subjects. Each level of education demands different skills of teaching and learning ability.Kuala Lumpur contains 13 tertiary education institutions, 79 high schools, 155 elementary schools and 136 kindergartens.Several institutions in the city are older than 100 years\u2014such as Bukit Bintang Girls' School (1893\u20132000, relocated to Taman Shamelin Perkasa in Cheras and renamed GIS Garden International school Seri Bintang Utara), the Victoria Institution (1893); Methodist Girls' School (1896); Methodist Boys' School (1897); Convent Bukit Nanas (1899), St. John's Institution (1904), Confucian Private Secondary School (1906), Kuen Cheng High School (1908), Tsun Jin High School (1913) and Maxwell School (1917).\n\nKuala Lumpur is home to the University of Malaya (UM).

Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.\n\nIn terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of city. The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres, an airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eight minutes and costs RM 55 (roughly US$13.50), while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal but from KLIA2 which is two kilometres from KLIA.

As of 2018, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as Firefly and Malindo Air.Public transport in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the expansion of the rail network. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, mass rapid transit (MRT) and airport rail link. The LRT system has three lines, Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line and Sri Petaling Line, connecting many locations within the city and surrounding suburbs. The KL Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter and MRT connect the city centre with other suburbs and cities of the Klang Valley. The main railway hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the most of the rail lines. KL Sentral is also a hub for the intercity railway service KTM ETS, which travels from north to south Peninsular Malaysia through the city centre. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more railway lines due for completion or in the pipeline, such as the Putrajaya Line and Bandar Utama-Klang Line.\nThe largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus, using Rapid KL brand name. Since the take over from Intrakota Komposit Sdn Bhd, Prasarana Malaysia has redrawn the entire bus network of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley metropolitan area to increase passenger numbers and improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The Prasarana Malaysia has adopted the hub and spoke system to provide greater connectivity, and cut down the need of more buses.In Kuala Lumpur, most taxis have distinctive white and red liveries. Kuala Lumpur is one of the major ASEAN city with taxis extensively running on natural gas. Taxis can be hailed from taxi stands or from the streets.

          "Spent a couple of hours here shopping for gifts. There are lots and lots of stalls - with the vendors not being that pushy. There is also a good selection of food and drinks outside. It\u2019s worth a visit whilst in Kuala Lumpur.",
          "Here is the place to shop souvenirs and sightseeing. If you are here without appreciating unique items and gift shops then you in the wrong place. My visit was all about browsing and taking pictures of the items inside. In this area of Kuala Lumpur there are lots of hidden gems.",
          "Very junky stuff for the most part. Better stuff inside the old wet market. More local crafts and quality stuff there. Central Market is just junk. The food is good there though!",
          "This is an interesting place full of all kinds of native handicrafts and merchandise. The vendors are friendly and will haggle with you to get a better price for their goods. A good way to spend a couple of hours if you have never been. You can also put your feet in a fish tank",

          "Came here on the hunt for some gifts and was not disappointed. It is enormous inside with so many stalls and shops to buy things. They have a huge range of things - have to shop around inside to find the best price though!",
          "Full of the usual souvenir and craft shops but the stallholders are not as pushy as the open air stalls . The highlight is the food court upstairs where a you can have a quality freshly prepared meal for pennies .",
          "Fantastic. So much to choose from and great prices. Get there by free bus or on the momorail and shop all day. Great food as well.",
          "Amazing place for nick knacks you just might find something that you would be looking for or not. We wondered around for a few hours and found an assortment of trinkets for friends. If you need time to kill this is ideal.",
          "This more than 100 years old building featured an Art Deco architecture which is a rare sighting in this country. This building has aged well over the years. Even as a local, I always find it captivating every time I walk around and inside this building. The upcoming pedestrian",
          "We visit there just kill the time but when we finished our tour, we buy a lot of varieties in cloth from there, so must go this market if you want to buy cheap and good quality of cloths. Market peoples are also very much friendly.",
          "This historic market serves the locals of KL and so as a tourist you don't get hounded at every stall - it is a relaxed affair you can pick and choose as your leisure. It is air conditioned and a somewhat relief from the heat ! The prices are all what you would expect from a",
          "The old light blue building of the Central market is my favourite place to stroll around undisturbed looking at merchandise. The individual shops are selling clothes, jewellery, home decoration items, bags and souvenirs from all over Asia. If you don't particularly like shopping",
          "Here is one place where you can bring your out-of-town visitors to view (and buy) locally-made products.",
          "If the visitors stay nearby Petaling Street, you can go to the market by foot.Located at city centre ,KL and is one of the crowded people hot landmarks. The one special job, ie you may have an real human pictures drawn by painter at reasonable prices here.",
          "Central Market is close to Chinatown and Pasar Seni. Worth a visit. Decent food court, souvenir shops.",

          "Enjoyed a visit to the indoor market, which had a large number of stalls across two floors. A very wide range of goods on sale. ice atmosphere.",
          "A lot of souvenirs of low quality. Our daughter loves the Dr. Fish. Take your own tissue paper if plan to use the toilet as you get only 1 tiny piece.",
          "Sell souvenir but not thing special, quite expensive, except fresh ice cream i don't remember the name ^^",
          "You can find anything and everything in this market. They are inexpensive items to buy your souvenirs for friends or family. Although, I did not try any bargaining but i believe you can do so with certain items but when they have priced sticker on them, I just paid what they",

          "If you\u2019re looking to escape the malls in the city with cool shops and places to eat come here. The Central Market was a welcomed relief from the many malls around the city that are basically all the same.",
          "Nothing special to highlight about the place, it was one of those touristy places with higher prices on offer.",
          "Tourist stop worth a visit to to see Malaysian textiles and food/snacks. The day I was there a bus load or two of tourists came and the market became so crowded to walk/shop so best to come early.",
          "Not so authentic i'd say, but you can find beautiful things. The food is not so good though so i suggest eating somewhere else.",
          "This is a good place to visit with standard prices but you can still bargain! Lots of nice clothes etc. All prices same and often cheaper than uk",
          "Love the ambience, there\u2019s this store named Indus Heritage which is on the first left from the entrance and the second store on the right (Lorong India) where the lady ms Rizwana draws lovely henna. Very nice woman who draws lovely henna, the shop sells loads of handmade items",
          "On my A-list of places to visit in KL. When visiting abroad I enjoy picking up souvenirs fo myself and gifts for friends. Don\u2019t think there is a better place to do this. So if you too want to bring things home, for yourself and others, be sure to put Central Market high on",
          "Litterally cool place during hot day in KL. the place is nice. most of the shops selling clothing, crafts and souvenirs. Good to see around.",
          "The to-go place for local handicrafts and souvenirs. If you want generic fake branded stuff, Chinatown is a few blocks away, this place is more for artisan knick-knacks, art, and more local souvenir stuff. Worth checking out",
          "Large indoor market that is full of vendors selling anything and everything but mainly cheap tourist souvenirs The best thing about this place is that it\u2019s air conditioned, so we used it to cool down before visiting other nearby places worthy of our time!",
          "Basically it\u2019s a large market with a variety of tatt sold to tourists. What more needs to be said? If you want a variety of fridge magnets, objet d\u2019arts of the Petronas Towers, keyrings, pens etc etc.....then this is the place to come to. You\u2019ll be in souvenir heaven.",
          "I just came to show this place to my kids..I used to come here during my school days after my tuition class..There are alot of souvenirs shops here..Those who wanna buy souvenirs for their loved ones or friends this is the best place..Those who wanna have portrait paintings also",
          "I may have picked wrong, but I had the worst noodle dish in KL at the food court. The food was so greasy that I couldn't eat it and was ill from the few bites that I took.",
          "Vast selection of souvenirs at remarkable prices, a one stop shop and fully air conditioned. There is also a good Old Town White Coffee cafe on the ground floor.",
          "I visited this shopping centre a few years ago on my last visit to KL. I purchased a few lovely hand woven images throws, along with hand batik silk trousers, which I still use and love. However, I was disappointed on this visit to find no quality shops, simply numerous stalls",
          "I love this place, all the local handicrafts in one place at reasonable prices, no need to haggle. Everything from the local batik cloth to jade bangles, and coconut goods. On top of that a food court with delicious local food, but if you are feeling homesick there is a coffee",
          "As an Australian, the price of clothing of all kinds as well as the delicious choice of food in the Food Court upstairs was great value for money.",
          "Good to find local products here, more local atmosphere. You can bargain price at certain shop, have aircond inside. So wont feel hot while you shop around. Outside the market, you can find local fruits there (such as durian, mangosteen, mango, rambutan and many more here.",
          "This Art Deco building houses an array of creative artistic shops, lots of traditional clothing outlets providing Malaysian, Indian and Chinese outfits, souvenirs etc. There are one or two decent eateries. Well worth visiting perhaps before going onto the chaos of Petaling",
          "you can find almost everything here. I always come here to buy postcards. with the reasonable prices",
          "Great place to shop. There is a food area, and tons of food outside. There is air-conditioning inside so it is a nice place to duck into. You can get some great deals on clothes here. The Tom's shoes shop is a great deal.",
          "Personally, I was not that superbly impressed by the place. It was just average and so-so. If you like crafts, and particularly Malaysian handicrafts, then this would be the place for you. Tons of touristy souvenirs too, though you can try Petaling Street where you can haggle",
          "I have visited this a few times over the years. Whilst it has a myriad of shops I have never bought anything. Mind you I think it's because I have got to the stage in life I don't need anything. Check it out - right on the edge of Chinatown so can combine the two.",
          "You must visit the market while here. It is worth seeing to experience the flavors of the city. It has changed over the past 20 years but always a pleasurable experience.",
          "This place is a real treasure trove of stalls with so many different things from different cultures at very reasonable prices. a great stop off near to China Town with a bigger range of products than Petaling Street Market.",
          "Not much to do here other than shop for some cheap touristy souvenirs. There are much nicer markets than this.",
          "Enjoyed a nice wonder around this market and the information desk were very helpful it\u2019s close to china town",
          "Thisbis just opposite Petaling street, Chinatown. A stunning market with lots of curios and clothes and lovely sweets and snacks.",
          "Not far from China town and walking distance from KL express. Ideal for picking up last minute souvenirs. Quite safe.",
          "Had an awful experience. My family was threatened and humiliated by a Bangladeshi street trader selling handbags. They surrounded us and challenged us to a fight. This all happened within a three minute conversation. I was disgusted. I had to back down, I couldn't afford",
          "An incredible local market with vendors who sell everything local. From handbags, scarfs, food, magnets etc etc. The people are very friendly and will barter with you on the price. NEVER, EVER pay the full price mentioned. You can go 25-30% lower on all things. Around Central",
          "visited this place with wife and 3 teenagers. it has been renovated since we visited many years ago and is now air conditioned. numerous varieties of similar souvenirs so it's worth doing a comparison among the shops before buying. most are fixed priced. there are food stalls",
          "If you're looking for local souvenirs from Kuala Lumpur, this is the place to visit as there is a wide range of souvenirs here.",
          "Lots of choices, found prices a bit high. Wish we had skipped this since we had limited time. There were other places we missed because we wasted time coming here. Traffic getting anywhere is horrendous.",
          "It\u2019s a good place to be if it\u2019s raining out or if you need a break from the heat. It has Ir conditioning, shops with handmade crafts and Of course food and drinks as well as washrooms. There\u2019s also a DHL desk on the main floor if you want to ship Things you\u2019ve bought.",
          "Good place to purchase soviener and other local items at reasonable cost. A must visit place for tourist",
          "I was very happy that this whole \"mall\" had AC so we were able to wander around all the shops without melting. They sell all kinds of things and have an ATM and food court. We tried a thai place and it was fine but nothing special. There are plenty of little gifts and things if",
          "This must be the best market experience ever! Shopping for bargains in cool comfort and no feelings of being hot and can\u2019t be bothered. I loved it.I think the city administrators had a great idea when they decided to put the stalls under a roof and add aircon But if this",
          "Visited here in conjunction with China Town a few blocks away - lots on sale but repetitive stalls next to each other - surprisingly it was almost deserted and the stall holders were sitting playing with their phones and almost outnumbered the potential customers - prices that I",
          "This place really nice and good for toursist to buy souvenirs such as bags, magnets, keychains, coin purses, wallets, clothes, house decors, foods and more. The price is in the middle of cheap to expensive. The only tip that I can give is to buy a bulk items or buy a whole sale",
          "Plenty of stuff to sift through here but like anything, once you\u2019ve seen a few vendors you\u2019ve seen most. Prices are very expensive for Malaysia also so make sure you barter everything down. For example T-Shirts bought at a local community market cost us 5RM each and at central",
          "We came here by LRT public transport that was easy. The market is nice, clean, the shop owners are not noisy and they are friendly. We were amazed by the various colors of goods at the corridors.",
          "Would not say this is a must do, but if you're in the area it is a nice break from the heat. There are many shops offering mostly inexpensive souvenirs.",
          "Good location for artisanal products and souvenirs There some good deals at market Fresh juices, bamboo putu",
          "Very large market with big choice end low price very interesting. The venders are, not usual offen elsevery, very kind and not agressive. Food offered in various kinds and good quality and price. We like Kuala Lumpur and already returned 2 times coming from Tailand.",
          "Indoor market with parking outside. The market has two floors and is air-conditioned. Lots of local souvenirs to buy and a few restaurants. There\u2019s also a pub right at the end in the next building if you fancy a beer. There is a money-changer and ATM machines. You can find local",
          "Walk around for shopping.. Cheapest and best of Malaysia.. Find most of local foods.. Fresh juices and dessert..",
          "one of the heaven on earth for souvenirs hunters. you will get best quality of the items.and price bit higher from Petaling street.",
          "We went in the evening and unless your after cheap tourist rubbish I probably would not waste my time .",
          "This market just small point to visit for selling local art and product for souvenir, Have both indoor and outdoor market, I think indoor is quite quiet and not much people. Actually you don't need to visit here but if you have a lot of time and no idea where to go it's OK to",
          "Central Market is basically a fixed price, \u2018better quality product\u2019 version of the neighbouring Petaling Street [see my other reviews]. Even though haggling was rarer and the products were of higher quality, the pricing was still fantastic. They had a dynamic range of shops and",
          "There is plenty of souveniers and other shops mainly for tourists. So it is not a classical market but still a good place to visit.",
          "Very good place indeed to but different kind of Malaysian things. Must visit for all, if you really want to buy some True Malaysian stuff. I went to almost all the malls, but none of them had so much Malaysian and Chinese products that I got to see over here. Also, they have",
          "This is an excellent place for souvenirs and nearly everything a shopper wants ! .. there are 2 floors and the quality of stuff there is also good.. Have enough time on hand to shop and stroll here .. also centally ac ....good visit",
          "We left this for the last day and we were completely out of money by then. DONOT DO WHAT WE DID! If you love sourvenis, decor and art pieces, visit this on your first few days. The handicraft was beautiful.",
          "Unfortunately we were not able to buy the handicraft items in this mall. We have to stay at 20 kg, max weight, in our suitcase. We\u2019ve been traveling continuously for the last 8 months. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve purchased some of the straw purses and batik!",
          "Interesting stop to visit while in KL. Had Pad Thai at one of the food outlets. Good prices on local peices. Again a great stop while in town.",
          "It\u2019s nice to wonder around and see all the shops and stalls. Good to pick up some souvenirs as well as shop. A variety of different food options available for lunch or dinner. Also it\u2019s walking distance to Chinatown so you can kill two birds with one stone",
          "This is a great market. There's everything here. Lots to see and buy. There's a huge store upstairs crammed with items, which is really tempting. All markets should be like this.",
          "Many shops and stalls filled with the same \"stuff\" you find in almost every city or flea market. There were 2 or 3 better shops, but very limited. Not really worth the stop.",
          "Tourists in search for souvenirs and local products would surely want to visit this place. Be ready to haggle though, as prices are not fixed and it is an adventure to guess how much the vendor is willing to part with his goods. Bags, T-shirts, scarves,local knickknacks,",
          "The market is air conditioned which is a selling point. The selection wasn't large and the choices weren't varied. We really wanted to buy souvenirs and bought nothing.",
          "Our hotel (Travelodge City Centre) was just across the road from the Central Markets so it was easy to access. Good selection of KL souvenirs throughout - at reasonable prices. You can try & bargain - but many are fixed prices (but still good value). Plenty of eating options",
          "Good place to make a shopping. You will find there local souvenirs- batik clothes, some jewellery and of course some Chinese world brands. On the first floor is a food court with many different restaurants - cheap and tasty.",
          "We visted the Central MArkets and found the place interesting... lots of various items from malysian / indian style clothing to other nick nacks.. Left there for the markets directly outside, not veary inspiring.....",
          "At 5 minutes walk from Famous Chinatown this is a rennovated version of more than a century old market and a historical landmark. Authentic as well as duplicate items are available and you have to bargain hard. Many shops are being run by migrants from Bangladesh.",
          "This is the oldest market in Malaysia with stalls selling clothes, jewellery, food, anything and everything. There is a Little India where one can find Indian spices, handicrafts, fabrics etc. A must place to visit.",
          "This market was ok. Geared for tourists. You have to pay to go to the toilet. Really great food court though. Everything else to buy inside is a tourist trap. Over priced. Air-conditioning is nice.",
          "While KL houses large Malls the like is Pavilion but this is an apt place to go to for local shopping. Very accessible via all local transport. It is spread over 4 floors housing the local stuffs. They have a decent food mall but difficult to find vegetarian food",
          "A mixture of high end and middle end goods - however there are gems \ud83d\udc8e here as some items are unique to Malaysia \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfe Good prices especially at the shoes outlet store Authentic Malaysian food can be found in the second level",
          "As one of the iconic tourist destination. It is a great place for us as tourist to visit and know. Looking gift for our friends and family member in our home. It is a good place for it. Market is close air, aircond and clean. Outside the building also available for open air",
          "Nice little market with aircon. You can find lots of souvenirs and decent food. Worthy stop if you are visiting that part of the city.",
          "Market area building spreads over 4 floors is full of interesting clothing, souvenirs,batic and a food court floor. There are many good quality and budget items to choose from and all indoors away from the blazing sun.",
          "Central market is a must visit destination for all tourists, as well as many locals. The building is ideal for buying Malaysia souvenirs as there are many boutiques, handicraft and souvenir stalls as well as authentic Malaysian batik prints shops. Many food and drink options",
          "A lot of Batik and evwn more. You can also find a Chinese restaurant and some \"original fakes\". It is your choice and risk. But nothing different from \"similar\" places in Asia.",
          "its a great place for authenthic Malaysian souvenirs and a place to spend your last ringets. you can get a few bargains but only if your bargain",
          "This place is for tourists, if you need to buy prepackaged foods to take home or souvenirs, some are quirky compared to the ones on the street Prices are affordable, but the plus side is, you are shopping in air conditioning & if you're hungry, go upstair to their food court,",
          "For those who don't know where to get souvenir or local delicacies to bring home. Can drop by central market. Along the fivefoot way outside the complex there are stalls set up selling all kinds of stuff as well but the price can be quite high as mostly tourist visit this place.",
          "A typical example of an asian market. I found most shops have fixed prices. A variety of items and food is available.",
          "You can find lots of local food, local stuff here. There are stalls and proper shop for you to try the delicacies.",
          "Great clean place well taking care off. Trader are very friendly and don\u2019t push you to buy & very talkative enjoying different nationalities. Typical tourist place with nice little trinkets to buy. the food court at allows you to enjoy a little bit of the local cuisine without",
          "Best market in kl. Shops are well stocked, well priced and staff leave you alone to look. I'd highly recommend",
          "A must visit when coming to KL. Great for shopping handicrafts, clothes, jewellery, trinkets, homewares. I love people watching here, so much going on.",
          "Lots of interesting little shops all under one roof. Some normal touristy rubbish, but also some unique gift ideas. There is a DHL package service available at the front of the market so that you can post items back home if you haven\u2019t got room in your luggage.",
          "many good food places...thai food. peranakan...food court...n secret recipes...local clothes...chocolate...n clean environment",
          "The central market has lots of arts and crafts on display and for sale. This place is also well stocked with batik items made in Malaysia. A good place to shop for souvenirs or for home decor purposes.",
          "I am a tourist traveling without internet and I lost my family while shopping however the shopping mall policy prevented me from getting in contact with my family because even thou they have a intercom system in place it is not for the public has left me very upset and",
          "Central Market are the best for you to get a souvenirs for your family and friends. Do not forget to bargain, and they are nice people who\u2019s selling the products. You will get best deal if you are talk to them like a friend, in Malaysia we addressed indian stall or street",
          "Had a great time at the market. The shop owners were not as aggressive as the ones on Petaling Street. My daughter bought a beautiful leather clutch bag and the workers gave us bottles of water while we browsed. At another shop, we bought a crystal. They have plenty of",
          "As a local, I wouldn\u2019t recommend any of my tourist friends to shop here. It\u2019s overrated and expensive. Just come for the sake of pics (if you have to) or air conditioning if you\u2019re feeling hot from all the walking you did. Honestly, you won\u2019t see locals frequenting this place.",
          "hi all, its a nice place for traditional shopping experience. it is situated at the heart of KL with all famous streets around.",
          "The market is really cute and lovely, i lile going there. They offer many things for tourists and also local gems. There is a food street beside it where one can have snacks. The place is just nice to have a stroll through.",
          "Plenty of local handicrafts that would make good souvenirs,otherwise just worth a gander if your going to the petaling st area",
          "Enjoyed my time here and found affordable quality gifts for my friends and family. Worth the stop when you are in town.",
          "The cheapest spot to by is the shop located on the center of the market. Considering other shop and do bargain before buy something",
          "We loved Central Market for shopping for souvenirs. It was clean and the vendors didn't harass you. Pleasant shopping experience!",
          "Easier reach the place via LRT- Pasir Seni. They sell local products like batiks, semi gemstones, paintings, fridge magnets etc. Prices varied and you can bargain to get better deals. I got several stuff there and I wish I have more time there. Will visit again.",
          "Cheap looking building, but prices does not look the same, many stuff overpriced. But you can discuss :)",
          "Nice clothes and souvenirs could be found in the market. Local snacks sold outside of the main building of the market.",

          "An old building but kept very well. Lots of malaysian clothes - batik, kebaya, souvenir tshirts and items. They have a food court. They also have artist area. Prices are reasonable.",
          "Can get assorted local foodstuff and souvenirs from here but its quite pricey as its targeted at tourist. Can bargain for good deals",
          "With lots of expectation we went there but there was nothing much rather than same type of shops selling mainly ready made garments and too expensive. There are roadside shops are around selling same product much cheaper than at Central Market.",
          "We expected a lot more than something that was just another \u201cmarket\u201d with many stalls that offer the same thing and not necessarily at the best price. If you in the area and have nothing to do then take a stroll but would not recommend to go there specifically.",
          "Visited after going to Petaling street and I was quite glad to see that the stalls here don\u2019t merely sell the same stuff as in the Chinese Market Street. It is also touristy, yeah, but with more style and they have very tasteful stalls. They sell coffee/tea; clothes; furniture;",
          "Lots of bargains to find here, lots of different stalls. We found some unique stalls and shops here.",
          "Central Market is a Malaysian Art & Culture Centre where visitors I will have a chance to buy crafts, paintings and souvenirs all under one roof. A nice place for locals or tourists to spend an afternoon while in Kuala Lumpur. Accessible by LRT and MRT. Disembark at Pasar Seni.",

          "We spent about an hour at the market during an organised excursion. It's a popular place with tour companies as they seem to co-ordinate so one arrives as the other leaves. There is an indoor and outdoor section. We spent most of our time indoors. I got the screen protector",
          "The atmosphere and friendliness from the market sellers was great. It is safe, clean and you will find unique items to take home and see. Try to stay away from petaling street as the vendors there become quite aggressive when you decide not to buy something.",

          "With so many shops it takes a while to see all of them. While some souvenir shops will carry the same items, the specific shops (Indian, Chinese) will have traditional clothing and objects. Take your time when looking and you will definitely find something great.",
          "Various stalls and the good thing is you don't get hassled by sellers. Upstairs is a food court with a gem of a restaurant called Green Bowl - absolutely fantastic for lunch. Fish that eat skin off your feet are also a good laugh for \u00a32!",

          "It is an interesting little market. We were there for 1 hour and there were at least 5-6 tour groups guiding 20-40 tourists through the small market which makes it pretty annoying and tight. Also, everything can be had at the street market for substantially less, even the little",

          "After being told how great this market was for buying authentic souvenirs we were a little disappointed on what was on offer or available. We did eventually managed to find acceptable items to purchase but were not overwhelmed by the experience.",
          "Opens between 10am and 9pm, lots (maybe 100+) of independent stalls and stores inside selling most things.....toys, clothes, herbs, batik, photographic equipment etc. Well worth visiting.",

As the global city of Malaysia, it covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016. Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the Klang Valley, is an urban agglomeration of 7.25 million people as of 2017. It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.\nKuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Malaysian King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong), the Istana Negara. The city once held the headquarters of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government, but these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999. However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three federal territories of Malaysia, enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Towers, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysian development.\nKuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, such as mass rapid transit (MRT), light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, public buses, hop on & hop off buses (free of charge) and airport rail links. Kuala Lumpur is one of the leading cities in the world for tourism and shopping, being the 10th most-visited city in the world in 2017. The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.Kuala Lumpur has been ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking at No. 70 in the world, and No. 2 in Southeast Asia after Singapore.  Kuala Lumpur was named as one of the New7Wonders Cities, and has been named as World Book Capital 2020 by UNESCO.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nKuala Lumpur means \"muddy confluence\" in Malay; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means \"mud\". One suggestion is that it was named after Sungai Lumpur (\"muddy river\"); it was recorded in the 1820s that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River. Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak as the point where one river joins a larger one or the sea is its kuala. It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur in fact extended down to the confluence (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), although Sungai Lumpur is said to be another river joining the Klang River a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence, or perhaps located to the north of the Batu Caves area.It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (\"muddy landing place\") in the same way that Klang was once called Pengkalan Batu (\"stone landing place\"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur. Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIt is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang (Klang River) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut, raised funds from Malaccan Chinese businessmen to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines.\n\nAlthough the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from these mines was exported in 1859. At that time Sutan Puasa was already trading near Ampang, two traders from Lukut, Hiu Siew and Yap Ah Sze, then arrived in Kuala Lumpur where they set up shops to sell provisions to miners in exchange for tin. The town, spurred on by tin-mining, started to develop centred on Old Market Square (Medan Pasar), with roads radiating out towards Ampang as well as Pudu and Batu (the destinations became the names of these roads) where miners also started to settled in, and Petaling and Damansara. The miners formed gangs among themselves; and fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, particularly between factions of Kuala Lumpur and Kanching, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew the early Chinese trader was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, was appointed in 1868.Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include Haji Mohamed Tahir who became the Dato Dagang (\"chief of traders\"). The Minangkabaus from Sumatra became another important group of peoples who traded and established tobacco plantations in the area. Notable Minangkabaus include their headman Dato' Sati, Utsman Abdullah, and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru. The Minangkabaus were also significant socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.\n\n\n=== Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur ===\n\nEarly Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems \u2013 the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang. The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy. Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban centre.\n\nThe early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River \u2013 the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarters was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897.Frank Swettenham, on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated in 1884 that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the \"five-foot ways\" as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court. With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest.\n\nA railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.\n\n\n=== 20th century\u2013present ===\n\nThe area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2, and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory.The development of rubber industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based elsewhere also found a presence here.\n\nDuring World War II, Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage during the course of the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishir\u014d Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.The first municipal election in Kuala Lumpur was held on 16 February 1952. An ad hoc alliance between the Malay UMNO and Chinese MCA party candidates won a majority of the seats contested, and their success led to the formation of the Alliance Party (later the Barisan Nasional). On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. The British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang on the midnight of 30 August 1957, and in the morning of 31 August, the ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963.\n\nKuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.\nKuala Lumpur achieved city status on 1 February 1972, becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function, and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, major urban developments in the Klang Valley have resulted in an extended Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. This area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur, extends from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur westward to Port Klang, east to the edge of the Titiwangsa Mountains as well as to the north and south. The area covers other administratively separate towns and cities such as Klang, Shah Alam, Putrajaya and others, and it is served by the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. Notable projects undertaken within Kuala Lumpur itself include the development of a new Kuala Lumpur City Centre around Jalan Ampang and the Petronas Towers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley. The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to \"muddy confluence\" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers.\n\nLocated in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was a territory of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location within the most developed state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi), with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft).\n\n\n=== Climate and weather ===\nProtected by the Titiwangsa Range in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur is safe from strong winds and has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 35 \u00b0C (90 and 95 \u00b0F) and sometimes hit 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 \u00b0C (74.1 and 76.3 \u00b0F) and have never fallen below 17.8 \u00b0C (64.0 \u00b0F). Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month.\nFlood is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur after heavy downpours, especially in the city centre, because the structural irrigation lags behind the intensive development within the city. Smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nKuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who has been in office since 18 July 2015.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia. It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur's eleven districts, with estimated population and percentage of the total, serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall authority.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nKuala Lumpur is home to the Parliament of Malaysia. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, has stipulated the three branches, of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branches. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya, certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia (National Bank of Malaysia), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city.The city remains as the economic and business hub in the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city, and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang, the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.\nBursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. By 2015, the GDP has reached RM160,388 million, representing 15.1% of the total GDP of Malaysia. The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 was RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent, and RM94,722 in 2015. Average monthly household income is RM9,073 (~$2,200) as of 2016, growing at a pace of approximately 6% a year. The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the country's largest companies have their headquarters here, and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas, there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur.Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists.\nThere has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions\u2014 has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000 sq m-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.\n\nThe major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the PETRONAS Twin Towers, the Bukit Bintang shopping district, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, Petaling Street (Chinatown), the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the National Palace (Istana Negara), the National Museum, Islamic Arts Museum, Central Market, KL Bird Park, Aquaria KLCC, the National Monument, and religious sites such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Jamek Mosque, Thean Hou Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfield. Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor.The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing  Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. Trendy nightclubs, bars and lounges, such as Marini's on 57, Skybar at Traders Hotel, the Beach Club, Espanda, the Hakka Republic Wine Bar & Restaurant, Hard Rock Cafe, the Luna Bar, Nuovo, Rum Jungle, No Black Tie, the Thai Club, Zion club, Zouk, and many others are located here.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nKuala Lumpur alone has 66 shopping malls and is the retail and fashion hub in Malaysia as well as Southeast Asia. Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (US$2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006.\n\nSuria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier upscale shopping destination due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers.\nApart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungei Wang Plaza and Quill City Mall. Changkat area of Bukit Bintang hosts various cafes, alfresco dining outlets and illegal activities. Bangsar district also has a few shopping complexes, including Bangsar Village, Bangsar Shopping Centre, and Mid Valley Megamall.\nApart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles, fabrics and handicrafts. The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street, is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences.Since 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event at the time is held three times a year \u2013 in March, May and December \u2013 during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia which being maintained until present with new mega sales.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.76 million in the city proper as of 2016. It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites. Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley metropolitan (covering Petaling Jaya, Klang, Subang Jaya, Puchong, Shah Alam, Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.25 million as of 2017.Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians, as well as Kadazans, Ibans and other indigenous races from around Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Historical demographics ===\n\nHistorically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a \"purely Chinese village\", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war). The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2\u2013300, many of whom then brought their families here. Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka \u5ba2\u5bb6\u4eba), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another perhaps more accurate estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. The rubber boom in the early 20th century lead to a further increase in population, from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into Malaysia, many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits.Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people \u2013 the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. On the other hand, the working age group of 15\u201359 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays, the Indian Muslim communities and a small number of Chinese Muslims. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity.As of 2010 Census, the population of Kuala Lumpur was 46.4% Muslim, 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu, 5.8% Christian, 1.4% of unknown affiliations, 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 0.6% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three states where less than 50% of the population are self-identified Muslims, the other two being Penang and Sarawak.\nStatistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 87.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (7.9%), Chinese folk religions (2.7%) and Muslims (0.6%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (81.1%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Christians (7.8%), Muslims (4.9%) and Buddhists (2.1%). The non-Malay bumiputera community are predominantly Christians (44.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (31.2%) and Buddhists (13.5%). All bumiputera Malays are Muslim; this is due to the criterion in the definition of a Malay in the Malaysian constitution that they should adhere to Islam.Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. Malaysian English is a variant widely used. It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken by minorities include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi, and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles \u2013 Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.\nIndependence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Telekom Tower, Maybank Tower, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world and the tallest buildings in the country. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe Lake Gardens, a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Parliament building is located close by, and Carcosa Seri Negara which was once the official residence of British colonial administration is also sited here. The park includes a Butterfly Park, Deer Park, Orchid Garden, Hibiscus Garden and the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, which is the world's largest aviary bird park. Other parks in the city include the ASEAN Sculpture Garden, KLCC Park, Titiwangsa Lake Gardens, Metropolitan Lake Gardens in Kepong, Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, Taman Tasik Permaisuri (Queen's Lake Gardens), Bukit Kiara Botanical Gardens, Equestrian Park and West Valley Park near TTDI, and Bukit Jalil International Park.\nThere are three forest reserves within the city namely the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve in the city centre, the oldest gazetted forest reserve in the country 10.52 ha or 26.0 acres, Bukit Sungai Putih Forest Reserve (7.41 ha or 18.3 acres) and Bukit Sungai Besi Forest Reserve (42.11 ha or 104.1 acres). Bukit Nanas, in the heart of the city centre, is one of the oldest virgin forests in the world within a city. These residual forest areas are home to a number of fauna species particularly monkeys, treeshrews, pygmy goats, budgerigars, squirrels and birds.\nThere is another park in the close vicinity to Kuala Lumpur i.e. Templer Park initiated and opened by Sir Gerald Templer in 1954 during the \"Emergency\" time.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAccording to government statistics, Kuala Lumpur has a literacy rate of 97.5% in 2000, the highest rate in any state or territory in Malaysia.\nIn Malaysia, Malay is the language of instruction for most subjects while English is a compulsory subject, but as of 2012, English is still the language of instruction for mathematics and the natural sciences for certain schools. Some schools provide Mandarin and Tamil as languages of instruction for certain subjects. Each level of education demands different skills of teaching and learning ability.Kuala Lumpur contains 13 tertiary education institutions, 79 high schools, 155 elementary schools and 136 kindergartens.Several institutions in the city are older than 100 years\u2014such as Bukit Bintang Girls' School (1893\u20132000, relocated to Taman Shamelin Perkasa in Cheras and renamed GIS Garden International school Seri Bintang Utara), the Victoria Institution (1893); Methodist Girls' School (1896); Methodist Boys' School (1897); Convent Bukit Nanas (1899), St. John's Institution (1904), Confucian Private Secondary School (1906), Kuen Cheng High School (1908), Tsun Jin High School (1913) and Maxwell School (1917).\n\nKuala Lumpur is home to the University of Malaya (UM). Established in 1949, it is the oldest university in Malaysia, and one of the oldest in the region. It was ranked the best university in Malaysia, the 22nd best in Asia, and 3rd in Southeast Asia in QS World University Rankings 2019. In recent years, the number of international students at University of Malaya has risen, as a result of increasing efforts made to attract more international students.Other universities located in Kuala Lumpur include Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TARUC), UCSI University (UCSI), Taylor's University (TULC), International Medical University (IMU), Open University Malaysia (OUM), Kuala Lumpur University (UniKL), Wawasan Open University (WOU), HELP University and the branch campus of the National University of Malaysia (UKM) and University of Technology Malaysia (UTM). The National Defence University of Malaysia is located at Sungai Besi Army Base, at the southern part of central Kuala Lumpur. It was established to be a major centre for military and defence technology studies. This institution covers studies in the field of army, navy, and air force.Greater Kuala Lumpur covers an even more extensive selection of universities including several international branches such as Monash University Malaysia Campus, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus and Xiamen University Malaysia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is a hub for cultural activities and events in Malaysia. Among the centres is the National Museum, which is situated along the Mahameru Highway. Its collection comprises artefacts and paintings collected throughout the country. The Islamic Arts Museum, which houses more than seven thousand Islamic artefacts including rare exhibits as well as a library of Islamic art books, is the largest Islamic Arts collection in Southeast Asia. The museum's collection not only concentrate on works from the Middle East, but also includes work from elsewhere in Asia, such as China and Southeast Asia. Kuala Lumpur has a Craft Complex coupled with a museum that displays a variety of textile, ceramic, metal craft and weaved products. All the information of the production process are portrayed in diorama format complete with historical facts, technique and traditionally engineered equipment. Among the processes shown are pottery making, intricate wood carving, silver-smithing, weaving songket cloth, stamping batik patterns on cloth and boat making. Royal Selangor has an ultra modern visitor's centre, which allows tours to be conducted through its pewter museum, gallery and its factory. In its pewtersmithing workshop, \"The School of Hard Knocks\", participants are taught to create their own pewter dish using traditional tools and methods.\nThe premier performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall located underneath the Petronas Towers. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO), consisting of musicians from all over the world and features regular concerts, chamber concerts and traditional cultural performances.

Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.\n\nIn terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of city. The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres, an airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eight minutes and costs RM 55 (roughly US$13.50), while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal but from KLIA2 which is two kilometres from KLIA. KLIA2 is served by an extension of the KLIA Ekspres and by a free shuttle bus service from KLIA. As of 2018, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as Firefly and Malindo Air.Public transport in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the expansion of the rail network. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, mass rapid transit (MRT) and airport rail link. The LRT system has three lines, Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line and Sri Petaling Line, connecting many locations within the city and surrounding suburbs. The KL Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter and MRT connect the city centre with other suburbs and cities of the Klang Valley. The main railway hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the most of the rail lines. KL Sentral is also a hub for the intercity railway service KTM ETS, which travels from north to south Peninsular Malaysia through the city centre. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more railway lines due for completion or in the pipeline, such as the Putrajaya Line and Bandar Utama-Klang Line.\nThe largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus, using Rapid KL brand name. Since the take over from Intrakota Komposit Sdn Bhd, Prasarana Malaysia has redrawn the entire bus network of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley metropolitan area to increase passenger numbers and improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The Prasarana Malaysia has adopted the hub and spoke system to provide greater connectivity, and cut down the need of more buses.In Kuala Lumpur, most taxis have distinctive white and red liveries. Kuala Lumpur is one of the major ASEAN city with taxis extensively running on natural gas. Taxis can be hailed from taxi stands or from the streets. Nevertheless, it was claimed by London-based website, LondonCabs.co.uk, taxis services in the city are charging high rates to passengers by refusing to turn on their meter and offer instead a flat rate fare that is overpriced, although other passengers refuted such claims.Kuala Lumpur is served by Port Klang, located about 64 km (40 mi) southwest of the city. The port is the largest and busiest in the country handling about 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargo in 2006.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nKuala Lumpur is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Kuala Lumpur\nPutrajaya\nCyberjaya\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGullick, J.M.

          "The National Museum of Malaysia is located closer to the KL Central. You can directly get off from the KL Express train on your arrival day and visit the museum because it's just a few minutes walk from the station. There are four sections of the museum. You can start from the",

          "Was a beautiful and well organized museum and we learned a lot about the vast and varied history of Malaysia. Truly enjoyable and worth seeing. We didn\u2019t realize until leaving that there are a few different museums on site. The signage was unclear and after the fact I understood",
          "4 separate exhibitions take you through geological formation, early history of man, Malay history, right up to the Commonwealth days and then bang up to date. Its only MYR5 per person and a good 1-2 hour diversion especially on a wet day! Best wat there is the Muzeum MRT green",
          "Undoubtedly, Malaysia is a very diverse country. The dizzying variety of food here just illustrates that. At one or another, visitors here have to ask themselves how this country became so diverse and how does one place so diverse manage to maintain it's cohesiveness and",

          "The museum covers the history of the area, from prehistoric times to the present. The exhibits are well-marked in English and in Malay. However, if you can, get the 10 am free guided tour in English--you will learn much more than just reading the signage that way. I ended up",

          "This museum in my opinion does a HUGE disservice to the rich cultural history of Malaysia and her inhabitants. It's ashamed but also quite obvious that the government of Malaysia has decided to either abandon or holds no reverence and importance in making much attempt or effort",
          "For a small price you get to learn about the entirety of Malaysia's history, from prehistoric to now. There is a logic to the exhibition and it is all well presented, but not exceptionally so. They have basic bathroom facilities. The building itself is also quite special, and",

          "I joined the English free walking tour of the museum, held daily at 10AM, which runs even with just one person joining. And I'm so glad I did! The volunteer guide, Eric, gave us an enjoyable 3h crash course in Malaysia's history, and since I didn't know much about the country",
          "we stumbled across the museum, it's very good, very informative. we didn't know half the stuff before we came here. loads of artifacts and things to see and read. entry is 5ringit, very cheap. took us a couple of hours. go downstairs to exit and they have little market stalls.",
          "(27 May 2019) We were lucky to join the 10am English guided tour , where the volunteer guide Mdm Leslie gave a full 2 hr explanation to just about every major section of the museum, despite that she was fasting that time! Really appreciated her effort even to just a small group!",
          "The ticketing staff was very friendly and helpful. The staff at the entrance seemed more busy having a conversation among themselves. The artifacts were ok only and could have been more to uphold the status of being a national museum.",
          "Overall experience was okay, not that exciting, just average. Ambiance was nice and clean. However when I went there were no aircond in one of the sections. Learnt a thing or two about the country\u2019s history. I think its a must visit place for tourist. Outer building is nice for",
          "Was lucky to join the English speaking tour at the museum. Anna was an excellent guide who helped us to understand the history of Malaysia. She kept a good pace and registered the mood of the group, so that we were always interested. I was very impressed and feel I now have a",
          "It is adequate and okay rather than wonderful and amazing. You have a bit of a collection but not much compared to most of the national museums. Worth visiting but if on a tight schedule consider other attractions.",
          "Though this doesn't compare to many national museums in other cities, it's definitely worth a visit. There are four main galleries organised chronologically which take you from the ancient history of Malaysia right through to modern day Malaysia. We took the English tour (free)",
          "There were 4 different sections of the museum which all tell a very different story. I learned a lot in a short time here and recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the history of Asia.",
          "The place to learn about the history of Malaysia and more specifically Kuala Lumpur. Something for all the family.",
          "Along our route of the Hop-on Hop off we stopped at the National Museum. The museum is very informative and interesting as it captures the history of ASIA. There are free guided tours. Certainly a stop whilst in KL. Great place to teach children on other cultures and history.",
          "One of our first stop in the tour I got, is this museum. This gave me more knowledge about Malaysia. Walking around here is pretty fun.",
          "One of the better museums in KL in my opinion. Very informative and certainly gave a good overview of the area, its history and development. They are very proud of their independence and reflect on this pretty much everywhere you go. I lost count of the times someone asked me",
          "Me and my wife loved our time at the National Museum. They provide free daily guided tours in English at 10AM, and we came specifically for the tour, and what a tour it was! Supposed to last one hour, our small group asked so many questions about Malaysian history and modern day",
          "A meseum located at nearby KL zsentral where all the trains station is. There also a MRT station in Meseum. It open everyday for visitors. A place where you can see the history of Malaysia and sometimes you can get to see the history of worlds also desplayed in this museum. A",
          "First, I gotta say, the layout of this museum is neat. There's 4 big sections with linear paths so you can see everything without having to backtrack much. The place is also very accessible from the train station. The signages are well done so it was easy to get an understanding",
          "The free museum guide explained all the displaus in great detail, we only had time to go to two of the galleries - Early History & Malay Kingdoms. After knowing the history of Malaysia I have a new found appreciation for the diversity of this country. I really wish I could have",
          "The Museum is very well laid out and the exhibitions and displays are beautifully presented with good interpretation boards. It`s a cool and airy place to visit in the hot climate of Kuala Lumpur and we enjoyed our visit very much.",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the museum and was lucky to attend on a day where there were not many visitors so I had the privilege of a one to one tour in English with museum volunteer and retired teacher Leow Lee Lin who is very knowledgeable about the museum and recent social history",
          "National Museum in Kualalampur is a good experience for visitors coming to Kualalampur. Small place but tidy and full of information about the country and the multy ethnicity culture. There are many good murals and sets etc which the tourists would like to save in the camera.",
          "We came with our girls; 4 and 7. Even though, Malay language is not their first language, the museum has put the English translation strategically for my kids to be able to read them easily. Exhibits are presented in a way that is easy for us to follow even without any tours.",
          "The museum is generally of a high standard with exhibits well presented and interpretation boards providing more than adequate information in good English as well as Malay. This was better than I expected when compared to other countries I have visited. Maintenance and general",
          "The museum is divided into 4 areas over 2 floors. Early history, Malay Kingdoms, Colonial era and Malaysia today. Useful for an overview of history of the area and is good if you are interested in this type of thing. Not so exciting for me.",
          "I took the free English tour, with Rose Chin as tour guide. She was fantastic, and shared a lot of really interesting information. I don't usually like taking tours, but this was was great and I learned SO much and was kept interested and entertained the entire time by Rose. If",
          "I have been here twice now, but the last time was memorable thanks to the free 10:00 tour by Eric Lim. The museum has four parts: Prehistory, Malay kingdoms, Colonisation times and Malaysia's recent history. The museum looks great in design and that items are interesting as well.",

          "Being in the middle of the day, we thought best to spend it at the National Museum. It guides you through around 15 different sections (although there are quite a few repeats), so it is great to learn abit about the history of Sri Lanka and religions. It cost LRK1000 for each of",
          "4Galleries: Pre history, early days, colonial period, Malaysia today. If you had to skip one, make it prehistory. There are lots of interpretative signs (in English as well as Malay). Many display cases that are well lit. I wish there\u2019d been more on the Japanese occupation, but",
          "This is a short distance from KL station however to walk there is a bit of a mission as KL is not greatest pedestrian friendly city in parts. However the museum is a must see in KL. Set in a large airy building the lay out has been done in four sections over two floors.",
          "The museum gives an interesting overview of Malaysia\u2019s history. It is well laid out with most of the information written in English.",
          "Today Leslie, a lovely lady originally from Canada gave us a fascinating tour of the museum. We were limited for time so she covered off the most important parts of the history. Leslie is extremely knowledgable and interesting and we learned so much more than if we had gone",
          "This museum is the best place to learn the history of Malaysia. The four exhibit halls (prehistoric, kingdoms, colonial, and modern era) are well organized. As I previously learned little and had piece-wise information about Malaysia, the information provided here \"fill my",
          "There are four galleries: prehistoric, Malay kingdoms, colonial era, and modern era. They provided a great introduction to the history of the country for a foreigner like me. My driver is a lifelong resident of KL and said he'd never been there. I suggested he take his kids.",
          "I really loved spending the two hours I spent in the museum today! I learned a lot and loved seeing the prehistoric archeological displays. Particularly informative for me was the historic context for the city of Melaka and its importance in so many different areas of history.",
          "A very informative and interesting museum if you are interested to learn more of Malaysia and her history!",
          "I had an hour to kill so I thought I\u2019d check this out. While the entry fee is pretty low, I must say that it was still a bit of a let down. The museum is divided into four sections and this has the effect of creating a certain discontinuity in the overall \u2018narrative\u2019? I didn\u2019t",
          "Worth the visit, the whole experience will make you feel like you travel to the past. Thumbs up to the management, not only they pay attention to the exhibit item, but they transform the section to make us feel like living in that era.",
          "I made two trips: one to the cultural life museum and one to the larger more archaeological museum. This works well as a separate ticket has to be bought for each. The first has silverware, musical instruments, weapons, clothing and the like. I spent some time in there. I was",
          "This is a small museum but worth looking at if you have an interest in the history of Malaysia. It covers prehistory until independence. Not a bad museum and at RM5 it is a cheap bargin.",
          "To engage with the new generation, the museum might need to be more interactive and engaging to it's younger community before it starts to phase out and be totally abandoned.",
          "U must visit this museum if you r interested with history. Two floor and 2 big rooms in each floor including Portugal period.",
          "Visit only if you are a hard core historian. Malaysia has a ver brief history and museum is well-aligned to take you through this short story. Place was not in our bucket list but had a look since we had time. Tickets are affordable. Boring for couples :)",
          "This was one of the best national Museum I have seen I have ever seen. Divided into 4parts mainly show cases 4 different eras of Malaysian history. There is a small video available in zone 4, don't miss it. Entry ticket for foreign travellers are 5RM. Can easily spent",
          "We had limited time so took a quick visit to the museum. There are many transport vehicles on display outside like the first Malaysian car, etc",
          "Nice place to see, needs to have more people with information. No Wi-Fi available. Was told there are some tour guides but couldn't fine one, just walked around by my self.",
          "I enjoy visiting this place. Beforehand I didn't really know Malaysian history. Even though the country was independent in 1957, infrastructure owned was very good such as MRT, LRT etc. If you want to know about the past and present of this country, you must visit this museum",
          "A great museum, with a great value entry price (RM5, about \u20ac1). Four galleries to explore, moving through Malaysia's history. Lots of interesting exhibits and a really good video theatre presentation of Malaysia's declaration of independence from Britain. Nice cafe with good",

          "If you want to know the Malaysia history than this museum is perfect for you guys. This museum was built in 1963.",
          "This museum is set within a museum complex and is well worth a visit. On the ground floor is a very interesting archeological section and upstairs it tells you about colonial rule and Malaysias bid for independence.",
          "This attraction is unmissable from Independence square. Entry was so cheap..only 5 RM. The photos provide a history of the past. Upstairs is an audiovisual to watch and famous photo ops, with amazing digital backgrounds. There were volunteers helping with the photos.",
          "Rich history of last few centuries. Just 5 RM per person. It shows you Malaysa from the ancient history to modern country",
          "Very informative content. The artifacts are mostly excellent. A lot of really interesting and rare items on display. I feel it can still be better but I'm certain Kuala Lumpur is proud of its National Museum.",
          "I joined the tour a few minutes after it started and I was really happy that I decided to join this tour. In just 2 hours, I learnt from more than 1000 years ago to present time Malaysia. I really wanna thank Mr Eric Lim for giving us a fun, enjoyable and meaningful tour!",

          "I coincidentally join the free English tour by Rose Chin at 10 a.m, it was really nice to have her during the tour. The admission fee is only 5RM, but it is definitely worth to visit here before you start journey in Malaysia. You will see the entire culture and history, will",
          "This is a very nice museum. The admission price is 5 MYR and well worth it. It was very interesting and lots of nice exhibits. We spent about an hour here and really enjoyed it.",
          "The museum is great and they did their bestest but nothing really interesting or is it the nation's history is too young !!!",
          "I enjoyed the museum, it is divided into 4 main rooms and times here in Malaysia. There is not huge amounts of information on many items, but pretty comprehensive descriptions on some. Nice place to duck out of the heat or the monsoons in the afternoon. Be sure to wander",
          "This museum offers a walk through Malaysia's history in 4 sections, ancient, cultural influences, colonial and present. Take LRT right to the doorstep and enjoy a leisurely stroll through the 4 sections! Benches to rest for elderly folks!",
          "Feels the info given was too basic and few misinformation. Would be troublesome to explain to the children and tourist on things like : Who is the owner of the objects? Year it found, who found it. Where did it come from ( daggers, households, cutlery n etc Was supposed to",
          "If you\u2019re interested in modern history and the birth and maturity of Malaysia then this is worth a visit. The museum also contains visuals about the geological formation of the earth and this seems to be a common theme of museums in Asia. But understanding the early political",
          "For me the perfect way to better understand the history of this country. Nice quality of objects and good explanation in English",
          "Well worth a visit with plenty to see. There are four main galleries to see and depending on your time available make sure to allow enough time for the areas that are of most interest to you. As you would expect there is a lot of information available about the history of",
          "I've been to the museum twice, personally I love the documentaries on Orang Asli. However, I do feel that there's is a need for the museum to have a renovation and update on most areas. There is more to Malaysia's history than just what was displayed. Each sections should have",
          "Being a history buff, I suggest you get yourself acquainted with Malaysian history first before sight seeing. You need to walk to the main street to find the entrance of the museum. The ticket costs RM5 which is pretty decent. The museum has four different sections, two on each",
          "Interesting little museum and worth a look. Some great exhibits and information about the growth of Malaysia. Loved the fact that there were lots of school children being educated there that day as well.",
          "I know museums are an adult thing, but this museum is manageable. With A B C and D areas, it was made simple for us all.",
          "The nearest station is the MRT Muzium Negara Station, Exit A. The museum consists of four main exhibition; namely the early civilisation of Malaya, the early sultanates, the colonial era and the present Malaysia. Each hall of exhibit tells a concise history of that period of",
          "Only five ringgits to get to the museum. Small but very interesting. Has exhibits going back thousands of years. I was most interested in the colonial eras. Learnt a lot about Malaysian history. Had a good feed of local food in the museum cafe for about ten ringgits. Definitely",
          "This museum is a very good introduction to Malaysia's rich history, culture and traditions. Its housed in an impressive building, the main entry is flanked by a pair of Italian glass mosaic murals; inside there are extensive galleries on the Ground and Upper Floors. View life",
          "My wife and I have been to many museums and had low expectations for this one. Was I surprised. We were fortunate to have a free 2 hour English tour. Our guide Lee Chun Wah was truly outstanding. He shared the entire history of Malaysia starting with artifacts over 200,000 years",
          "Very good museum, laid out on a chronological time line. Accessible by free bus. Our visit was made by Leslie, a volunteer guide who was both knowledgeable and passionate.Has to be one of the best guides we have ever encountered and is passionate about her country.",
          "We enjoyed a super visit to the National Museum and gathered some insight into ancient Malaysian geology, history and artifices before progressing to get some insights to the last 200 years and finally the more present day story of Malaysia",
          "The National Museum is one of the iconic landmarks in Kuala Lumpur. It is located on Jalan Damansara. The building\u2019s architecture bears resemblance to a traditional Malay palace. A clever combination of 13 columns each from the east & west wing reflect the 13 states that form",
          "Housed in a very unusually designed building the exhibits are housed in four separate sections from early evolution to modern day Malay. Exhibits are well described and make a most interesting visit.",
          "This is a must see museum to understand Malaysia with it's diverse culture, rich history and current situation.",
          "Not having visited the museum in over 30 years, I was pleasantly surprised that they have greatly improved the experience for the better. There are 4 galleries covering Pre-historic, the Malay royals galley, the colonial era and finally modern Malaysia after independence. There",
          "The museum houses a really nice collection and the building itself is a work of art, with beautiful reliefs covering the front facades.",
          "Some exhibit are already peeling or missing. I like maps and flags so that's the one I particularly noticed. The flags, emblem of the states are incomplete and worn out. But overall, the museum is a must see for history buffs. The connecting train station is a brilliant idea",

          "Great summary of Malaysian history that covers everything from ancient settlements to WW2, independence and modern times. There are guided tours as well but think it was only once a day - didn't line up with my schedule. Anywhere from 1.5 - 2.5+ hours depending on the person.",
          "I was staying in Hilton for business across the road from this museum and thought to pay a visit on a free day. (If you start from either Hilton or Meridien, I had read posting that you can\u2019t walk there but actually you can. My Grab driver got lost somewhere so I decided to",

          "The museum is attractively laid out with good explanations in English and Malay. It is quite small by the standards of many national museums but, unless you are a specialist, it is large enough. The nearby Orang Asli Museum is also worth visiting with access from there via a",
          "We managed to look around the area for 1 and a half hour. Though, it\u2019s not the best museum I have went, it is certainly something. The pricing for local is only rm 2. I would suggest to check out the museum when there is also an external exhibition at the location next door",
          "Spent an hours or so at the museum with the family on Saturday after breakfast. If you have not been there it is good for one visit, there is nothing much to see but if you wanted a quick crash course at Malaysia history it is worth your visit, maximum 2 hours. Entry fee is very",

          "Kuala Lumpur's National Museum boasts of multiple exhibits which are well-crafted, informative, and truly captivating. A visit to its museum shouldn't be rushed as it takes time to walk through each exhibit and savor its richness. Opt for a multiple-entry ticket as the National",
          "This venue takes time, so if you have 3-4 hours (or more) then consider this venue. The Hop-on-Hop-off bus stops here and the GoKL Red line passes by; otherwise it is a Taxi which is not too expensive, ask first but be aware some taxis are 'no haggle'. The Museum is well laid",
          "Although there are only four sections in the museum, it still provides vast information about the history of Malaysia. I've been to the museum today as a part of a class trip and we were taken on a tour by a volunteer tour guide by the name Adib. He is so patient and detailed",

          "It has 4 sections that cover it all, from the very early stages of human life to today\u2019s Malaysia, passing through the colonial heritage and influences that make the country as we know it today. Great reproductions and artifacts that retrace the history of this amazing country",
          "Definitely the smallest national museum I\u2019ve ever visited. But even in its compact size it could give you a glimpse of how Malaysia was born. Although, to me, the storyline around the British occupation was kind of confusing, the overall storyline did make sense. One thing",

          "I believe for my foreign partner and I (a local) it came to something like RM7 (\u00a31.20). The outside looks a little dull, lacking some upkeep, which upsets me, but on the inside, for a relatively small national museum, it is packed with information. What surprised me was that it",
          "One of the stops on the hop-on, hop-off bus. Also short but complicated walk from KL central. KL is not designed for walking about. Good collection demonstrating long history of the region, from prehistoric times to independence and split with Singapore. I learned a lot.",
          "We were a group of three, and when we entered the museum, Eunice - I think she's a volunteer at 'Museum Volunteers JMM' - came up and asked if we would like a free guided tour by her in English. We were delighted and agreed to it immediately. I think it was indeed a blessing",
          "Museum is not as huge compared to the ones I have been. They showcase the timeline of early human civilisation towards the colonial era and then the modern Malaysia. I would really suggest taking local kids to visit before they take their PMR. Problems encountered: - Not much",
          "Whenever I go to a museum, I usually skip the guided tour in favour of an audio tour if available. But it so happened that we arrived just as the English tour was about to start and we were kindly asked if we wanted to join in. So we did and thoroughly enjoyed the 1 1/2 hr tour.",

          "Had a terrific 1 hour free tour at the national museum with Yee Chun Wah. We saw some wonderful artefacts from pre-paleolithic to now, all explained in an easy going understandable manner. Didn't get to the Orang Asli, my major interest, but next time. The displays were well",
          "If you want to know the history of Malaysia, from prehistoric to modern times, this museum is for you! It costs just five ringette (about \u00a31) to enter. Room one explains how South East Asia's land masses developed, and has displays of early settlers. Room two explains early",
          "Enjoyed the history lessons that we experienced in the various halls and different exhibits. The food in the museum canteen was also very good!",
          "Exhibits here are good to see. But we found this place not as interesting as expected. Pretty much of an average experience.",
          "We took the transit to KL Central but even though the museum is less than 250m away, it was really difficult to get there. You had to cross a 5 lane highway. The museum is a bit dated and could do with some investment to bring displays and information up to modern standards.",
          "I took the 10 am tour in English at the National Museum given by a delightful English lady whose name I've forgotten. She was fabulous and made the history of Malaysia come alive. It was a fascinating 90 minutes and a great introduction to Malaysia. The tour is free and",

          "Very cheap entry and an interesting canter through the history of the country from prehistoric times to independence. Nicely laid out and takes about a hour. We missed the guided tour. Struck us that the place needed more investment and a little more imagination to really",
          "One of the ancient exhibitions made me want to see and visit more of the country than Kuala Lumpur and was interesting to read so much about the polite, correct, peaceful nature of this nation (such a contrast with the museums of Vietnam). The only group that the museum wrote",
          "Sorry to say that despite my love of Malaysia, but don't expect anything... i went there during my ride of hop on hop off bus ... tickets are very cheap but useless... nothing attractive there .. some photos from outside and go , just coins , old clothes and some rocks Poor",
          "There are many different museums nearby in different good-looking unique architectural buildings. They are Muzum Negara, Museum Orange Asli and Museum Entological Seni CRAZ Dunia (Malay Museum) etc. It is closer to the railway Sentral station and it is in front of \u2018St. Regis\u2019",
          "Really near to KL Sentral & Perdana Lake Park. Can go with hop on & off bus. The ticket price very cheap. As long as you want to know when & how Malaysia coming from, can come visit here. All about history. There also have a nice souvenirs shop & clean toilet.",
          "Definitely a must see. The galleries take you from historic Malaysia where you encounter the various countries who have been involved in the country since ancient times, to present day and the Sultans. The museum reminds me of a local, small town museum and certainly does not",
          "Visited for the first time and was not disappointed. The museum really portrays the journey of Malaysia through history, and at the time we visited, they had a shadow puppet exhibit as well which was really nice. You need a good few hours to appreciate the place but it's worth",
          "It's an average museum. If you don't know anything about the history of Malaysia, you might learn a thing or two. Unfortunately, the displays and explanations are fragmented and incomprehensive. The museum's potrayal of Malaysian history falls flat and is disappointing.",
          "more on malaysian diverse culture, 1 hour will do, but most of the time there are many school children around for school trips, quite noisy",
          "Right beside MajesticHotel so it was easy to get to About ten mins walk A great museum and filled with facts and figures about KL . I wanted to buy a book but the shop was disappointing . Staff no interest and shelves half full of tourism style rubbish It was worth doing and",
          "Not a good place, not telling anything about the Malaysian culture as I expected, Mainly about some rocks and very generic representation",
          "Pretty average compared to the other national museums that I have been to in other places. Go if you have time but I wouldn't classify this as a must see by any means - quite boring if I am not, whereas the national museum in Singapore was out of this world!",
          "The National Museum is located near KL Sentral station. It is a walkable distance but we got a little lost and used Uber instead; only to find out that it was a block away from where we were. There's a local and tourist price and price for tourist was only $10rm. The museum",
          "We spent 2 hours listening to this passionate guide, who answered so many of our questions. A fantastic experience!",
          "I was taken out here by the inexpensive Hop On & Off bus. Great way to bone up on your history of Maylasia. I'm going to Malacca after this and I found out the ancient significance of that and many other areas. Nice to know what you're looking at when out and about. Now I know",
          "You are expected to arrive by car or taxi. The museum says it is a 500m walk from KL Sentral Station - but unfortunately there are no signposts, and the route goes through a building site!",
          "We had expected it would be a great museum in a historical building but Muzium Negara was a bit boring to us with 4 galleries in an old building. The museum was small. The best thing about it was its location: next to a big park and few minutes to KL Sentral.",
          "A great museum with lots of information on Malaysian, history and Independance and also lots of wonderful artefacts. Four galleries within the building, two on the ground floor and two on the first floor. I loved the wooden handrail on the staircase to the upper floor. I",
          "The place is worth it for people who loves history, doesn't matter whether you are a local or a tourist, you will learn a lot about our country here. If you are studying Sejarah (History) like me, you will find the actual objects like the parang keris in here, they also have",
          "We were surprised to see a lot of information about Malaysia. Particularly the days they did fight against Dutch.",
          "If like us you are a little ignorant of how Malaya became Malaysia a visit to the Museum is well worthwhile. Just avoid the loos which are a disgrace,",
          "In the National Museum, we received an excellent and unforgettable tour from Mrs. Eunice Moss. She was sitting on a bench with her 'free guided tour' sign and asked us if we were interested. Mrs. Moss asked us what our special interests were (modern history) and started her",

          "It's a good place for foreigners to learn about Malaysia history from Malaya and becoming Malaysia, to know the leaders and how we come independent and also to learn about our rich multi racial cultures. There are 4 galleries each with its theme. Once you enter you can help but",
          "Spent an hour or two in the National Museum in KL today. It was one of the stops on the Hop on Hop Off bus tour. Learnt a lot about the history of Malaysia all presented in an interesting way - four big rooms of displays covered the entire Malaysian history. At five ringits,",

          "I went to the museum on a Saturday and the crowd is just okay. Not too crowded. It is very accessible through public transport. It is very informative with interesting displays. I am really satisfied with the shadow puppet exhibition. The displays are great with projector",
          "A complete museum. From pre-historic to present. Not a large area. Most of the things are statues and replicas. Original historic items are rare. This place is fine for a scholar who wants to know the evolution of Malaysian kingdom and its culture and traditions from colonial to",

          "This was a pretty decent museum in the old days but it has slowly gone down hill together with other poorly managed Malaysian institutions due to short sighted government policies. Their collection by international standards is small but there are some gems particularly on Malay",

          "Every time we visit a country, my wife and I try to learn about the natural history. Today we visited Malaysia's national museum and we were not disappointed. We loved the fact that there plentiful exhibits but not so many that it became tiresome. And we learned so much about",
          "Museum Negara or the National Museum is not a very popular destination for locals. No one talks about visiting the museum and it is a shame to miss out on the country's historical relics. perhaps it is time the museum undergo a revamp and is spruced up the way the Met in New",

          "It wasn't my plan to have a trip here, it just so happens my roommate wanted to visit the museum, and I didn't have much to do anyway. It turned out to be a good visit. It shows history that shaped Malaysia to what it is now, from the prehistoric times, the life of the royals,",

          "I an only strongly recommend the FREE guided tours of the National Museum. I did the one in English but some are in French too. The guides are volunteers but very well trained. Without the guide the visit would have been ordinary, with her it was great! Thank you.",
          "This Muzium is one of the best thing I have seen so far. The overall concept of splitting the section wrt ages is impressive and it makes it easier to understand. It's not a very old Muzium but still the maintenance of the premise may disappoint u. The operation of lift was",
          "Honestly, I have been to museums with more artifacts in India. But this one is very well organized. And very cheap too. RM 5 for foreigners. Photography is allowed. I would recommend u spend 2 hours at this museum. There are 4 galleries: 1. Prehistoric until about 700 A.D. 2.",

          "TIP 1: Don't waste your money on the tiny Museum of ethnography next door and sold from the same ticket booth, as it has almost no exhibits, and what it does have, better examples are in the main National Museum. Tip 2: There are 4 galleries - what to see Gallery 1",

          "Ground floor was really interesting.  And decreases alphabetically.  But it's a RM2 affair, so that's as much as it goes. Though I really expected more from a national museum.",
          "One thing you must do when visiting another country is visit their museum. National museum is no exception either.\nIt's beautifully maintained and would take you through entire history of Malaysia from dark age to modern day.\nTicket is 5RM per person and is absolutely amazing.",
          "not the most interesting museum, but if you have time you should go. it\u2019s cheap and you will probably learn a lot.",

          "Well prepared exhibition. Recomend taking free guided tour \ud83d\ude43",
          "The National Museum still maintains its lustre even after decades of operation. Very well maintained, clean and cheap. For Malaysians it is still RM2 per entry for 12 year old and above. For non-Malaysians, it is only RM5 for an adult \u2026",
          "I been to this place frequently. As im thirsty for knowledges, muzium negara is a perfect place for to learn about the history.",

          "We enjoyed this musuem as it well laid out meaning as you when from room to room you learnt about a different era and impact of history from ancient to modern. Learnt a lot and exhibts were good. \nThey did have a bit of annoying policy \u2026",

          "A fairly smaller museum than most countries. But it's only 5 RM and worth a stop",
          "I learnt a lot about Japanese history at this museum. I am Japanese but had never seen the bills Japanese government issued from 1941 to 1945 here. I would thank the museum for their fairness and rational exhibit about such a history.",
          "Price is cheap which is good . More can be done by explaining the \u201chistory\u201d behind the exhibit rather than just describing the exhibits itself. Malaysia has a much larger history than what is depicted. A little dissapointed .",
          "Quite a small museum, in fact the smallest national museum I have ever been to. I won't compare this museum to other countries museum because not much information is included. The toilet costs money to use, but the ticket for museum is cheap. There is no need to come here unless you have no place to go.",

          "Gives some good insights into Malaysia's history and people, but limited in scope (no history of the orang asli in the main museum). Also some dates are inconsistent (fall of Melaka 11th Aug or 25th?). Still recommended to satisfy any \u2026",

          "Starting on a positive note, the entry fee of 5 ringgit is nice. But from exibition pov, I expected more. Rather than focussing on stone age exhibition, they could have simply done away with that and covered more of the historical/cultural \u2026",

Thr most fasinating collection was the golden tree with golden flowers and leaves.",

          "I thought the room themes were well curated, relevant and reflected well on a national museum. However, Management needs to upgrade the shop, which is full of kitsch trinkets and has no books on Malaysian history. It really looks like an amateur operation. Surely the government can create its own imprint of high quality books?",

          "It was a nice visit if you are looking for an educational tour about ancient and current malaysian history as it covers from the beginning of time. I spent about 2 to 3 hours here to cover the four  galleries. There were also other interesting things to visit around the area.",
          "Cheap place to bring the kids and easily spend a few hours here. The MRT station is right in front of the entrance hence it's easily accessible. Only thing is most of the exhibits are the same since maybe more than 5 years ago nevertheless still good place to spend with the kids",

          "Very nice museum, interactive and well prepared to receive tourists",
          "Quite a small museum divided into four sections, not much to see given that colonial and post-colonial Malaysia is a very young country. You can finish the walk and review in just one to two hours maximum. I think they should expand with flora & fauna, and other stuff animals native to the country. The place need a lot of improvement.",
          "4 exhibition halls. Really good for the price - about $1. Can finish it in about 2-3 hours.",
          "Confused section, no air conditioning when i visited so hot inside.",

          "Exhibits were small and limited, I felt that the modern Malaysia part was uninteresting. I was expecting to see more historical information on colonisation",
          "A small but well laid out museum documenting the history of Malaysia from the distant past to current day. Easy to get to by train and a reasonable admission fee.",
          "Quite boring. Nothing much to see. Old collections. Been here a few times, nothing's changed.Would be better if you go to the Islamic Art Museum. They have better collection",

The same-time Japanese tour was more interesting even if I only half-understood it.",

          "lots of information,,but good enough for my school project",
          "Great place to learn history instead of sitting in the classroom and read textbook. BTW, citizen price is cheap af so it's worth it to spend your day there with RM2 to upgrade your knowledge and appreciate your country or you may prefer to spend at least RM20 to upgrade your hipster-ness",

          "Amazing place\nBut People Working there are Little bit careless",
          "What to be expected out a muzeum if you're a history buff like yours truly. But when I was there, some of the exhibit are not available. Probably because of some technical issues but still, a good place to study up the history of Malaysia.",

        "wiki": "Batu Caves (Tamil: \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bb2\u0bc8) is a  limestone hill that has a series of caves and cave temples in Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia. It takes its name from the Malay word batu, meaning 'rock'. Batu Caves is also the name of a nearby town.\nThe cave is one of the most popular Hindu shrines outside India, and is dedicated to Lord Murugan. It is the focal point of the Hindu festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia.\nBatu Caves in short also referred as 10th Caves or Hill for Lord Muruga as there are six important holy shrines in India and four more in Malaysia. The three others in Malaysia are Kallumalai Temple in Ipoh, Tanneermalai Temple in Penang and Sannasimalai Temple in Malacca.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe limestone forming Batu Caves is said to be around 400 million years old. Some of the cave entrances were used as shelters by the indigenous Temuan people (a tribe of Orang Asli).\nAs early as 1860, Chinese settlers began excavating guano for fertilising their vegetable patches. However, they became famous only after the limestone hills were recorded by colonial authorities including Daly and Syers as well as American Naturalist, William Hornaday in 1878.\nBatu Caves was promoted as a place of worship by K. Thamboosamy Pillai, an Indian trader. He was inspired by the vel-shaped entrance of the main cave and was inspired to dedicate a temple to Lord Murugan within the caves. \nIn 1890, Pillai, who also founded the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur, installed the murti (consecrated statue) of Sri Murugan Swami in what is today known as the Temple Cave. Since 1892, the Thaipusam festival in the Tamil month of Thai (which falls in late January/early February) has been celebrated there.\nWooden steps up to the Temple Cave were built in 1920 and have since been replaced by 272 concrete steps. Of the various cave temples that comprise the site, the largest and best known is the Temple Cave, so named because it houses several Hindu shrines beneath its high vaulted ceiling.\nIn August 2018 the 272 steps were painted in an extraordinary colour scheme, with each set of steps painted in a different range of colours. However, accusations were almost immediately made by the National Heritage Department for a breach of law requiring authorisation for renovations within 200 metres of a heritage site. The temple's management disputed their failure to receive authorisation.\n\n\n== Religious site ==\n\nRising almost 100 m above the ground, the Batu Caves temple complex consists of three main caves and a few smaller ones. The biggest, referred to as Cathedral Cave or Temple Cave, has a very high ceiling and features ornate Hindu shrines. To reach it, visitors must climb a steep flight of 272 steps.\nAt the base of the hill are two more cave temples, Art Gallery Cave and Museum Cave, both of which are full of Hindu statues and paintings. This complex was renovated and opened as the Cave Villa in 2008. Many of the shrines relate the story of Lord Murugan's victory over the demon Soorapadman. An audio tour is available to visitors.\nThe Ramayana Cave is situated to the extreme left as one faces the sheer wall of the hill. On the way to the Ramayana Cave, there is a 15 m (50 ft) tall statue of Hanuman and a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman, devotee and aide of Lord Rama. The consecration ceremony of the temple was held in November 2001.\nThe Ramayana Cave depicts the story of Rama in a chronicle manner along the irregular walls of the cave.\nA 42.7-metre (140 ft) high statue of Lord Murugan was unveiled in January 2006, having taken 3 years to construct. It is the tallest Lord Murugan statue in the world.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nBatu Malai Sri Murugan Temple is managed by the Board of Management of Sri Maha Mariamman Temple Devasthanam, which also manages the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur and the Kortumalai Pillaiyar Temple. It also performs the role of Hindu Religious Consultant to the Government of Malaysia in determining the Hindu yearly calendar.\n\n\n== Nature, flora and fauna ==\n\nThere are various undeveloped caves which contain a diverse range of cave fauna, including some unique species, such as Liphistius batuensis spiders and Eonycteris and fruit bats. The site is also well known for its numerous long-tailed macaques, which visitors feed \u2014 sometimes involuntarily.  These monkeys may also pose a biting hazard to tourists (especially small children) as they can be quite territorial.\nBelow the Temple Cave is the Dark Cave, with rock formations and a number of animals found nowhere else. It is a two-kilometer network of relatively untouched caverns. Stalactites jutting from the cave's ceiling and stalagmites rising from the floor form intricate formations such as cave curtains, flowstones, cave pearls and scallops which took thousands of years to form.\nIn order to maintain the cave's ecology, access is restricted. The Malaysian Nature Society organises regular educational and adventure trips to the Dark Wet Caves.\n\n\n=== Butterfly Checklist ===\nChecklist of Butterflies Surveyed at Batu Caves, Kuala Lumpur, by Dr Rosli Omar (with identification and verification help from Professor Yong Hoi Sen of Universiti Malaya, and Sofwan Badr), arranged taxonomically:\n\nPsyche.

Batu Caves offers more than 160 climbing routes. The routes are scattered all around the side of Batu Caves, which is made up of limestone hills rising to 150 m. These climbing routes are easily accessed, as most crags start from ground level. These climbing routes often start from the North Eastern side of the cave complex whereas the staircase and temple entrance faces South. This Northeastern area is known as the Damai caves. Abseiling and spelunking trips can be organised with some local adventure companies.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\n\nThe Batu Caves serve as the focus of the Hindu community's yearly Thaipusam (Tamil: \u0ba4\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bc2\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd) festival. They have become a pilgrimage site not only for Malaysian Hindus, but Hindus worldwide.\nA procession begins in the wee hours of the morning on Thaipusam from the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur leading up to Batu Caves as a religious undertaking to Lord Muruga lasting eight hours. Devotees carry containers containing milk as offering to Lord Murugan either by hand or in huge decorated carriers on their shoulders called 'kavadi'.\nThe kavadi may be simple wooden arched semi-circular supports holding a carrier foisted with brass or clay pots of milk or huge, heavy ones which may rise up to two metres, built of bowed metal frames which hold long skewers, the sharpened end of which pierce the skin of the bearers torso. The kavadi is decorated with flowers and peacock feathers imported from India. Some kavadi may weigh as much as a hundred kilograms.\nAfter bathing in the nearby Sungai Batu (Rocky River), the devotees make their way to the Temple Cave and climb the flights of stairs to the temple in the cave. Devotees use the wider centre staircase while worshippers and onlookers throng up and down those balustrades on either side.\nWhen the kavadi bearer arrives at the foot of the 272-step stairway leading up to the Temple Cave, the devotee has to make the arduous climb.\nPriests attend to the kavadi bearers. Consecrated ash is sprinkled over the hooks and skewers piercing the devotees' flesh before they are removed. No blood is shed during the piercing and removal.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nHousing development began around 1970 with housing estates such as Taman Batu Caves, Taman Selayang, Taman Amaniah, Taman Sri Selayang, Taman Medan Batu Caves, and Taman Gombak Permai.\nIn the last decade, the surrounding area has changed from a small village to industrial estates, new housing, and retail. There is also an elevated flyover across the highway. A new 515-million-ringgit KTM Komuter rail extension from Sentul to Batu Caves began operations in July 2010, serving the rebuilt Batu Caves Komuter station.\nOn 1 January 2011, during the Thaipusam festival, it was announced that a cable car would be built for the following year's festival. It would cost around 10 million ringgit.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nBatu Caves is easily reached by commuter train at the  KC05  Batu Caves Komuter station, costing  RM 2.6 for a one-way journey from  KA01   KS01   KJ15   MR1   KE1   KT1   SBK15  KL Sentral. Batu Caves may also be reached by bus 11/11d from Bangkok Bank Terminus (Near to Puduraya Terminus) or bus U6 from Titiwangsa. Batu Caves is also easily reached by travelling by car.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMalaysian Indian\nIndian Singaporean\nKavadi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBatu Caves Famous Murugan Temple outside India, Hindu Devotional Blog.\nMurugan.org - Batu Caves\nHow to get to Batu Caves - KLSentral.info\nBatu Caves Thaipusam Official Page\nThaipusam at Batu Caves, Malaysia\nCave fauna\nRock Climbing in Batu Caves\nThe Batu Caves in Malaysia\nBatu Caves\nBatu Caves Tour",

They are named for the Sungai Batu (Batu River), which flows nearby, and are located 7 miles (13 km) north of Kuala Lumpur, the  capital of Malaysia.Batu Caves: Lord Murugan statueLord Murugan statue, Batu Caves, near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\u00a9 Bianda Ahmad Hisham/Shutterstock.comThe caves were little-known except to local residents until 1878, when the American naturalist William Temple Hornaday revealed their existence to the wider world. K. Thamboosamy Pillay, a leader of the Tamil Hindu community in Malaya (as the region was then called), built a temple within the caves in 1891. It is said that he took inspiration from the similarity in shape of the cave entrance to the tip of the vel, or spear, traditionally wielded by the deity Murugan. Thaipusam, the Tamil Hindu festival devoted to Murugan, was first celebrated on the site in 1892 and is now a major event that attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually.The Batu Caves are located within a high limestone outcropping. A colossal gold-painted statue of Murugan, made from reinforced concrete and 140 feet (42.7 metres) in height, stands near the base of a flight of 272 steps. As visitors climb the steps, they are frequently accosted by macaques begging aggressively for food. At the top of the steps is the entrance to the largest cave, called Cathedral Cave or Temple Cave.  Within it is the largest of several temples on the site. At a lower level on the flight of steps is Dark Cave, which is sometimes closed to visitors. Other caves lie still closer to the base of the steps. Ramayana Cave has an entrance marked with a statue of the monkey god Hanuman, hero of the Indian epic poem Ramayana. The cave itself is lined with dioramas depicting scenes from the epic. The Cave Villa, which includes Art Gallery Cave and Museum Cave, features more paintings and statues. ",

          "One of the must see places in KL. The caves are huge and the monkeys are everywhere. Make sure your legs are covered otherwise you will need to rent a pashmina to cover your legs. A dirty one.",
          "Obviously it is a must go place in KL, we used private driver and I am glad we did. Not sure how otherwise we would find a regular cab back to city in that chaotic place. Also, I like to recommend the caves on the left side of the entrance, before you climb the steps. You pay",
          "The caves are fascinating! My husband climbed up to 275 steps to the Batu cave while I went to another Cave nearby called the Ramayan which has an interesting legend told by a local tourist. Saw many monkeys running around with their baby hanging on their belly while they eat",
          "This is an obvious must see if visiting Kuala Lumpur. Closer to the city center than I thought but very cool sight to behold with a great history.",
          "Give yourself lots of time, the traffic is chaos, very very busy with people, very hot, wear sneakers, take water, if you want to climb the stairs & you are female wear clothing below the knees, if you don't you can rent a sarong for 5ringgit & be refunded 2ringgit when you are",
          "A huge statue of Budha and the 272 stairs to climb along many people and monkeys, inside a cave with temples and lot of friendly monkeys who can eat and drink almost everithisng.A must do experience.",
          "Watch the Youtube videos - it lives up to them! So lively and colourful. BUT ALSO once you are back down and with your back to the main golden statue turn right and head towards the rail station. There are lots of other really cool caves down there too.",
          "Stinky, filthy beauty. Going to the caves made us sad. Such great potential, and amazing grottos all wrapped in stink and filth. Garbage all around so u basically need to climb garbage before climbing to the caves. Such a shame....",
          "We caught the train to Batu Caves - and WOW what a destination! There are two highlights here - the Ramayana Temple and the Batu Caves Lord Murugan Temple. If you take the train there, get off and walk to the East. First stop is the Ramayana Cave Temple. Pay to go inside - a",
          "we love this place very much according to our religon and our previous generations also follow them. its the place where we think its our peace. if you are in kulalumpur then must visit this beautiful place.",
          "We missed the Batu caves and temple on our last visit to Kuala Lumpar, and so it was first on our list on this visit. We organised a taxi with our hotel to take us to the caves, which was extremely reasonable at under \u00a34. We made our own way back to the city on the local train,",
          "It\u2019s a short drive from KL city center but the traffic gets heavy when you\u2019re almost to the cave. It\u2019s better to visit in the morning or late afternoon as it\u2019s really hot plus the exhilaration of the climb could really get you winded unless you are really looking forward on a",
          "Neat place to visit. The inside of the caves is underwhelming, but the climb up is worth it. We went on a very rainy day so there were very few people and almost no one inside the caves. The metro stops right at one of the entrances so it is very easy to get to and from the",
          "This a religious place for most of the visitors. But for others also, its an interesting place to visit and experience the place. I have been here few times. the food from the stalls outside is superb.",
          "Great monkeys, cave was little bit disapointing. You can easily book grab from city center to caves!",
          "This is a must-visit place to go if you are in Kuala Lumpur. It's only slightly north of the city. We visited during the Thaipusam festival, which meant that there were a lot of people selling food and arts and crafts. We also got to see a lot of Hindu people going to the caves",
          "We took a tour from our cruise into Kuala Lumpur and had a stop at Batu Caves. We had heard about how stunning this is but it is beyond stunning. You first see the gigantic gleaming gold statue, then the colourful stairs that lead to the temples and caves, spectacular. If you",
          "Got there about midday which was too hot in hindsight but spectacular sight. Beware of the frail old man asking for help to carry a case of bottled water to the shop at the top! It is hard to carry in that heat and they have plenty up there. Smelly when you get to top.",
          "One of the interesting places I have visited Stairs are quite difficult to climb as in some parts very stiff. Inside the cave it is cool feeling weather.",
          "Worth a visit especially as it\u2019s a main Hindu temple in the region. Get a taxi as it cheaper than through an agent as it\u2019s only 15 mins from central KL. Half day enough to visit. Plenty of monkeys so expect it to smell a bit when your inside the caves.",
          "The south Indian temple at the foot of the Batu caves entrance is enchanting with bright colors, expressive statues of various gods.. !! One needs a lot of courage to climb up the stairs but then, I think it was worth the efforts. Cleanliness is wanting at the entrance though.",
          "While in KL we were looking for fun things to do and ways to take in the culture. As any visitor to KL knows, the malls are great, the hotels are great, but you gotta get out of that bubble to experience the real culture in KL. And to me our visit to Batu Caves was exactly that.",
          "I had a few hours to kill in Kuala Lumpur on my layover to Sydney so I decided to visit the caves. Once you get through customs, its a really quick and easy train ride to the caves. It is a must do if in KAL.",
          "We visited the Batu caves and got some great photos, it\u2019s very memorable but there is a lot of rubbish and it\u2019s quite smelly. I would recommend going but it doesn\u2019t take long to look around the caves. Also be very careful of the monkeys which will steal food, water, cameras etc.",
          "The Batu Caves are a series of caves in a limestone hill that have been used as Hindu temples and shrines. Specifically it\u2019s dedicated to Lord Murugan, the Hindu God of War and the son of Parvati and Shiva. The entrance to the caves is at the bottom of a hill where there\u2019s also",
          "We were in a rush so thought we'd take a cab. Took 30 minutes while the train back took less. Train is a five minute walk. Definitely hot when you're walking up the 272 steps to the Temple Cave. Make sure to cover knees/shoulders. Cave is cool to see. We did not do the dark cave",
          "We have turned up two days after a big festival.. the filth and rubbish and smell were beyond revolting... given that we are in the midst of a possible pandemic I can\u2019t believe that the KL gov have allowed this place to fester for 2 days.. I have travelled around Asia for months",
          "This place was a nice little detour and cheap to get to even from the middle of KL with a Grab. I went early for the sunrise which made the whole place more beautiful, with the light coming in from the right of the statue and the stairs still shaded for the climb up. Added",
          "I was lucky enough to visit here during the Indian Thaipusam Festival. Huge crowds, lots of colour and noisy but so worthwhile. Train delivers you right at the front door.",
          "One of the most important landmarks in Malaysia, a place that must be in the checklist when traveling to Malaysia yet not so many things to see.. so many people during the weekend.",
          "I had the privilege to share with you pictures of Batu Caves before sunrise. Hope you enjoy them. I experienced the Chariot Walk today which started from 10pm last night to 5am this morning because of the Taipusam festival. Challenging indeed!",
          "Such an amazing experience at the Batu Caves. We even saw some Hindus beginning their sacrifice for Thaipusam",
          "Love going to Batu Caves as once a year, you can see colours, beautiful people fulfilling their vows, and beautiful kavadis..Those who wanna visit Malaysia at this time, should surely visit Batu Caves during this time..",
          "One of the lovely location not to be missed Had a wonderful time after prayer there Got a few vegetarian food place which aren't too bad",
          "It\u2019s a place you can\u2019t miss being in KL Even the cave is not as impressive as expected But the huge statue, the big cave cathedral and of course all the apes around. It\u2019s very hard to park there - so either come early, by tour or public transportation",
          "If you can only visit two things while you're in KL, then go to the twin towers, and go to Batu Caves. Yes, of course there are a lot of steps, but the cave once you get there, is worth exploring. If you're lucky you might have a peek on a festival there. It is a cultural",
          "When I saw the Batu caves in a magazine I couldn't wait to explore them. So we went to Kuala Lumpur from Singapore on a luxury coach. When we arrived at the base of the Batu caves, we couldn't wait to walk to the top. It was a sight for sore eyes. Climbing the stairs was",
          "We got a taxi to go see the caves ourselves. It was about midday so pretty hot but not too over crowded. The gold statue was good to see and after the 300 stairs it was good to go inside and see into the caves. At this time of day there weren\u2019t too many monkeys or birds up the",
          "Well what can I say!!!! This is a so called beauty spot!!!! All I can say is that it was horrific, I have never seen so much rubbish and squalor!!! Clearly no one who visits has any respect!! Disgusting, I wouldn't recommend it!!",
          "Hey, one of the few things that is free. Easy to get there, It is actually on the outskirts of KL No need to catch the tourist bus there. Catch the mono rail to grand central, then find platform 5 and 6. Wait for you train (every 30 mins). Beware the trains leave from both",
          "We used the local train line to the caves from the city which was quite straightforward. Many many steps up to the caves- beware of the monkeys! Dress code applies. Enjoyed walking about inside, it was different and not seen anything like it before, again watch the monkeys -",
          "The climb to the top of 273 steps was invigorating. Entertainment of sorts by the monkeys stealing whatever they can from unsuspecting visitors. Best to do in early hours and late afternoon unless you fo not mind the heat.",
          "The Golden Color and Height give the Gigantic Lord Murugan the aura of strength and beauty.One of the well maintained young Hindu Temples,it is. Once u climb the quick steep steps enjoy your Darshan of two temples inside. Allocate 2.30 to 3 hrs exclusively for the Batu cave",
          "The giant golden Indian deity does look awesome and the caves are beautiful, but with the sheer number of people, aggressive monkeys outside, dirty pigeons inside, and discarded trashes everywhere, that all drastically took away the enjoyment factor.",
          "Do yourself a favour and go on a cloudy day or even rainy. It takes some time to get up those steps, even if your fit because it\u2019s just so hot during the day. Do bring a sweat towel and a drink before going up, you\u2019re going to need it. This place makes for good pictures and it\u2019s",
          "This is a must see place. I loved it. You have to walk up about 272 stairs which was difficult in the heat but was worth it. The temples in the caves are nice to see and the culture experience.",
          "You can never say you've been in Kuala Lumpur if you've never visited this site. The towering statue of Murugen alone is worth the trip, if all you're after is a selfie or a decent photo with it on the background. Those 252 steps aren't that bad as some might describe it, just",
          "We really enjoyed our times in the caves. It is very impressive and the temples inside are not to be missed. You climb up a lot of stairs and then can see the expanse of the caves. We really enjoyed the monkeys who live inside. It is always fun to see them and how they scare the",
          "Spend the time to go here, you won't be disappointed. We walked up the steps to the Caves, quite a few steps but worth it. Don't worry too much about the monkeys, they keep to themselves. Have a look around the whole temple complex while you are there. It is easy to get to -",
          "You have to make the effort to visit here, it\u2019s truly memorable and was a highlight of our tour. We got a return taxi from KL central for 100 MYR. We spent over an hour here climbing the 300 steps and viewing the cave itself, it\u2019s totally unique and the monkeys were well behaved!",
          "I would like to recommend this Batu Caves for all my fellow Filipinos who'll planning to visit Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. It's very cheap to go here in Batu Caves for around 2.60 ringgit from KL Sentral to Batu Caves via KTM Kommuter. When I saw the wonders of Batu Caves. I was so",
          "We did a self tour here to avoid being rushed - we negotiated a taxi at a good price - in KL taxis do not use the meter - the Cave, it is only one as the Dark cave is now closed, is very impressive with a Hindu Temple in the large first chamber and a second smaller chamber up",
          "A friend visited the Batu caves some months ago and told me not to visit the caves due to monkey and bird poo. I\u2019m so glad I took no notice as it was a fantastic experience. We travelled to the caves via the train from KL central which was extremely cheap. The caves are a 2",
          "First the advice: have nothing in your hands- no water, no snacks, no cellphones. Batu Caves Hindu Shrine and henna with my best girls. The temple was pure, beautiful eye candy! But the monkeys... Monkeys are devilish imps sent by Satan. Don\u2019t think you can make friends with",
          "The Batu Caves are one of the top tourist attractions in Kuala Lumpur. It is surrounded of giant stalactites and stalagmites and also found inside the caverns of a huge limestone hill that was formed over 400 million years ago. You must climb 272 steps to a cave in a granite",
          "Great place and well worth the trip from KL. The limestone hills are stunning and the temple is spectacular in its setting. Plenty of monkeys wandering around and the view is great from the top. Make sure you\u2019re prepared for the stairs up though. They are reasonably step for",
          "It was a great place to bring your foreigner friends as Batu Caves have a lot to offer. From the big gold statue (sacred place for the Hindus), it also home to cute monkeys and bats. Behind the cave is Gua Damai Extreme Park where you can opt for some abseiling, climbing etc. Do",
          "We went on a tour to the Batu cave which is around 9km fro KLCC It is set in a limestone hills and has three caverns. There is a towering statue of Murugan which you cannot help but be amazed by. To enter the cave you need to climb 272 steps, not easy in the blistering heat,",
          "Such a stunning place to visit But compared to the city here is a bit chaotic and on the top of the cave is too much modern works, which makes the cave not just simple astonishing at all.",
          "We took a Grab and it was very cheap and straight to the site. Very beautiful site and worth the walk (climb) to the top. Monkeys would steal anything including water bottles. We stopped at Batu on way to Genting Highlands so made a day of it.",
          "Beautiful and mostly important I didn\u2019t spend a penny here! Finally a place in Malaysia where you don\u2019t have to spend loads of money to visit! Just beware of the monkeys one pooped on my son\u2019s backpack and another stole a camera from a tourist the day we went to visit!",
          "This is an extraordinary place that must be seen is you are in KL. Redone every 12 years, revisit if you haven't in a while.",
          "This place was the highlight of Kuala Lumpur and is something noone should miss. Its a beautiful temple filled with statues and all sorts of birds. And the place is infested with monkeys. The monkeys are of course one of the most interesting parts of the place, but don't feed",
          "You will amazed to see one of the largest statue of lord murugan in a islamic country but this is called saving of culture. malaysian government changed their rules for this statue although batu caves are famous for its bats and kartikey temple. you have to climb numbers of",
          "We got a grab taxi from KL only cost 22 ringgit,arrived at 10am and it was very busy but reasonably cool,hard walk to top for us oldies but worth it,temple was amazing just be aware that monkeys can be aggressive.",
          "We took the hop on and hop off bus to this site. It was quite expensive on the bus. It s cheaper by train. I was not too impressed about taking photographs of the temple because it was not kept clean and well maintained. The shrine downstairs was not opened. One has to climb the",
          "We visited this past Saturday. Took the KTM train from Pasar Seni. Took about an hour to get there though. Grab is faster I hear. The caves and temples are interesting and colorful. The monkeys are entertaining both because of their behaviour and the behaviour of the humans",
          "I went there at the evening,but I think it\u2019s better to go there in the morning.you will see that big famous golden status and colorful stairs! Overall I recommend to go there for 1-2 hours ,it\u2019s about 30-40 minutes away from city center.",
          "It was a surprise that the caves we're about an hour's drive from K.L, and you can also get to them by rail from Kuala Lumpur Central and walk the short distance. They are free to climb the approximately 250 steps, there are Temple and shops at the ground level. There are no",
          "Our tour guide took us to Batu Caves. Didn't see any bats but a lot of monkeys.Enjoyed the multi-cultural aspect of Malaysia. Very colourful architectures.",
          "Very nice place for the whole family. Lots of fun with those monkeys around. Very colorful place with lots of steps and nice view.",
          "This was a very a wonderful way to immerse yourself in the Hindi Culture. I learned so much coming to the caves, and reflect on everything we saw here today. It is important to do the steps to the cave as well as the cave off to the far left (if you are looking at the base of",
          "Went from by Petronas towers where we were staying to visit Batu caves. As it was super hot we opted for a cab. The driver took us there and waited while we climbed the many steps up into the caves. He then took us back to our hotel all for Rm120. Of course you can do this",
          "We used Grab app to go there and it was so cheap to get there. You can download this app to go everywhere. I don\u2019t think you need to hire a guide to be there if you google and ready history about it. It took us 1hr to see everything. We went there at 8am on Sunday and it wasn\u2019t",
          "If you are in Malaysia do make time to visit it, just around 25 mins away from the city by cab. It was only during my 3rd time in Malaysia that I visited this sacred placed. Guarded by a monumental statue of Hindu deity Lord Murugan, these limestone caves harbour Hindu temples",
          "We LOVED those caves. Its the fact that a place of worship (beautiful Hindu temples) is situated in a natural landscape (caves) that makes it so special. Its just like 40 mins away by train from the KL Sentral that also lets you see something outside of the Old Town only. THe",
          "Great experience when in KL. Whether visiting or living here, one should make the trek into the caves. Also along the side there is a smaller cave that one needs to visit as well.",
          "Batu Caves is a limestone hill that has a series of caves and cave temples in Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia. It takes its name from the Sungai Batu, which flows past the hill. It is the tenth limestone hill from Ampang.",
          "Super good place , need only 2-3 hours. Just take GRAB taxi and reach. Caves are mesmerising and hanuman idol are beautiful. There is Ramayana cave which tells the full story of Ramayan. Very good for young kids.",
          "it's 272 steps to the top and worth the trip. beware of the monkeys - they're a little aggressive (one grabbed onto my water bottle and i didn't fight him for it). make sure your knees and shoulders are covered. we didn't go to the dark cave - supposed to be very interesting but",
          "Batu Caves is one of the most instagrammable places in Malaysia and the reason is quite obvious. 200+ bright multicolored stairs leading up to a gorgeous temple built inside a limestone cave. The light coming from the opening inside the cave looks as if the heavens have opened",
          "We joined a tour to the Batu Caves and spent an afternoon exploring the Hindu temple within the caves located halfway up a hill. The caves can only be accessed via steep stairs that you have to climb. Fortunately, there are landings every dozen steps or so so you can rest and",
          "The colourful steps and the inside are really nice. We arrived at 8am, time of one of the \"prayers\" ( if i can say so )which was nice to watch. Took the komuter from chinatown (2,50Rm each : 0,60$). No entry fee for the caves.",
          "We and my filipina girl friend made a visit to this temple that is situated inside a cave. From where we were staying in Kuala Lumpur it took around 30 minutes to get there in a Grab taxi. At the entrance you can't miss the giant gold Hindu statue. You will also notice a lot of",
          "I think the most spectacular view is from the bottom when you look up at the multi-coloured steps alongside the gleaming gold statue of Lord Murugan. The cave behind is impressive and I love the open air at the back of the chamber. Cave Villa isn\u2019t with the 15RM, but Ramanaya",
          "It's easy to get to this place under your own steam - we used grab and the cost was very cheap. Very busy during peak hours and monkeys roaming freely so take care. It's worth the trek up the stairs to the cave at the top and the golden buddha is a very impressive sight.",
          "We visited early December and were amazed how beautiful this temple is. absolutely breathtaking and worth the visit. We took a grab and was not too expensive, we also went early based on reviews read. it was much quieter and we got to take in the beauty of the caves as well as",
          "There are a number of tour operators arranging trips to the cave, but it's so simple and cheap to do it yourself by train. The train goes from Kuala Lumpur Sentral and Batu is the last stop. It only takes around 30 minutes, and costs peanuts. The station is right by the cave,",
          "Easy to go by train. Free entrance - remember to cover body a little bit - standard for visiting that kind of places. Take a water because there are 272 steps just under the sun. A lot of people, not really clean place. Souvenirs expensive. Monkeys everywhere looking what to",
          "I visited Batu Caves with my mother. We went there by KRL Komuter. We do not go to the cave. Place is just OK, crowded, not really clean. Only spending a little time there to take photos at the stairs and with the stairs and statue on the background, and then we leave.",
          "Worship place, however turned into tourist place. Feels like being in India. Good to visit once. Careful with stairs",
          "We took the Batu caves tour with a stopover of two hours at this ancient limestone caves housing Hindu Gods and Goddesses. There are a lot of steps to climb upto the caves, all coloured which looks magnificent from afar. At the base is the golden statue of Lord Murugan,",
          "I started my journey early in the morning -and I went there by hiring a grab taxi. The taxi driver was excellent and he took only 30 minutes from the Bukit Bintang to visit there. I went there early in the morning because I had to visit the zoo Negara on the same day. The place",
          "It is very easy to access from KL Sentral station and tickets are cheap. Only 1 train goes there and it is the final destioantion. You can follow the crowd so you wont be lost. It is an amazing place to visit. Nature and human touch is inside each other. 272 steps and everywhere",
          "Pretty from afar with its bright and colorful stairs. It\u2019s about 200+ steps and quite steep. Be sure to wear proper shoes. Wear pants or you can rent the shawl for 5 ringit. Once inside the caves, there\u2019s not much to see. It can get very crowded, etc. If you have time,",
          "We had visited Batu Chavez first time 5 years ago and whichever caves they were with bats hanging all over we enjoyed. Today the cave has been converted into a Hindu temple with all kind of gods. It is a religious place and not much of nature.",
          "Located in the northern fringe of a mega-city of Kuala Lumpur, this cave has a distinct cultural and religious atmosphere, despite being heavily developed as a tourist attraction. The long and colourful steps can be a little challenging if you are not fit but the cave is worth",
          "I visited Batu Caves a long time ago before the steps were colorful, back then we did the dark caves tour which was interesting. This time we came just for the colorful steps :) Cover your knees, if not you can rent a sarung at the bottom of the stairs for RM5, they will",
          "Dedicated to Lord Muruga, Indian deity. The tallest idol downside the temple is the hightlight of the place. Bit far from the KL city, but close to airport. The temple is inside the cave. Can spend two hours, but need to climb 250 steps.",
          "Went as part of cruise ship excursion. We were given 45 minutes to get up the extremely steep but colourful steps and back to our guide, not helped by the intense heat. Views from the top very good but surprised to see more steps once inside. Plenty of monkeys inside but",
          "Amazing connection between nature and the birth of the Hindu religion. Be prepared for a mild climb to the summit were you will be greeted by peaceful monkeys running free and Hindu temples This attraction is free and expect to pay 40 ringgit from central KL each way by taxi or",
          "Batu Caves is worth visiting if you are looking for a quiet easy but exciting day out. The easiest way to the Caves is via train from KL Sentreal. They are quite regular. There are 272 steps to the top. They are wide steps with regular landings where you can take a break. Keep a",
          "Definitely one to go when in KL Wonderful morning experience we had, we were family of 5 and me and the children\u2019s loved our visit to the batu cave. We didn\u2019t bother going up the steps as it was a little to hot and didn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. We stayed at the bottom and have",
          "Well there isn\u2019t that much in the way of cultural offering in KL so we headed to the Batu Caves. A very impressive entrance with a giant statue and painted stairs. The climb up was hard work in the heat and humidity - the caves themselves were a bit underwhelming. The main cave",
          "Great place to visit. The Temples are big and the natural beauty of the caves beautiful!! On arrival you are hit by the colours of each structure. You need to be physically mobile as you climb nearly 300 steps to the top! The large cave is free to visit, the others you pay a",
          "Tour was lead by a fantastic and very knowledgeable guide. The Batu Caves are amazing. This is a must do tour if you are in Kuala Lumpur.",
          "Arrive early to see the place before most tourists arrive. I arrived early in the morning and had the chance to see the hinduists arriving for their prayers which was beautiful to see. The macaques only started showing up at around 11 am, with most of the other tourists. Do not",
          "This temple is located on the top of a mountain inside the lime stone cave called Batu caves. Accessible by train very close the station. You can take the train from KL Sentra which is around 30 mins away. As you enter the temple there is a Ramayana cave which has an entry",
          "The colourful Hindu temple was interesting and beautiful. The stairway up to the caves was definitely worth the effort. Up the top are lots of monkeys and many had babies attached. People could feed them however we didn't. They weren't phased by people around them. Our tour",
          "The most impressive are the caves and the surrounding nature. The rest is the set of a Boliwood movie. You spend an entertaining morning.",
          "The Caves are located right next to the Batu caves station. As soon as you reach at the entry point of the Caves you can see a massive golden statue of lord Murugan overlooking the city. Then comes the colorful staircases which leads you to the Caves. After taking almost 200+",
          "The place is good for pictures but if you don\u2019t follow the faith it won\u2019t be that enjoyable.

          "I liked the place. The cave at the top and temple inside the cave is awesome. Go early to avoid traffic and be aware one has to climb lots of stairs. Not a place for people with difficulties",
          "Batu caves have 272 colourful steps. Indian temple is located in the cave. Nice tourist place for photo shooting. You may just drive or day tour for a tourist.",
          "Very nice place.. not so many steps and its not too tiring. I will recommend you to visit this in the evening so the sun wont feel very hot un your skin and its better to take photos there at the evening",
          "We are from Bangalore, India. The Batu Caves were a great experience. For a few minutes, we forgot that we were in a foreign country. Clean temple and a divine feeling",
          "A great thing to visit on our KL holiday. It was very VERY busy and hot (@11am) so I'd probably go earlier in the morning if I went again.",
          "Batu Caves is the religious place for Hinduism, situated bit far from Kuala Lumpur. Take express train from the airport and then take direct local train for Batu cave stations, small hotels and Big C available but not much good entertainment in the area.",
          "Awesome place. One of the most famous Murugan Temples in the world. One should visit this place at least once in a life time. Filled with divinity and natural calmness.",

          "On the outskirts of the KL city is the massive statue of Lord Murugan and the soaring stepped climb to the caves. A place sprawling with monkeys, watch out for your personal belongings, especially food. Because the monkeys are deviously \u2026",
          "This is one of the wonderful places that I have experienced myself when going to Malaysia. We easily take some beautiful pictures at here and buy some souvenirs with reasonable prices. However, this place relatively fars from the center.",
          "The rainbow stairs was a charm. Worth to go in sunny day to catch the most of it. Enjoy. :) Easy to go there with Grab, both ways 20RM from Chinatown.",
          "Amazing Hindu Temple in the big caves. Must be in the good walking condition to claim almost 300 steps. Very majestic. Beware of hungry monkeys. One of the most beautiful Temple location I have seen.",
          "Love the mini zoo/art museum. Too many stairs though. Wet stairs near the top. Cave was also dripping, so be prepared to get slightly wet. The temples were cool too. The mini zoo is adorable, they have peacocks just walking around, and they have the tiniest rooster I've ever seen!",
          "Beautiful,easy to find (just use grab (local uber)), monkeys are kinda funny but watch out as they might wanna try to steal from you! Bring hat and water with you as you gotta climb 200+stairs and the place is covered by a lot of sunlight during daytime!",
          "Very nice.. total 289 steps . lots of monkeys.but not harmful.",
          "Good atmosphere, however there is lot of people visiting the caves. There are Hindi temples inside the caves and below the stairs so dress accordingly (you can buy scarfs for 5 RM). There are a lot of monkeys near the staira so be careful.",
          "Couldn't climb stairs due to disability but what an amazing place",
          "Again, it feels like you're in India, but must see the caves and beautiful temples, there are close to 300 steps to climb the hill, its worth the view from the top and the caves.\nDon't miss this place when you're in Kualampur.",
          "5 stars really, but deducted 1 for the amount of litter which was flabbergasting! Was worth the climb, and enjoyed watching the monkeys, just don't carry any food, they will steal it.",
          "A big tourist attraction in KL and a very sacred place of worship for devotees!  The 200+ steps leading up to the caves where the diety is worshipped in temples within is very colorful!  The huge gold colored Murugan statue before taking the steps is a wondrous to behold.",
          "So beautiful. I was so worry to let my mom climb all the stairs but it was okay. It was worth it. I love the place and also the religion temple there.",
          "If you are in Kualalampur then Batu cave is a must. It is a good hike up 100 something steps but totally doable. It is gorgeous and the vibe is amazing. This is a natural beauty. You will want to take a lot of photos. Wear a comfy shoes,the steps could be a little slippery but not too crazy. I am beyond ecstatic I finally made it.",
          "Batu Caves with the Temple of Lord Muruga. This is a very nice place to visit in Malaysia. You can get a taxi from anywhere in Kuala Lumpur to reach. You can use Public Transport also. KTM Komuter (Batu Cave) is the Nearest Station. You can \u2026",
          "Full of efforts to reach the caves, and you can see hindus praying at the temple inside the caves. The statue\u2019s so big, and I think it was the one of icon of KL, right (?) overall, its amazing.",
          "It's cool but... From 5 caves we managed to visit only two of them, on the top of the stairs. We came at 7AM, Thursday, to avoid crowd and heat and in that time two other caves are closed and one of them (accordingly the most interesting \u2026",
          "Great place. you'd find a lot of indian and srikankan tourists thronging this place.",
          "Amazing, do not forget to wear appropriate cloth. It is a temple not a beach. Bring your own mineral water, umbrella or hat in day time . It is very hot blazing hot!",
          "The experience is not very good when you travel from such clean city as KL. its smelly, dirty. the temples are clean though.. you get familiarity when you travel from India.. Our gods, our deities. try out the coconut water here. dont leave the coconut inside..",
          "Plz try to go to the top . It is very beautiful. At top of the cave there is a kovil. don't be afraid of monkeys.",
          "Its free, there are alot of wild animals! Becareful with your phone as monkeys might take them. If you cant walk stairs then its kinda pointless as there is no other way up than stairs",
          "Very nice veiw, can see the whole city from the top, the rainbow stairs are very colourful and there are monkeys everywhere heading up the steps. But the Cave is amazing, a big cavern with buildings inside.\nDefinitely recommend.",
          "A beautiful temple complex set inside a huge cave with wild monkeys. What other reason to go? Easy and cheap to get a Grab car there and back from central KL.",
          "A nice sightseeing to visit. It is a little bit wet and pretty crowded in the peak season. You also need to wear long skirts or jeans for being allowed to climb up the cave",
          "The colourful steps are a treat on the eyes tucked in at the Caves. Great spot to take photos with loved ones with such a beautiful background. Be aware of the monkeys! We watched two children have their unopened ice creams stolen from them and eaten by the monkeys. Save food and drinks for afterwards!",
          "This is where my first destination when I travel abroad. And for me this is the most memorable place I have ever been. One of the best tourist spot in Malaysia and you'll never regret to climb up that cave with the never ending stairs \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2026",
          "Very interesting to know about Hindu culture in Malaysia. The caves is very high to reach. And important thing to know is for girls and women are not allowed to get in with short pants or skirt.",
          "Beautiful place. Free. Easy to navigate/travel to via public transit.\n\nBe careful: monkeys run amuck and will take your belongings if given the chance.",

          "We went early in the morning. Saw the monks climb the stairs. It was still cool outside. I didn't see any monkeys. But I still enjoyed the visit",
          "Its a religius place but free access for tourist. Awesome view inside the cave, though it's a pretty tough way to reach it (hundreds stairs). Beware of the monkeys, they might snatch away your belongings. You might consider bringing an umbrella or a hat as a barrier from the sun heat.",
          "Its one of the most attractive tourist spots for the Indian people. The temple is located on the hill top. And its reachable easily from the metro train. And the temple is walk-able distance from the metro station. The first attraction is \u2026",
          "It is one of most popular temples in kuala lumpur, but you have to try to come a bit earlier as the weather there is getting very hot after 10 pm, it is easy to reach there. The place is just amazing from inside and outside.",
          "Nice place for photoshooting at the colorful staircase. An iconic landmark in KL. Is it worth visiting? Yes. Will I come again? No. IMO, It's once in a life time visit and should be in your bucket list.",
          "Batu Caves is one of the most attractive tourist destinations around KL. It is a sacred place for Hindu religion. Its vocal point is a huge yellow statue depicted one of Hindu's God and series of colored stairs that went uphill",

          "It would be nicer in the original way.",
          "276 steps according to my driver.  It's a workout but worth going all the way inside.  There are a couple shops at the bottom that have AC to help cool you of a little after the climb.  The number 1 attraction in KL, make sure you see it all.",

          "Unique experience for those who has never been. Stairs repainted to a bold rainbow coloured scheme. Very beautiful. Hope it maintains. Lots of monkeys but I went there at 7am. So no monkeys yet but a lot of pigeons.",
          "Incredible! There pics don't do it justice. You really have to see in person. And the monkeys are just entertaining",
          "Crowded with people, monkeys, and birds. It's good to bring your children to see around. The scenery is good and colorful. It also has conventional store sells gift etc",

          "amazing experience. I was happy to have been able to see this historic place. Sadly I didn't climb the steps because it was so blistering hot. Definitely go if you get the chance",
          "Nice place for photos of the colourful stairs. The walk up to the cave wasn't really worth it, you're not missing out on much if you can make it up",
          "Visited this place right after thaipusam. There were many stalls in the temple grounds at that point. The caves were really peaceful but cleanliness could be better maintained.",
          "Awesome.  Actually a little dusty but the beauty of this colorful place make u forget all of that. A very colorful and peaceful place that goes along with the nature.",
          "This was a beautiful area but extremely overcrowded. It's worth seeing though. Careful of pick pockets due to the crowding  and there is also lots of tour buses be mindful and stay alert.",
          "Even though it can be touristy, still definitely worth a visit. Cool natural cave with amazing vivid colors outside and inside.",
          "A mix of natural and artificial beauty. Some areas were not clean enough. Don't expect much. But as a major tourist spot in KL you should visit if your schedule is relaxing one.",
          "A little stinky but really admire the colourful stairs and bravo for those who painted them ....a little info for our lady tourists no short dresses r allowed...legs should be covered otherwise u will not be allowed to go upstairs \ud83d\ude42",
          "Really beautiful Hindu Temple . Would be nicer with an elevator but ok. It would be helpful if a thorough cleaning would be done. A pity how it is neglected . Avoid noon to afternoon . Really too hot",
          "You have to climb total of 272 steps if you wanna reach at the top of Batu Caves. So be ready! Just be careful and protect your belonging, because there would be a lot of monkeys waiting for you, especially food. Lol.",
          "Just a quick note on parking: be patient and make your way into the official parking lot - plenty of spaces and only RM2 per entry. If you park (illegally) outside on the side roads, people disguised as parking assistance will direct you to an open spot and ask for RM5 for their \"service\".",
          "I dono how many time I being to this temple.  Countless time.  But every time I enter the temple.  I feel the fresh feeling of being there for first time.  Such full good aura vibration temple. THAIPUSAM IS HIGH LIGHT OF THE TEMPLE AND MUST GO PRAYERS DAY. Love with....",
          "It's the main tourist attraction if visiting the area so we knew it was going to be busy. It was busy but didn't dampen the atmosphere at all. The place is absolutely stunning! It's difficult to take in from photos how beautiful the place \u2026",
          "Walk around 300 steps for the mesmerizing view of KL and the cave which is centuries old. There are temples inside the huge cave. Walking 300 steps is kinda hard, if you are not an athlete but its kinda fun. Take small steps and reach the summit.",
          "Incredible experience!! The stairs were a little brutal. Had to stop a few times, but so many people were doing it so I didn\u2019t feel so bad! :) \nBeautiful inside. A really nice place. Nothing else to do in the area. Just visit the cave. Can takes about 45 minutes from beginning of claiming to viewing inside then back down.",
          "Amazing place to visit, getting to know the variety of religious belief in a multicultural place like Malaysia is indeed enlightening. The place could use with bit of better garbage collection service. Quite a mess at certain place",
          "Well worth a visit. The Dark Cave was closed when I visited. Don't miss out on the temple at the foot of the steps, which most people don't seem to bother with.",
          "Wonderful place. Tough part is to climb the stairs, but manageable. Food, drinks can be available easy. Be aware of monkeys dont pass anything to eat.",
          "Quite crowded place but very fascinating. Full of monkeys that try to steal whatever you have in hands. Steep staircase to reach the top and enjoy a stunning view of the city.

          "interesting natural attractions. there are many stairs. beautiful flying birds. monkeys playing and hanging here and there.",
          "Quite an interesting place to visit. Conquer the colourful steps while teasing the local monkeys. They are quite tame but careful if you bring food as they will tail you. They seem to enjoy bananas and red apples. I saw people feeding them. Take note to remove your shoes if you are stepping into the temple and to wear long pants/skirt.",
          "The caves are lovely and the building and stairway had brilliant colours. A massive shame that a place that is meant to be sacred and I sight of worship has so much rubbish. And the dumpster on the at up to the stair case is abit misplaced",
          "Very hot and the stairs are steep as hell..a very good exercise for the the day. Wear comfortable shoes to go up the stairs!",
          "Beautiful place, where you can get up close with monkeys. Just remember that they are wild animals and may bite/carry disease. I just wish the dark caves were open, but I\u2019m sure they had good reasons for closing it (ie. To protect the wildlife)",
          "Its a cave.... It's noble cave because of idols and its position. Many worshipers of Hinduism come here to see and worship... It's much old. Many idols are there.  Monkeys will welcm you when you go up stairs to the highest and largest open cave of Malaysia.",

          "Most visited place when you're come to Malaysia. This temple have amazing place (because it's located in the cave), a wonderful design of temple with fantastic colours. The location not in the central KL, but there's many way to get here by \u2026",

          "First visit to Batu Caves, and it\u2019s free entrance. \n\nYou may park indoor, I don\u2019t think they charge during weekdays. You may try to take public transport(KTM) too, it\u2019s pretty convenient.",

          "Beautiful blend of Nature and Culture and colour altogether..... Good exercise with the stairs and great view and very very fresh breeze at the top..... Definitely going back!",
          "Don't go there. Nothing special, just a place everyone talks about on the internet for no reason.",

          "Very nice temple. Almost everyone visits here who comes to KL. Do visit caves if some one is interested in adventure. They are lime caves  which are formed in 1000 years. Lot of bats in caves. Lot of monkeys are in temple. Be aware. Must visit tourist point In KL.",
          "A great site for tourists to visit. I didn't get the chance to see the temple upstairs. But the colorful stairs and the big statue are really astonishing.",
          "temple is considered an important religious landmark by Hindus. Cathedral Cave \u2013 the largest and most popular cavern in Batu Caves \u2013 houses several Hindu shrines beneath its 100-metre-high arched ceiling. At the foot of Batu Hill are two \u2026",
          "We had a trip here from the cruise ship. We throughly enjoyed it didnt no if I would make it up all the steps but was actually not that bad and to see the temples inside the cave at the top and the views were great and the gold statue at the front was the icing on the cake. Loved it",
          "200+ steps for top. it is calm up there. caves are good. too old. not must, but should visit if you are first time in KL. view from upside is also good. too many monkeys, beware of them. don't tease, don't give food. stay away. dont panic at least.",

          "Tranquility at its best, the place never fails to lift your energy up. Murugan idol, stairs to climb, temple, food and the scenic view from the top - A COMPLETE PACKAGE. The monkeys were so friendly when we were feeding them. No doubt its one of the top 10 places to visit in KL.",
          "It's quite nice, but the dark cave next to the batu cave was closed, so we couldn't see. Lots of monkeys around (be careful with your belongings), not many things to do though.",
          "This place is really pretty, and is a very natural place. Plus, the climb is a lot easier than it looks. There are quite a few flaws, though. Nothing is organised. Everything is chaos. Also, the \"parking\" there is illegal, so remember to park somewhere outside.",
          "We got there at 6 am! Excessive? Sure. But we had the whole place to ourselves until a little bit after the sun came up. It was amazing!",
          "One of my favorite parts about my trip to KL. The caves holding the 3 temples were colorful and quite appealing to the eye. The trek up it is not bad but has some steep steps and lots of curious monkeys in your way. They will definitely steal your things if you hold them out so make sure to grip them.",
          "Visited back in February before the MCO, although I usually visit every time I'mm in KL. The Batu Caves are a series of caves with Hindu temples and shrines. The entrance to the caves is at the bottom of a hill where there\u2019s also the \u2026",

          "Great experience! No need for stroller as there are 200 stairs up to the Caves lol. Once up there you can buy drinks for 5 rmh and rest them proceed to explore. It is quite a unique experience so worth the visit!",

Climbing to the top of the cave is quite exhausting if you do it continuously more so if it is noon. On top, lots of chairs are scattered for you to rest.",
          "Nice place, suggest to go to the paid areas as well (close to the train station exit) much less crowded and really pretty. Overall a must on a KL visit, handy by train, though trains don\u2019t go that often so plan accordingly",
          "Nice. The steps lead to the cave were quite steep, need to be careful and cannot wear short pants or skirts. Many cute monkeys but they can steal your food \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",

          "Very humbling place to be fantastic colours there and if you make it all the way to the top of the steps which lead in to a impressive cave which holds a Hindu shrine. Loads of monkeys live there  which funny and cheeky characters,  where something loose as it's hot there but also remember that's a also a holy place.",
          "Great place, great history.  Achieved the unexpected during a hot day well worth the visit to climb up all those stairs. \n\nBe warned lots of monkeys, simply stop and allow them to pass you by they will leave you alone should you not have \u2026",
          "Finally ascended the steps of Batu Caves. A pretty easy climb despite being relatively unfit. The cave itself is truly impressive work of nature..made even more so by the Hindu temple. However its rather disgraceful that the surroundings \u2026",
          "Good place to visit. Can be decorated more and made convenient for elderly and disabled.",
          "I can't believe this isn't the most visited place in KL; monkeys, beautiful architecture, accessible by 30m train from Senteal, and FREE? It's an Instagram paradise. This could easily knock out a few hours of your day and makes for an easy trip if you have a long layover at KUL.",

          "Beautiful place. Women have to have legs and shoulders covered, although it is not generally advertised as such. You will have to rent a scarf for 5rm. Men could be naked for all they care. The monkeys seemed pretty friendly. Lots of steps to climb but it is worth it. Very busy though. Enjoy!",

          "It's nice. But they should've maintained the place well.",
          "Nice short trip of less than an hour for going up the stairs to the temple with free entrance. Do not feed the wild monkeys or you risk then snatching your belongings. On the side towards the train station, there is another gallery with peacocks roaming freely and many Indian deities statutes, which you pay for the entrance.",
          "it's really beautiful. there's monkeys,chickens and bats. inside was really beautiful of the cave's structure. the stairs look long but it doesn't take long to reach up there. going down was scary cause the stairs doesn't fit my whole feet. my legs are shaking! overall I like it. this is my first time going there!",
          "Can get super crowded with tourists from all over the world. But still good to see. They are trying to keep it clean and nice.",
          "A very enlightening experience that I would highly recommend visiting. I would suggest getting a tour so you could learn about the history and religious figures. My only negative is that there is a fair amount of garbage around the temples and caves which is a huge shame.",
          "I liked the stair, they were colorful",
          "One of the landmark when you visit Kuala Lumpur. Must visit place to complete your KL adventure! The place is a holy site for Hindu people. It would be nice if they have strict parking regulations so no car parking by side the road.",

I would recommend to go there early in the morning (before 10am during the weekdays or early in weekend) or late in the afternoon (for the sunset) to avoid the huge groups of tourists. The Hindu temple left of the stairs is wonderful, don't forget to spend some time visiting it!",
          "It is naturally serene, finally some animals found.. birds found in Malaysia.. there are lot of pigeons and monkeys.. also some dogs. The souvenir market is also reasonable. The temples are breathtaking. And the view from up caves is amazing.",
          "If you're visiting KL, this place is a must visit. It's a Hindu temple of Lord Murugan on the foothills. It's been 2 years that they have renovated the temple and it's surroundings to a beautiful tourists attraction. On the outside you see \u2026",
          "One of the most beautiful attraction in KL. This place is quite crowded by tourist. There actually not much to see inside the caves. Kindly keep a note of your attire as they dont allow you to enter with shorts.",

          "Attended a wedding at the Ganesha temple at the foot of Batu Caves. The devotional attraction was so great that instead of going for the function, I found myself walking up the steps. Batu Caves is a tourist attraction and being a Sunday it \u2026",

          "Such a nice place, i really like the Pease fully environment, and beautiful natural scenery",
          "Perhaps the thing u should see if u could only visit one place. The monkeys are very entertaining and thieving. Going up and down one stole a plastic bag with a yellow scarf (bananas?) And another a nearly full smoothie. Be careful. There is no dress code, regardless of what u may be told by others.",
          "We visited the Batu Caves in August. Definitely would recommend it if you are staying in or near KL and if you are in decent physical shape! You really want to climb the 271 steps to get to the top. Walk through the open caves and see the \u2026",

          "Nice to see but nothing special. The monkeys are nice to see. A lot of tourist though. Come early!",
          "Nice main cave (Temple cave) and Murugan statue although it looks a bit like Disneyland outside and inside. Still worth a visit if you are in KL. Free entrance to the stairs and main cave but donations appreciated of course. Closes at \u2026",

The experience of walking up the stairs is really nice and the views on KL are great.\n\nMy favourite part though? The monkeys! Crazy, crazy Makaks!",
          "One of the beautiful and thrilling caves formed naturally. When you are there in middle of the caves you get thrilled and sometimes get scared as well as stones naturally carved like sharp knives. These may tare you into two peice from top \u2026",

          "Nice view. The colourful temple and steps are amazing",
          "I climbed the stairs with my 7 year & 4 year old sons. It was good enough for little exercise and lots of fun. For the monkeys at this place, we brought some banana. When the monkeys see plastic bag in someone's hand, they rush and take it. So be careful. It took about 40 minutes to look around this spot. No fee is required.",
          "Must see if you come to KL, not that difficult to climb the stairs if you take some breaks. The statue at the front and the coloured steps are very photogenic. The best part is the temple situated within the cave. It's definitely unique.",
          "It is famous when you reach to KL. There are alot of nature monkeys, doves, chickens... \nYou will visit and see the high golden statue of Indian God. The colorfull steps and walls make you lost in the Indian Fairytale story about the Gods. \u2026",

          "Wow! This was a must see for an afternoon flight layover in KL. Breathtaking Hindu temples, rainbow colored and set in caves. 272 steps up is worth it to see the to views! Few monkeys around, be careful. Not great toilets either, and a few \u2026",

          "Wear lots of bug spray!!! There are lots of bugs inside and outside the cave. \n\nI arrived around 10-10:30am and there are lots of tourists. However, there is a long stairway to the top which keeps the top of the cave fairly empty since it \u2026",
          "Batu Cave\u2019s is one of the places not to be missed when going to Malaysia, you can go by bus or train to get there.  You will go up the stairs, meet the monkeys before going inside the cave.",

          "Came here twice but didn't get to see the cave because the tour schedule is pretty tight on time. But seeing the big golden statue and the colorful stairs is interesting enough. You can come here easily using KMT to Batu Caves station",
          "The cave is worth seeing. It has some colorful decorations. Lots of space inside the cave. However  walking up that 272 steps can be frustrating in the heat. Steps are quite narrow so be careful while  walking down.  Keep  your water bottle \u2026",

          "Overall ok... but just good for the quick snap, no need to walk all the way up because nothing to be exciting about inside. \n1. No need for entrance fee\n2. The temperature is very hot and humid in cave\n3. Best way to get around is with Grab \u2026",
          "It is a tourist destination spot in Malaysia for devoted Hindu's. What surprised me was the infrastructure around this place was very inadequate. Souvenir shops and restaurants should raise their shop standards.",

        "wiki": "Merdeka Square (Malay: Dataran Merdeka) is a square located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is situated in front of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building.  Literally Independence Square, it was formerly known as the Selangor Club Padang or simply the \"Padang\" (meaning \"field\" in Malay) and was used as the cricket green of the Selangor Club (now the Royal Selangor Club). It was here the Union Flag was lowered and the Malaysian flag hoisted for the first time at midnight (time: 12:00 AM) on 31 August 1957. Since then, Merdeka Square has been the usual venue for the annual Merdeka Parade (National Day Parade).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early days of Kuala Lumpur, the Chinese and Malay communities settled along the east bank of the Klang River. To the west of the river was land originally owned by Yap Ah Loy and was used to plant vegetables. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration. The then British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas decided that the government buildings and staff living quarters should be located to the west of the river to keep away from what he considered the unsanitary condition of the town and the possibility of uprising from the locals. The government offices and a new police headquarter were built on Bukit Aman, with accommodation for the police located on Barrack Road (now Jalan Tangsi and part of Jalan Raja).  A patch of swampy and uneven ground immediately to the west of Klang River was then levelled and drained to be used as a training ground for the police.  The land was acquired from Yap by the British Resident Frank Swettenham for $50 per acre in 1882. This patch of land, originally named the Parade Ground, would become the Padang. Ten years later in 1892, the Acting British Resident Ernest Birch who was a keen cricketer then started to smooth over the ground so that it may be used as a cricket ground and other sports. The Selangor Club clubhouse was built at the present location in 1890 and the St Mary's Church was built in 1895.\nIn 1897, the government offices were relocated from Bukit Aman to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building overlooking the Padang.  The building is one of the most significant landmarks built by the British and was designed by A.C. Norman, R. A. J. Bidwell, and A. B. Hubback in an Indo-Saracenic or Neo-Mughal style of architecture.  This building housed the Selangor State Secretariat and later the Supreme Court before the court was moved, and the building was left unused for a few years. It now houses the Ministry of Heritage, Culture and Arts.As the Sultan Abdul Samad Building was designed and its construction began before Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the Federated Malay States, it became it inadequate for the use of a burgeoning bureaucracy when it was made the capital. Many buildings were then constructed near it around the Padang. A printing office was constructed in 1899 on the southwest corner of the Padang, the town hall to the northeast in 1904, the FMS Railway offices to the southeast in 1905, the General Post Office south of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1907, the Survey Department building in 1910 and the Supreme Court in 1915 in the northeast area.As the Padang is located in front of the government offices, it is used for many national and civic events.  The Padang was once leased to the Selangor Club which used it for various sports such as cricket and rugby.  In 1987, the Padang was taken back by City Hall and in return, the Selangor Club was given a piece of land in Bukit Kiara.On the midnight of 30 August 1957, the British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang, an event watched by a large number of people there. In the morning of 31 August 1957, the ceremony for Malayan independence was then held at the Merdeka Stadium.\nThe Padang was renamed 'Dataran Merdeka' or Merdeka Square in October 1989. It was done in conjunction with the Visit Malaysia Year 1990 campaign beginning 1 January 1990.\nOn 31 August 2007, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi shouted 'Merdeka!' on midnight celebrations, where thousands of Malaysians celebrated 50 years of nationhood.\n\n\n== Notable buildings and features ==\n\nA 95-metre flagpole, one of the tallest in the world, is located at the southern end of the square.  A flat, round black marble plaque marks the location where the Malayan flag was raised for the first time. Near the flagpole at the corner of the Padang is a fountain, the Cop's Fountain, built in 1897 as a memorial to Steve Harper, a popular police inspector.  A car park and retail area, the Plaza Putra which was later renamed Plaza Dataran Merdeka, was built beneath the Merdeka Square; however, the location had been affected by flooding.Surrounding the square are many buildings of historical interest. Just beside the square is the Sultan Abdul Samad Building currently the office of the Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture of Malaysia. Opposite the square is the Royal Selangor Club which was first founded in 1884 as a meeting place for high-ranking members of the British colonial society. To the South is the former National History Museum which used to house a vast collection of historical items. The collection has recently been moved to Muzium Negara. Next to it is the Kuala Lumpur City Gallery which tells the story of Kuala Lumpur through miniature models and The Spectacular City Model Show. To the North is the St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral, currently the Diocese of West Malaysia and the see of the Bishop of West Malaysia.  Not far from the square is also the original Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, which is still operational. However, the main hub has recently been moved to KL Sentral in 2001.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nMerdeka Square is the usual venue for the annual Merdeka Parade (National Day Parade).  It is frequently used as the location for political rallies as well as other events. Merdeka Square was the starting line of The Amazing Race Asia 1.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe square is accessible within walking distance west of Masjid Jamek LRT Station.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMerdeka Square, Jakarta\nOccupy Dataran\nPutra Square\n\n\n== References ==",

As the global city of Malaysia, it covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016. Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the Klang Valley, is an urban agglomeration of 7.25 million people as of 2017. It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.\nKuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Malaysian King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong), the Istana Negara. The city once held the headquarters of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government, but these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999. However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three federal territories of Malaysia, enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Towers, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysian development.\nKuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, such as mass rapid transit (MRT), light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, public buses, hop on & hop off buses (free of charge) and airport rail links. Kuala Lumpur is one of the leading cities in the world for tourism and shopping, being the 10th most-visited city in the world in 2017. The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.Kuala Lumpur has been ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking at No. 70 in the world, and No. 2 in Southeast Asia after Singapore.  Kuala Lumpur was named as one of the New7Wonders Cities, and has been named as World Book Capital 2020 by UNESCO.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nKuala Lumpur means \"muddy confluence\" in Malay; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means \"mud\". One suggestion is that it was named after Sungai Lumpur (\"muddy river\"); it was recorded in the 1820s that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River. Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak as the point where one river joins a larger one or the sea is its kuala. It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur in fact extended down to the confluence (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), although Sungai Lumpur is said to be another river joining the Klang River a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence, or perhaps located to the north of the Batu Caves area.It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (\"muddy landing place\") in the same way that Klang was once called Pengkalan Batu (\"stone landing place\"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur. Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIt is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang (Klang River) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut, raised funds from Malaccan Chinese businessmen to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines.\n\nAlthough the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from these mines was exported in 1859. At that time Sutan Puasa was already trading near Ampang, two traders from Lukut, Hiu Siew and Yap Ah Sze, then arrived in Kuala Lumpur where they set up shops to sell provisions to miners in exchange for tin. The town, spurred on by tin-mining, started to develop centred on Old Market Square (Medan Pasar), with roads radiating out towards Ampang as well as Pudu and Batu (the destinations became the names of these roads) where miners also started to settled in, and Petaling and Damansara. The miners formed gangs among themselves; and fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, particularly between factions of Kuala Lumpur and Kanching, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew the early Chinese trader was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, was appointed in 1868.Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include Haji Mohamed Tahir who became the Dato Dagang (\"chief of traders\"). The Minangkabaus from Sumatra became another important group of peoples who traded and established tobacco plantations in the area. Notable Minangkabaus include their headman Dato' Sati, Utsman Abdullah, and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru. The Minangkabaus were also significant socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.\n\n\n=== Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur ===\n\nEarly Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems \u2013 the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang. The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy. Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban centre.\n\nThe early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River \u2013 the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarters was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897.Frank Swettenham, on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated in 1884 that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the \"five-foot ways\" as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court. With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest.\n\nA railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.\n\n\n=== 20th century\u2013present ===\n\nThe area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2, and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory.The development of rubber industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based elsewhere also found a presence here.\n\nDuring World War II, Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage during the course of the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishir\u014d Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.The first municipal election in Kuala Lumpur was held on 16 February 1952. An ad hoc alliance between the Malay UMNO and Chinese MCA party candidates won a majority of the seats contested, and their success led to the formation of the Alliance Party (later the Barisan Nasional). On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. The British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang on the midnight of 30 August 1957, and in the morning of 31 August, the ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963.\n\nKuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.\nKuala Lumpur achieved city status on 1 February 1972, becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function, and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, major urban developments in the Klang Valley have resulted in an extended Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. This area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur, extends from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur westward to Port Klang, east to the edge of the Titiwangsa Mountains as well as to the north and south. The area covers other administratively separate towns and cities such as Klang, Shah Alam, Putrajaya and others, and it is served by the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. Notable projects undertaken within Kuala Lumpur itself include the development of a new Kuala Lumpur City Centre around Jalan Ampang and the Petronas Towers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley. The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to \"muddy confluence\" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers.\n\nLocated in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was a territory of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location within the most developed state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi), with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft).\n\n\n=== Climate and weather ===\nProtected by the Titiwangsa Range in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur is safe from strong winds and has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 35 \u00b0C (90 and 95 \u00b0F) and sometimes hit 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 \u00b0C (74.1 and 76.3 \u00b0F) and have never fallen below 17.8 \u00b0C (64.0 \u00b0F). Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month.\nFlood is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur after heavy downpours, especially in the city centre, because the structural irrigation lags behind the intensive development within the city. Smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nKuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who has been in office since 18 July 2015.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia. It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur's eleven districts, with estimated population and percentage of the total, serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall authority.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nKuala Lumpur is home to the Parliament of Malaysia. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, has stipulated the three branches, of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branches. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya, certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia (National Bank of Malaysia), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city.The city remains as the economic and business hub in the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city, and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang, the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.\nBursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. By 2015, the GDP has reached RM160,388 million, representing 15.1% of the total GDP of Malaysia. The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 was RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent, and RM94,722 in 2015. Average monthly household income is RM9,073 (~$2,200) as of 2016, growing at a pace of approximately 6% a year. The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the country's largest companies have their headquarters here, and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas, there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur.Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists.\nThere has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions\u2014 has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000 sq m-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.\n\nThe major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the PETRONAS Twin Towers, the Bukit Bintang shopping district, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, Petaling Street (Chinatown), the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the National Palace (Istana Negara), the National Museum, Islamic Arts Museum, Central Market, KL Bird Park, Aquaria KLCC, the National Monument, and religious sites such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Jamek Mosque, Thean Hou Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfield. Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor.The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing  Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. Trendy nightclubs, bars and lounges, such as Marini's on 57, Skybar at Traders Hotel, the Beach Club, Espanda, the Hakka Republic Wine Bar & Restaurant, Hard Rock Cafe, the Luna Bar, Nuovo, Rum Jungle, No Black Tie, the Thai Club, Zion club, Zouk, and many others are located here.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nKuala Lumpur alone has 66 shopping malls and is the retail and fashion hub in Malaysia as well as Southeast Asia. Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (US$2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006.\n\nSuria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier upscale shopping destination due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers.\nApart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungei Wang Plaza and Quill City Mall. Changkat area of Bukit Bintang hosts various cafes, alfresco dining outlets and illegal activities. Bangsar district also has a few shopping complexes, including Bangsar Village, Bangsar Shopping Centre, and Mid Valley Megamall.\nApart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles, fabrics and handicrafts. The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street, is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences.Since 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event at the time is held three times a year \u2013 in March, May and December \u2013 during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia which being maintained until present with new mega sales.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.76 million in the city proper as of 2016. It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites. Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley metropolitan (covering Petaling Jaya, Klang, Subang Jaya, Puchong, Shah Alam, Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.25 million as of 2017.Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians, as well as Kadazans, Ibans and other indigenous races from around Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Historical demographics ===\n\nHistorically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a \"purely Chinese village\", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war). The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2\u2013300, many of whom then brought their families here. Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka \u5ba2\u5bb6\u4eba), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another perhaps more accurate estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. The rubber boom in the early 20th century lead to a further increase in population, from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into Malaysia, many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits.Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people \u2013 the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. On the other hand, the working age group of 15\u201359 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays, the Indian Muslim communities and a small number of Chinese Muslims. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity.As of 2010 Census, the population of Kuala Lumpur was 46.4% Muslim, 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu, 5.8% Christian, 1.4% of unknown affiliations, 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 0.6% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three states where less than 50% of the population are self-identified Muslims, the other two being Penang and Sarawak.\nStatistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 87.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (7.9%), Chinese folk religions (2.7%) and Muslims (0.6%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (81.1%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Christians (7.8%), Muslims (4.9%) and Buddhists (2.1%). The non-Malay bumiputera community are predominantly Christians (44.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (31.2%) and Buddhists (13.5%). All bumiputera Malays are Muslim; this is due to the criterion in the definition of a Malay in the Malaysian constitution that they should adhere to Islam.Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. Malaysian English is a variant widely used. It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken by minorities include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi, and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles \u2013 Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.\nIndependence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Telekom Tower, Maybank Tower, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world and the tallest buildings in the country. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe Lake Gardens, a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Parliament building is located close by, and Carcosa Seri Negara which was once the official residence of British colonial administration is also sited here. The park includes a Butterfly Park, Deer Park, Orchid Garden, Hibiscus Garden and the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, which is the world's largest aviary bird park. Other parks in the city include the ASEAN Sculpture Garden, KLCC Park, Titiwangsa Lake Gardens, Metropolitan Lake Gardens in Kepong, Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, Taman Tasik Permaisuri (Queen's Lake Gardens), Bukit Kiara Botanical Gardens, Equestrian Park and West Valley Park near TTDI, and Bukit Jalil International Park.\nThere are three forest reserves within the city namely the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve in the city centre, the oldest gazetted forest reserve in the country 10.52 ha or 26.0 acres, Bukit Sungai Putih Forest Reserve (7.41 ha or 18.3 acres) and Bukit Sungai Besi Forest Reserve (42.11 ha or 104.1 acres). Bukit Nanas, in the heart of the city centre, is one of the oldest virgin forests in the world within a city. These residual forest areas are home to a number of fauna species particularly monkeys, treeshrews, pygmy goats, budgerigars, squirrels and birds.\nThere is another park in the close vicinity to Kuala Lumpur i.e. Templer Park initiated and opened by Sir Gerald Templer in 1954 during the \"Emergency\" time.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAccording to government statistics, Kuala Lumpur has a literacy rate of 97.5% in 2000, the highest rate in any state or territory in Malaysia.\nIn Malaysia, Malay is the language of instruction for most subjects while English is a compulsory subject, but as of 2012, English is still the language of instruction for mathematics and the natural sciences for certain schools. Some schools provide Mandarin and Tamil as languages of instruction for certain subjects. Each level of education demands different skills of teaching and learning ability.Kuala Lumpur contains 13 tertiary education institutions, 79 high schools, 155 elementary schools and 136 kindergartens.Several institutions in the city are older than 100 years\u2014such as Bukit Bintang Girls' School (1893\u20132000, relocated to Taman Shamelin Perkasa in Cheras and renamed GIS Garden International school Seri Bintang Utara), the Victoria Institution (1893); Methodist Girls' School (1896); Methodist Boys' School (1897); Convent Bukit Nanas (1899), St. John's Institution (1904), Confucian Private Secondary School (1906), Kuen Cheng High School (1908), Tsun Jin High School (1913) and Maxwell School (1917).\n\nKuala Lumpur is home to the University of Malaya (UM). Established in 1949, it is the oldest university in Malaysia, and one of the oldest in the region. It was ranked the best university in Malaysia, the 22nd best in Asia, and 3rd in Southeast Asia in QS World University Rankings 2019. In recent years, the number of international students at University of Malaya has risen, as a result of increasing efforts made to attract more international students.Other universities located in Kuala Lumpur include Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TARUC), UCSI University (UCSI), Taylor's University (TULC), International Medical University (IMU), Open University Malaysia (OUM), Kuala Lumpur University (UniKL), Wawasan Open University (WOU), HELP University and the branch campus of the National University of Malaysia (UKM) and University of Technology Malaysia (UTM). The National Defence University of Malaysia is located at Sungai Besi Army Base, at the southern part of central Kuala Lumpur. It was established to be a major centre for military and defence technology studies. This institution covers studies in the field of army, navy, and air force.Greater Kuala Lumpur covers an even more extensive selection of universities including several international branches such as Monash University Malaysia Campus, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus and Xiamen University Malaysia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is a hub for cultural activities and events in Malaysia. Among the centres is the National Museum, which is situated along the Mahameru Highway. Its collection comprises artefacts and paintings collected throughout the country. The Islamic Arts Museum, which houses more than seven thousand Islamic artefacts including rare exhibits as well as a library of Islamic art books, is the largest Islamic Arts collection in Southeast Asia. The museum's collection not only concentrate on works from the Middle East, but also includes work from elsewhere in Asia, such as China and Southeast Asia. Kuala Lumpur has a Craft Complex coupled with a museum that displays a variety of textile, ceramic, metal craft and weaved products. All the information of the production process are portrayed in diorama format complete with historical facts, technique and traditionally engineered equipment. Among the processes shown are pottery making, intricate wood carving, silver-smithing, weaving songket cloth, stamping batik patterns on cloth and boat making. Royal Selangor has an ultra modern visitor's centre, which allows tours to be conducted through its pewter museum, gallery and its factory. In its pewtersmithing workshop, \"The School of Hard Knocks\", participants are taught to create their own pewter dish using traditional tools and methods.\nThe premier performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall located underneath the Petronas Towers. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO), consisting of musicians from all over the world and features regular concerts, chamber concerts and traditional cultural performances. The Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPac) in Sentul West and Damansara Performing Arts Centre (DPac) in Damansara Perdana are two of the most established centres for performing arts, notably theatre, plays, music, and film screening in the country. It has housed many local productions and has been a supporter of local and regional independent performance artists. The Future Music Festival Asia are being held in the city since 2012 featuring local and international artists.The National Art Gallery of Malaysia is located on Jalan Temerloh, off Jalan Tun Razak on a 5.67-hectare (14.0-acre) site neighbouring the National Theatre (Istana Budaya) and National Library. The architecture of the gallery incorporates elements of traditional Malay architecture, as well as contemporary modern architecture. The National Art Gallery serves as a centre of excellence and trustee of the national art heritage. The Petronas Art Gallery, another centre for fine art, is situated in Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC). The Ilham Tower Gallery near Ampang Park houses exhibitions of works by local and foreign artists.\nKuala Lumpur holds the Malaysia International Gourmet Festival annually. Another event hosted annually by the city is the Kuala Lumpur Fashion Week, which includes international brands as well as local designers.\nKuala Lumpur also is becoming the centre for new media, innovation and creative industry development in the region and hosts the international creative industry event, Kreative.Asia.\nKreative.Asia gathers local, regional and international experts in the creative industry who are involved in the creation, development and delivery of interactive content, arts, community and applications. Kuala Lumpur is at the forefront of the convergence of media, art, culture and communications.\n\n\n=== Sports and recreation ===\nKuala Lumpur has numerous parks, gardens and open spaces for recreational purposes. Total open space for recreational and sport facilities land use in the city has increased significantly by 169.6 percent from 5.86 square kilometres (1,450 acres) in 1984 to 15.8 square kilometres (3,900 acres) in 2000.Kuala Lumpur was touted as one of the host cities for the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017. The open-wheel auto racing A1 Grand Prix was held until the series folded in 2009. The Motorcycle Grand Prix races are held at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang in the neighbouring state of Selangor.

Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.\n\nIn terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of city. The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres, an airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eight minutes and costs RM 55 (roughly US$13.50), while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal but from KLIA2 which is two kilometres from KLIA. KLIA2 is served by an extension of the KLIA Ekspres and by a free shuttle bus service from KLIA. As of 2018, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as Firefly and Malindo Air.Public transport in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the expansion of the rail network. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, mass rapid transit (MRT) and airport rail link. The LRT system has three lines, Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line and Sri Petaling Line, connecting many locations within the city and surrounding suburbs. The KL Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter and MRT connect the city centre with other suburbs and cities of the Klang Valley. The main railway hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the most of the rail lines. KL Sentral is also a hub for the intercity railway service KTM ETS, which travels from north to south Peninsular Malaysia through the city centre. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more railway lines due for completion or in the pipeline, such as the Putrajaya Line and Bandar Utama-Klang Line.\nThe largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus, using Rapid KL brand name. Since the take over from Intrakota Komposit Sdn Bhd, Prasarana Malaysia has redrawn the entire bus network of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley metropolitan area to increase passenger numbers and improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The Prasarana Malaysia has adopted the hub and spoke system to provide greater connectivity, and cut down the need of more buses.In Kuala Lumpur, most taxis have distinctive white and red liveries. Kuala Lumpur is one of the major ASEAN city with taxis extensively running on natural gas. Taxis can be hailed from taxi stands or from the streets.

The port is the largest and busiest in the country handling about 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargo in 2006.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nKuala Lumpur is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Kuala Lumpur\nPutrajaya\nCyberjaya\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGullick, J.M.

        "wiki": "The Sultan Abdul Samad Building (Malay: Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad; Jawi: \u0628\u0627\u06a0\u0648\u0646\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0645\u062f) is a late-nineteenth century building located along Jalan Raja in front of the Dataran Merdeka (Independence Square) and the Royal Selangor Club in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The building originally housed the offices of the British colonial administration, and was known simply as Government Offices in its early years. In 1974 it was renamed after Sultan Abdul Samad, the reigning sultan of Selangor at the time when construction began 20\nThe building houses both the offices of the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture of Malaysia (Malay: Kementerian Komunikasi dan Multimedia, Kementerian Pelancongan dan Kebudayaan Malaysia). It once housed the superior courts of the country: the Federal Court of Malaysia, the Court of Appeals and the High Court of Malaya. The Federal Court and the Court of Appeals had shifted to the Palace of Justice in Putrajaya during the early 2000s, while the High Court of Malaya shifted to the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex in 2007.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin and design ===\nThe government offices of the British colonial administration was originally located in the Bluff Road (present day Jalan Bukit Aman) area on a hill overlooking the Padang now called Merdeka Square. However, due to the need for more office space and complaints from the public about the necessity of going up and down the hill, the State Engineer of Selangor Public Works Department Charles Edwin Spooner proposed the building of government offices lower down at the plain. The initial suggestion was rejected due to cost, but the British Resident of Selangor William Edward Maxwell accepted a second proposal that cost less.The building was originally designed by A.C. Norman and his assistant R. A. J. Bidwell in a Classical Renaissance style, but Spooner disliked the design. It was then reworked by Bidwell under Spooner's guidance in a style variously described as Indo-Saracenic, Neo-Mughal, or Moorish. Later A. B. Hubback who had just starting working for the colonial government in Malaya as a senior draughtsman also worked on it. Although the building is formally credited to A.C. Norman (only his name appears on the foundation stone as the architect) and his ground plan was kept, the actual design is to a large extent the work of R. A. J. Bidwell, with some contributions from A. B. Hubback who also designed the fixtures of the building.\n\nThe building has two stories, with the floor plan roughly in the shape of the letter F with an extended top bar representing the frontage. The facade of the building faces the Padang and stretches over 137.2 metres (450 ft) along Jalan Raja, at that time the largest building in Malaya. The building has 3.5 metres (11 ft) wide verandas on both floors. A central clock tower is 41 metres (135 ft) in height, and designed to echo the Big Ben but in an Indo-Saracenic style. Two lower towers flanked the clock tower, each containing a staircase. The design of these two towers may have been influenced by Muir Central College of Allahabad in India. All three towers are topped by a copper-clad onion dome. The style of the building is sometimes referred to as the \"blood and bandages\" style\u2014red bricks with white plastered arches and banding.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe construction of the building began in September 1894 and was completed in 1897. The foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1894 by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Charles Mitchell. The building sits on an area of 1.034 hectares, with the floor of the building occupying an area of 4,208.5 square metres (45,300 sq ft). The construction used 4 million bricks, 2,500 barrels of cement, 18,000 pikuls of lime, 5,000 lbs of copper, 50 tons of steel and iron, and about 30,000 cubic feet of timber. Spooner had previously established in the Brickfields area a factory for the production of large number of higher quality bricks, tiles and other building material suitable for the construction of the building. The cost of construction was 152,000 straits dollars.Spooner also made many alterations and additions while the building was being constructed with the help of A. B. Hubback. Some of these, such as an extra two and a half feet of brickwork on the lower walls, were necessary to strengthen the building due to it being built so close to the river. The height of the clock tower had also caused much concern to the public, who thought that the tower may collapse due to the ground vibrations caused by a loud signal gun fired daily at noon and 5 pm, the built tower however proved to be sturdy. A problem arose with the clock first delivered as it was not in harmony with the building, and it was replaced by a second one. The clock was manufactured by Gillett & Johnston Ltd of Croydon.\n\n\n=== Opening ===\nThe building was completed in 1897, and a dinner was held by the Selangor Public Works Department in the building to celebrate its completion. On 4 April 1897, The building was officially opened by Sir Frank Swettenham, the General Resident of the time. A ball was held at the building, and its exterior was floodlit by gas burners, the first time such illumination was used in Kuala Lumpur.The 41-metre (135 ft) tower chimed for the first time to coincide with Queen Victoria\u2019s Jubilee Parade in June 1897 and has chimed since.\n\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe completed structure housed various important government departments during the British administration. The building, simply known as Government Offices in early Kuala Lumpur maps, housed the Federal Secretariat of the then-Federated Malay States (FMS) which was formed in 1896. The entire FMS administration\u2014the Public Works Department, General Post Office, District Offices, Mines Department, Lands, Audit, Treasury, Government Secretariat Offices\u2014was housed there. It also shared its offices with the Selangor State Government.\nAs it was not foreseen when construction began in 1894 that Kuala Lumpur would become the capital of the Federated Malay States, the office space provided was inadequate for the need of a burgeoning bureaucracy. The FMS government took over the offices that were intended for the Sanitation Board. Other buildings and extensions were then constructed around it. A rear wing was added in 1903, and a building built in the same style was added to the south in 1907 to house the General Post Office.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\n\nMalaya gained independence in 1957, and the Padang or field in front of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, officially renamed Dataran Merdeka (or Merdeka Square) on 1 January 1990, has become the location for the official celebration of Malayan (later Malaysian) independence since. At Dataran Merdeka, the British Union Jack was lowered for the last time at midnight on 30 August 1957 when the clock started chiming, and the Malayan flag then hoisted for the first time. Celebrations shifted to the Merdeka Stadium in the morning on 31 August with the Declaration of Independence, and Tunku Abdul Rahman became the first prime minister of Malaya.In 1974, all of the State of Selangor Government offices were relocated to Shah Alam, and the various departments of the Federal Government also moved their offices elsewhere. The building was then renamed Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad (Sultan Abdul Samad Building) and renovated.Starting from 1978, the building housed the Court of Appeal, High Court and the Supreme Court, which was subsequently renamed the Federal Court. The Federal Court and the Court of Appeals have since moved to the Palace of Justice located in Putrajaya, the new Federal administrative capital. The building now houses the offices of the Ministry of Information, Communications and Culture of Malaysia and underwent further refurbishment.Every year, in the morning of Merdeka Day (31 August) as well as Malaysia Day (16 September), thousands of spectators converge on the city to watch the colourful parade along the streets of the city and performances held at the Merdeka Square.\nIn 2012, the building was partly refurbished and the copper domes received a new coating of metallic paint. New colour-changing LED lights were installed to brighten up the building at night. On selected days, a section of Jalan Raja will be closed in order for the people to enjoy the night scenery of the area. Since 2007, a Merdeka (Independence) wording has been fixed at the bottom of the clock tower, a reminder of the very day of the nation's independence in 1957.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nTopped by a shiny copper dome and a 41m high clock tower, it is a major landmark in the city. The clock tower houses a one-ton bell clock that strikes on the hour and half-hour.\nA 95-metre flagpole, one of the tallest in the world, marks that spot with a flat, round black marble plaque. It is located at the southern end of the Merdeka Square in front of the building.\nThe building serves as the backdrop for important events such as the National Day Parade on 31 August and the ushering in of the New Year. Each of the 13 states plus the Federal Territories are represented in the National Day Parade, as are the many ethnic groups that comprise multiracial Malaysia.\nBehind the building flows the Klang River and Gombak River's confluence and in the middle of where the two rivers meet stands the Masjid Jamek (or Jamek Mosque), a mosque designed in similar architectural style.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn 1971, Kuala Lumpur suffered a huge flood after a heavy rainfall. Part of the building was not spared. In 1978, a massive renovation was undertaken. The renovation took six years to complete with a total cost of RM 17.2 million. There was also a fire which damaged part of the building. A large bronze memorial plaque commemorating fallen judicial officers and lawyers who served as volunteer soldiers in the Second World War disappeared about this time. The plaque was either looted or else was damaged in the fire but was never repaired or replaced.

It is located on 1.67 acres (6,758 m2) of land atop Robson Heights on Lorong Bellamy, overlooking Jalan Syed Putra. It was completed in 1987 and officially opened in 1989. The temple was built by Hainanese living in Malaysia and the property belongs to and is run by the Selangor and Federal Territory Hainan Association (Malay: Hainan Selangor and Wilayah Persekutuan; Chinese: \u96ea\u9686\u6d77\u5357\u4f1a\u9986/\u96ea\u9686\u6d77\u5357\u6703\u9928). It is one of the largest temples in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Thean Hou Temple was constructed from 1981 and completed in 1987 at a cost of approximately RM7 million.The installation dates of the Goddesses are as follows:\n\n16 November 1985 \u2014 Tian Hou\n19 October 1986 \u2014 Guan Yin\n16 November 1986 \u2014 Shui Wei Sheng NiangThe temple was officially opened on 3 September 1989.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Architectural ===\nThis syncretic temple with elements of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism is a grandiose structure and represents a successful combination of modern architectural techniques and authentic traditional design featuring imposing pillars, spectacular roofs, ornate carvings and intricate embellishments. Its grand architecture has made it as one of the tourist destination. The front entrance of the temple features a multi-arched gateway with red pillars, the colour symbolic of prosperity and good fortune. Souvenir stalls and a canteen are found on the first level. The second level houses the multi-purpose hall while offices are located on the third level. The fourth level has three tiers and the prayer hall is located here.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Prayer hall ===\n\nThe prayer hall houses three altars, each with a sculpture of one deity or goddess. The altar on the right is dedicated to Guan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy. Tian Hou is in the centre while Shui Wei Sheng Niang (the Goddess of the Waterfront) is at the left. In the middle of the hall and between the altars are two pairs of Kau Cim oracles that can be used by visitors. Despite the dedication to Tian Hou, worship of Guan Yin is a recurrent theme at the temple.\n\n\n=== External ===\nIn addition to her altar in the prayer hall, there is a smaller statue of Guan Yin to the right of the hall, set amongst rocks and falling water. Here one can kneel and receive a blessing of water from the statue. Outside the temple at the entrance to the grounds, there is a larger statue, similarly set amongst rocks and falling water. Other features include a Chinese Medicinal Herbs Garden, a Wishing Well as well as a Tortoise Pond. There is also a large statue of the goddess opposite the temple, along with a collection of other large statues that include representations of the twelve animals of Chinese astrology.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Religious and cultural ===\nActivities such as the grand birthday celebrations for Goddess Tian Hou, Goddess Kuan Yin and the Goddess of the Waterfront are conducted at Thean Hou. Buddhist activities include Dharma Prayers and Wesak Day celebrations. Cultural activities include the annual Mid-Autumn Festival during the eighth lunar month and the Chinese New Year celebration. In 2019, the temple was allocated RM30,000 by the federal government to encourage them to hold more cultural events.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe temple also offers fortune-telling and marriage registration services and traditional Chinese exercise and martial arts activities such as qigong, tai chi and wushu classes are conducted at the temple compound.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Thean Hou Temple at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Kuala Lumpur (Malaysian pronunciation: [\u02c8kual\u0259, -a \u02c8lumpo(r), -\u028a(r)]), officially the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (Malay: Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Jawi: \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u06a4\u0631\u0633\u0643\u0648\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0645\u06a4\u0648\u0631; Chinese: \u5409\u9686\u5761\u806f\u90a6\u76f4\u8f44\u5340; Tamil: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb2\u0bbe \u0bb2\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd) and commonly known as KL, is the national capital and largest city in Malaysia. As the global city of Malaysia, it covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016. Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the Klang Valley, is an urban agglomeration of 7.25 million people as of 2017. It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.\nKuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Malaysian King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong), the Istana Negara. The city once held the headquarters of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government, but these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999. However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three federal territories of Malaysia, enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Towers, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysian development.\nKuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, such as mass rapid transit (MRT), light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, public buses, hop on & hop off buses (free of charge) and airport rail links. Kuala Lumpur is one of the leading cities in the world for tourism and shopping, being the 10th most-visited city in the world in 2017. The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.Kuala Lumpur has been ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking at No. 70 in the world, and No. 2 in Southeast Asia after Singapore.  Kuala Lumpur was named as one of the New7Wonders Cities, and has been named as World Book Capital 2020 by UNESCO.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nKuala Lumpur means \"muddy confluence\" in Malay; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means \"mud\". One suggestion is that it was named after Sungai Lumpur (\"muddy river\"); it was recorded in the 1820s that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River. Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak as the point where one river joins a larger one or the sea is its kuala. It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur in fact extended down to the confluence (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), although Sungai Lumpur is said to be another river joining the Klang River a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence, or perhaps located to the north of the Batu Caves area.It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (\"muddy landing place\") in the same way that Klang was once called Pengkalan Batu (\"stone landing place\"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur. Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIt is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang (Klang River) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut, raised funds from Malaccan Chinese businessmen to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines.\n\nAlthough the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from these mines was exported in 1859. At that time Sutan Puasa was already trading near Ampang, two traders from Lukut, Hiu Siew and Yap Ah Sze, then arrived in Kuala Lumpur where they set up shops to sell provisions to miners in exchange for tin. The town, spurred on by tin-mining, started to develop centred on Old Market Square (Medan Pasar), with roads radiating out towards Ampang as well as Pudu and Batu (the destinations became the names of these roads) where miners also started to settled in, and Petaling and Damansara. The miners formed gangs among themselves; and fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, particularly between factions of Kuala Lumpur and Kanching, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew the early Chinese trader was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, was appointed in 1868.Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include Haji Mohamed Tahir who became the Dato Dagang (\"chief of traders\"). The Minangkabaus from Sumatra became another important group of peoples who traded and established tobacco plantations in the area. Notable Minangkabaus include their headman Dato' Sati, Utsman Abdullah, and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru. The Minangkabaus were also significant socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.\n\n\n=== Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur ===\n\nEarly Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems \u2013 the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang. The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy. Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban centre.\n\nThe early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River \u2013 the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarters was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897.Frank Swettenham, on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated in 1884 that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the \"five-foot ways\" as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court. With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest.\n\nA railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.\n\n\n=== 20th century\u2013present ===\n\nThe area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2, and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory.The development of rubber industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based elsewhere also found a presence here.\n\nDuring World War II, Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage during the course of the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishir\u014d Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.The first municipal election in Kuala Lumpur was held on 16 February 1952. An ad hoc alliance between the Malay UMNO and Chinese MCA party candidates won a majority of the seats contested, and their success led to the formation of the Alliance Party (later the Barisan Nasional). On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. The British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang on the midnight of 30 August 1957, and in the morning of 31 August, the ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963.\n\nKuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.\nKuala Lumpur achieved city status on 1 February 1972, becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function, and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, major urban developments in the Klang Valley have resulted in an extended Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. This area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur, extends from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur westward to Port Klang, east to the edge of the Titiwangsa Mountains as well as to the north and south. The area covers other administratively separate towns and cities such as Klang, Shah Alam, Putrajaya and others, and it is served by the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. Notable projects undertaken within Kuala Lumpur itself include the development of a new Kuala Lumpur City Centre around Jalan Ampang and the Petronas Towers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley. The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to \"muddy confluence\" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers.\n\nLocated in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was a territory of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location within the most developed state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi), with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft).\n\n\n=== Climate and weather ===\nProtected by the Titiwangsa Range in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur is safe from strong winds and has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 35 \u00b0C (90 and 95 \u00b0F) and sometimes hit 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 \u00b0C (74.1 and 76.3 \u00b0F) and have never fallen below 17.8 \u00b0C (64.0 \u00b0F). Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month.\nFlood is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur after heavy downpours, especially in the city centre, because the structural irrigation lags behind the intensive development within the city. Smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nKuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who has been in office since 18 July 2015.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia. It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur's eleven districts, with estimated population and percentage of the total, serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall authority.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nKuala Lumpur is home to the Parliament of Malaysia. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, has stipulated the three branches, of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branches. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya, certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia (National Bank of Malaysia), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city.The city remains as the economic and business hub in the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city, and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang, the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.\nBursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. By 2015, the GDP has reached RM160,388 million, representing 15.1% of the total GDP of Malaysia. The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 was RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent, and RM94,722 in 2015. Average monthly household income is RM9,073 (~$2,200) as of 2016, growing at a pace of approximately 6% a year. The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the country's largest companies have their headquarters here, and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas, there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur.Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists.\nThere has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions\u2014 has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000 sq m-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.\n\nThe major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the PETRONAS Twin Towers, the Bukit Bintang shopping district, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, Petaling Street (Chinatown), the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the National Palace (Istana Negara), the National Museum, Islamic Arts Museum, Central Market, KL Bird Park, Aquaria KLCC, the National Monument, and religious sites such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Jamek Mosque, Thean Hou Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfield. Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor.The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing  Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. Trendy nightclubs, bars and lounges, such as Marini's on 57, Skybar at Traders Hotel, the Beach Club, Espanda, the Hakka Republic Wine Bar & Restaurant, Hard Rock Cafe, the Luna Bar, Nuovo, Rum Jungle, No Black Tie, the Thai Club, Zion club, Zouk, and many others are located here.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nKuala Lumpur alone has 66 shopping malls and is the retail and fashion hub in Malaysia as well as Southeast Asia. Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (US$2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006.\n\nSuria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier upscale shopping destination due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers.\nApart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungei Wang Plaza and Quill City Mall. Changkat area of Bukit Bintang hosts various cafes, alfresco dining outlets and illegal activities. Bangsar district also has a few shopping complexes, including Bangsar Village, Bangsar Shopping Centre, and Mid Valley Megamall.\nApart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles, fabrics and handicrafts. The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street, is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences.Since 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event at the time is held three times a year \u2013 in March, May and December \u2013 during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia which being maintained until present with new mega sales.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.76 million in the city proper as of 2016. It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites. Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley metropolitan (covering Petaling Jaya, Klang, Subang Jaya, Puchong, Shah Alam, Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.25 million as of 2017.Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians, as well as Kadazans, Ibans and other indigenous races from around Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Historical demographics ===\n\nHistorically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a \"purely Chinese village\", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war). The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2\u2013300, many of whom then brought their families here. Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka \u5ba2\u5bb6\u4eba), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another perhaps more accurate estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. The rubber boom in the early 20th century lead to a further increase in population, from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into Malaysia, many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits.Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people \u2013 the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. On the other hand, the working age group of 15\u201359 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays, the Indian Muslim communities and a small number of Chinese Muslims. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity.As of 2010 Census, the population of Kuala Lumpur was 46.4% Muslim, 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu, 5.8% Christian, 1.4% of unknown affiliations, 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 0.6% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three states where less than 50% of the population are self-identified Muslims, the other two being Penang and Sarawak.\nStatistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 87.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (7.9%), Chinese folk religions (2.7%) and Muslims (0.6%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (81.1%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Christians (7.8%), Muslims (4.9%) and Buddhists (2.1%). The non-Malay bumiputera community are predominantly Christians (44.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (31.2%) and Buddhists (13.5%). All bumiputera Malays are Muslim; this is due to the criterion in the definition of a Malay in the Malaysian constitution that they should adhere to Islam.Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. Malaysian English is a variant widely used. It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken by minorities include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi, and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles \u2013 Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.\nIndependence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Telekom Tower, Maybank Tower, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world and the tallest buildings in the country. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe Lake Gardens, a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Parliament building is located close by, and Carcosa Seri Negara which was once the official residence of British colonial administration is also sited here. The park includes a Butterfly Park, Deer Park, Orchid Garden, Hibiscus Garden and the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, which is the world's largest aviary bird park. Other parks in the city include the ASEAN Sculpture Garden, KLCC Park, Titiwangsa Lake Gardens, Metropolitan Lake Gardens in Kepong, Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, Taman Tasik Permaisuri (Queen's Lake Gardens), Bukit Kiara Botanical Gardens, Equestrian Park and West Valley Park near TTDI, and Bukit Jalil International Park.\nThere are three forest reserves within the city namely the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve in the city centre, the oldest gazetted forest reserve in the country 10.52 ha or 26.0 acres, Bukit Sungai Putih Forest Reserve (7.41 ha or 18.3 acres) and Bukit Sungai Besi Forest Reserve (42.11 ha or 104.1 acres). Bukit Nanas, in the heart of the city centre, is one of the oldest virgin forests in the world within a city. These residual forest areas are home to a number of fauna species particularly monkeys, treeshrews, pygmy goats, budgerigars, squirrels and birds.\nThere is another park in the close vicinity to Kuala Lumpur i.e. Templer Park initiated and opened by Sir Gerald Templer in 1954 during the \"Emergency\" time.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAccording to government statistics, Kuala Lumpur has a literacy rate of 97.5% in 2000, the highest rate in any state or territory in Malaysia.\nIn Malaysia, Malay is the language of instruction for most subjects while English is a compulsory subject, but as of 2012, English is still the language of instruction for mathematics and the natural sciences for certain schools. Some schools provide Mandarin and Tamil as languages of instruction for certain subjects.

Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.\n\nIn terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of city. The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres, an airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eight minutes and costs RM 55 (roughly US$13.50), while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70).

As of 2018, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as Firefly and Malindo Air.Public transport in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006.

Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, mass rapid transit (MRT) and airport rail link. The LRT system has three lines, Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line and Sri Petaling Line, connecting many locations within the city and surrounding suburbs. The KL Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter and MRT connect the city centre with other suburbs and cities of the Klang Valley. The main railway hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the most of the rail lines. KL Sentral is also a hub for the intercity railway service KTM ETS, which travels from north to south Peninsular Malaysia through the city centre. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more railway lines due for completion or in the pipeline, such as the Putrajaya Line and Bandar Utama-Klang Line.\nThe largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus, using Rapid KL brand name. Since the take over from Intrakota Komposit Sdn Bhd, Prasarana Malaysia has redrawn the entire bus network of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley metropolitan area to increase passenger numbers and improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The Prasarana Malaysia has adopted the hub and spoke system to provide greater connectivity, and cut down the need of more buses.In Kuala Lumpur, most taxis have distinctive white and red liveries. Kuala Lumpur is one of the major ASEAN city with taxis extensively running on natural gas. Taxis can be hailed from taxi stands or from the streets.

The port is the largest and busiest in the country handling about 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargo in 2006.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nKuala Lumpur is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Kuala Lumpur\nPutrajaya\nCyberjaya\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGullick, J.M.

The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.Kuala Lumpur has been ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking at No. 70 in the world, and No. 2 in Southeast Asia after Singapore.  Kuala Lumpur was named as one of the New7Wonders Cities, and has been named as World Book Capital 2020 by UNESCO.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nKuala Lumpur means \"muddy confluence\" in Malay; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means \"mud\". One suggestion is that it was named after Sungai Lumpur (\"muddy river\"); it was recorded in the 1820s that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River. Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak as the point where one river joins a larger one or the sea is its kuala. It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur in fact extended down to the confluence (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), although Sungai Lumpur is said to be another river joining the Klang River a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence, or perhaps located to the north of the Batu Caves area.It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (\"muddy landing place\") in the same way that Klang was once called Pengkalan Batu (\"stone landing place\"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur. Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIt is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang (Klang River) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut, raised funds from Malaccan Chinese businessmen to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines.\n\nAlthough the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from these mines was exported in 1859. At that time Sutan Puasa was already trading near Ampang, two traders from Lukut, Hiu Siew and Yap Ah Sze, then arrived in Kuala Lumpur where they set up shops to sell provisions to miners in exchange for tin. The town, spurred on by tin-mining, started to develop centred on Old Market Square (Medan Pasar), with roads radiating out towards Ampang as well as Pudu and Batu (the destinations became the names of these roads) where miners also started to settled in, and Petaling and Damansara. The miners formed gangs among themselves; and fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, particularly between factions of Kuala Lumpur and Kanching, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew the early Chinese trader was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, was appointed in 1868.Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include Haji Mohamed Tahir who became the Dato Dagang (\"chief of traders\"). The Minangkabaus from Sumatra became another important group of peoples who traded and established tobacco plantations in the area. Notable Minangkabaus include their headman Dato' Sati, Utsman Abdullah, and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru. The Minangkabaus were also significant socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.\n\n\n=== Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur ===\n\nEarly Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems \u2013 the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang. The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy. Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban centre.\n\nThe early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River \u2013 the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarters was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897.Frank Swettenham, on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated in 1884 that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the \"five-foot ways\" as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court. With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest.\n\nA railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.\n\n\n=== 20th century\u2013present ===\n\nThe area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2, and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory.The development of rubber industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based elsewhere also found a presence here.\n\nDuring World War II, Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage during the course of the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishir\u014d Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.The first municipal election in Kuala Lumpur was held on 16 February 1952. An ad hoc alliance between the Malay UMNO and Chinese MCA party candidates won a majority of the seats contested, and their success led to the formation of the Alliance Party (later the Barisan Nasional). On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. The British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang on the midnight of 30 August 1957, and in the morning of 31 August, the ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963.\n\nKuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.\nKuala Lumpur achieved city status on 1 February 1972, becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function, and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, major urban developments in the Klang Valley have resulted in an extended Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. This area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur, extends from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur westward to Port Klang, east to the edge of the Titiwangsa Mountains as well as to the north and south. The area covers other administratively separate towns and cities such as Klang, Shah Alam, Putrajaya and others, and it is served by the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. Notable projects undertaken within Kuala Lumpur itself include the development of a new Kuala Lumpur City Centre around Jalan Ampang and the Petronas Towers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley. The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to \"muddy confluence\" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers.\n\nLocated in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was a territory of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location within the most developed state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi), with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft).\n\n\n=== Climate and weather ===\nProtected by the Titiwangsa Range in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur is safe from strong winds and has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 35 \u00b0C (90 and 95 \u00b0F) and sometimes hit 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 \u00b0C (74.1 and 76.3 \u00b0F) and have never fallen below 17.8 \u00b0C (64.0 \u00b0F). Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month.\nFlood is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur after heavy downpours, especially in the city centre, because the structural irrigation lags behind the intensive development within the city. Smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nKuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who has been in office since 18 July 2015.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia. It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur's eleven districts, with estimated population and percentage of the total, serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall authority.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nKuala Lumpur is home to the Parliament of Malaysia. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, has stipulated the three branches, of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branches. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya, certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia (National Bank of Malaysia), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city.The city remains as the economic and business hub in the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city, and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang, the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.\nBursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. By 2015, the GDP has reached RM160,388 million, representing 15.1% of the total GDP of Malaysia. The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 was RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent, and RM94,722 in 2015. Average monthly household income is RM9,073 (~$2,200) as of 2016, growing at a pace of approximately 6% a year. The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the country's largest companies have their headquarters here, and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas, there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur.Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists.\nThere has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions\u2014 has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000 sq m-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.\n\nThe major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the PETRONAS Twin Towers, the Bukit Bintang shopping district, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, Petaling Street (Chinatown), the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the National Palace (Istana Negara), the National Museum, Islamic Arts Museum, Central Market, KL Bird Park, Aquaria KLCC, the National Monument, and religious sites such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Jamek Mosque, Thean Hou Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfield. Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor.The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing  Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. Trendy nightclubs, bars and lounges, such as Marini's on 57, Skybar at Traders Hotel, the Beach Club, Espanda, the Hakka Republic Wine Bar & Restaurant, Hard Rock Cafe, the Luna Bar, Nuovo, Rum Jungle, No Black Tie, the Thai Club, Zion club, Zouk, and many others are located here.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nKuala Lumpur alone has 66 shopping malls and is the retail and fashion hub in Malaysia as well as Southeast Asia. Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (US$2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006.\n\nSuria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier upscale shopping destination due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers.\nApart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungei Wang Plaza and Quill City Mall. Changkat area of Bukit Bintang hosts various cafes, alfresco dining outlets and illegal activities. Bangsar district also has a few shopping complexes, including Bangsar Village, Bangsar Shopping Centre, and Mid Valley Megamall.\nApart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles, fabrics and handicrafts. The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street, is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences.Since 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event at the time is held three times a year \u2013 in March, May and December \u2013 during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia which being maintained until present with new mega sales.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.76 million in the city proper as of 2016. It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites. Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley metropolitan (covering Petaling Jaya, Klang, Subang Jaya, Puchong, Shah Alam, Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.25 million as of 2017.Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians, as well as Kadazans, Ibans and other indigenous races from around Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Historical demographics ===\n\nHistorically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a \"purely Chinese village\", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war). The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2\u2013300, many of whom then brought their families here. Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka \u5ba2\u5bb6\u4eba), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another perhaps more accurate estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. The rubber boom in the early 20th century lead to a further increase in population, from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into Malaysia, many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits.Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people \u2013 the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. On the other hand, the working age group of 15\u201359 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays, the Indian Muslim communities and a small number of Chinese Muslims. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity.As of 2010 Census, the population of Kuala Lumpur was 46.4% Muslim, 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu, 5.8% Christian, 1.4% of unknown affiliations, 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 0.6% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three states where less than 50% of the population are self-identified Muslims, the other two being Penang and Sarawak.\nStatistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 87.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (7.9%), Chinese folk religions (2.7%) and Muslims (0.6%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (81.1%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Christians (7.8%), Muslims (4.9%) and Buddhists (2.1%). The non-Malay bumiputera community are predominantly Christians (44.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (31.2%) and Buddhists (13.5%). All bumiputera Malays are Muslim; this is due to the criterion in the definition of a Malay in the Malaysian constitution that they should adhere to Islam.Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. Malaysian English is a variant widely used. It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken by minorities include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi, and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles \u2013 Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.\nIndependence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Telekom Tower, Maybank Tower, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world and the tallest buildings in the country. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe Lake Gardens, a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur.

Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.\n\nIn terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of city. The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres, an airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eight minutes and costs RM 55 (roughly US$13.50), while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal but from KLIA2 which is two kilometres from KLIA.

As of 2018, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as Firefly and Malindo Air.Public transport in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the expansion of the rail network. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, mass rapid transit (MRT) and airport rail link. The LRT system has three lines, Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line and Sri Petaling Line, connecting many locations within the city and surrounding suburbs. The KL Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter and MRT connect the city centre with other suburbs and cities of the Klang Valley. The main railway hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the most of the rail lines. KL Sentral is also a hub for the intercity railway service KTM ETS, which travels from north to south Peninsular Malaysia through the city centre. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more railway lines due for completion or in the pipeline, such as the Putrajaya Line and Bandar Utama-Klang Line.\nThe largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus, using Rapid KL brand name.

        "wiki": "The National Zoo (Malay: Zoo Negara) is a zoo in Malaysia located on 110 acres (45 ha) of land in Ulu Klang, Gombak District, Selangor, Malaysia. It was officially opened on 14 November 1963 by the country's first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. The park is managed by a non-governmental organisation known as the Malaysian Zoological Society. For funding, Zoo Negara relies on gate collections and on support from donors and sponsors.\nZoo Negara is home to 5137 animals of 476 different species. Over the years, the zoo has transformed itself to an open concept zoo with over 90% of its animals kept in spacious exhibits with landscape befitting its nature.\nZoo Negara received MS ISO 9001:2008 certification in July 2007, and is a member of the South East Asian Zoos Association (SEAZA). The President and chairman of the zoo is Y. Bhg. Dato' Ismail Hutson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1957, the Malayan Agri-Horticultural Association (MAHA) opened a miniature zoo. After the creation of the mini-zoo, the idea of proper zoo gradually gained momentum, and the federal government chose a spot in Ulu Klang, Selangor next to the border of Kuala Lumpur. In the 1960s, Ulu Klang was an undeveloped green area. In 1963, the first Prime Minister of Malaya (now Malaysia) YTM Tunku Abdul Rahman opened the zoo to the public. Zoo Negara was known as the \"Zoo in the Jungle\" due to the greenery that surrounded the area.\nThe zoo welcomed its millionth visitor on 14 February 1966, just three years after opening, and by 1986, the zoo was welcoming over 1 million visitors per year.The area surrounding the zoo was covered with thick vegetation until the late 1970s as Kuala Lumpur underwent an economic boom. Given Ulu Klang's close proximity with Kuala Lumpur, the area was opened for large scale development as a planned residential area in the 1980s. It has expanded in terms of population ever since. The development has caused the zoo's surrounding areas and also increases the land value where the zoo is located.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were plans to move the zoo to other locations in Selangor. However, the plans were largely unpopular among the public as it is seen as an effort by some developers to capitalise on the value of the zoo's large land. With the support from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the [Selangor] State Government, Zoo Negara will not be relocated.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nUsing Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2) \u2013 from Ampang, u-turn at the Taman Melawati exit and take the first left; from Gombak, take the first left after the Taman Melawati exit flyover.\nHop on the Metrobus bus 16 from Central Market. This bus will bring you to the zoo entrance.\nRapid KL bus number 253 from Putra LRT station, Wangsa Maju, or Rapid KL bus number 220 from Lebuh Ampang.\nUsing Kelana Jaya Line LRT, get down at the Wangsa Maju LRT station and take a taxi or the feeder bus to the zoo.\n\n\n== Opening Hours ==\nOpen daily from 9am to 5pm. Last admission at 4pm. The zoo is wheel-chair friendly. Guests with special needs should proceed to Information Counter B beside the ticket counter to seek assistance from the guest service ambassadors.\n\n\n== Admission Fees (info as of May 2019) ==\nMalaysian: Adult RM45.00, Senior Citizen RM23, Children RM18.\nForeigner: Adult RM61 for ASEAN nationals. RM82 for others.\nChildren: RM33 for ASEAN nationals, RM43 for others.\ni-Kad / Working Permit / Dependant Pass :-\nAdult: Rm50, Children: Rm25\nSchool Concession Rate: RM13.00 Student, RM17.00 per head for Teacher with min 10 students\nOKU / Disabled person with Certificate: Free\n\n\n== Tram Ride ==\nThe tram route services eight stops, T1 to T8, via a counter clockwise route. Fees are as follows:\nAdult: RM8 with Mykad (RM11 without)\nChildren: RM5 with Mykad (RM9 without)\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThere are 16 exhibits in this zoo. They are:\n\nReptile ParkThe Reptile Park has both indoor and outdoor exhibits, and includes estuarine or saltwater crocodiles, freshwater crocodiles, false gharials, and African dwarf crocodiles.

          "My 2 year old niece was along to witness her first pandas. Panda enclosures are adequate. I especially like the overhead bridge viewing concept. Upkeep of the zoo in general has improved tremendously since panda arrival. Souvenir stops are great too - again check out the one",
          "For a tourist attraction to be named \" National \" is not what is expected. ZOOs in any country is a major attraction. Children love them n parents take children to the Zoo just to introduce them to the \" wild animals\" seen only in TV. Personally I pity the stress wild animals in",
          "What wait we there is just panda, other than that all animals just look old and tired. Better thing is still can view some white tigers, lions and cheetah, hypo around and a lovely large lake in the center of the park that full with open birds. And the most amazing and",
          "The Panda Mummy and her baby is so cute. You will be charmed. Other animals are so and so. But to look at the panda so near is such a blessed! Plus they are the only place u can have aircond and cool yourself down.",
          "The zoo have few animals, especially, they have kute pandas but have a lot of garbage. must clean them everyday",
          "The are few animals and a lot of empty cages. A lot of garbage in zoo. Overall below average and not worth visiting. We prefer the zoo in Singapore.",
          "Very poor zoo. Few animals and long distance to walk, lot of unused space. Not clean, lot of garbage everywhere, no enough signs with explanations which direction to go. Only nice things in whole zoo are Pandas. Definitely not worth of time and money for entrance.",
          "This zoo is not as much as you expect,because most people refer to it to see pandas,especially their baby,but we spent 4 hours and nothing being happened",
          "I can't put my thoughts together to write a review for this place as it's just not up to standard at all, at least from me. First of, the animals look okay. They are well fed and look healthy. But most seems to become either lazy or so well trained that they depend on command",
          "Except for the pandas there were really nothing else that is really worth watching. Quite a number of the enclosures for animals and aquariums are empty. Upkeep and maintenance looks lacking. Some enclosures are exceptionally smelly and the grass overgrown. it looks as if",
          "The place has changed a lot since the last time I got here, like 20 years or something. The iconic main gate still there. Gosh this really brings back those memories when I was still a kid. Unfortunately, a few attractions were close. Miss the snakes, and a few other animals",
          "This zoo is awesome in terms of wide variety of species from different part of the world. The Panda section really amaze you and the open amphitheater will give some light moment after a long walk. You will certainly carry good memories of seeing white tiger, Lion , Rhino &",
          "This place is dirty and not organized. The only good area is the panda area. The price is quite steep for such a zoo. Improvement is required.",
          "very difficult to reach by public transport so leaves you exposed to the local rip off taxis. Got a metered taxi from train station, showed 8 on meter which was quickly switched off and a demand for 15, paid up as couldnt be bothered to argue. On leaving the zoo the taxis in the",

          "A very fun place to bring your kids. Especially to the butterfly farm. However the zoo needs a bit of maintenance work done. If you're lucky enough, you can get to catch the free live animal show. Overall a very pleasant day.",
          "I never had a strong opinion on how aninmals should be treated but This zoo gave me one. 1 lonely camel, 2 hungry elephants and a couple of bears begging for bread (I didn't know this is what bears eat). Anyways, the pandas are cute and impressive they look like they have a nice",
          "if i was given choose between many zoo i will choose zoo negara because it has a charm i went their for a feild trip.",
          "This is one zoo that makes me feel so bad aftet visiting it. Enclosures are too small for the animals, unkempt, toilets are gross, smelly. The saddest one is the penguin enclosure. No way to keep penguins in place like that. Small, dirty water, just sad. Do something about this,",
          "Considering its the national zoo of malaysia, I think it could be better maintained, some sections are dirty eg- otters we're swimming in dirty fish water. Bring an umbrella, sunglasses, water. Panda enclosure is quite good. Animals in the Singapore zoo looked happier though.",
          "After many years of not going to the Zoo Negara, I decidedly to give it another chance, especially after the panda pair successfully gave birth to a baby panda. But I must say, it never improved after all these years. To start with, the overall facilities looks like it was",
          "Pretty cool place (temperature wise it's very hot) but still nothing compared to the Singapore Zoo. Some highlights though that are better or on par with similar Singapore facilities include the Panda exhibit and the open air, ground level lion and tiger exhibit. The elephant",
          "We went there for a good vacation with kids expecting that its well maintained since we have been many times to Taiping Zoo. For a change we went to KL Zoo. I am really dissappointed with the condition of the zoo. At one glance its like abondoned Jurassic park. 1. Fee for a",
          "A nicely laid out zoo for visitors and residents (animals). Cost of entry was fairly high for foreigners compared to residents. If going in July, suggest to go in the morning when it is cooler, but there are some air conditioned facilities and plenty of shady places to catch a",
          "I did not enjoy my time here at all. The animals seem depressed and unhealthy, which is not surprising seeing as a lot of the cages are just metal meshing. The zoo has no atmosphere and needs massive renovations. It seems that they blew all their money on a panda centre, where",
          "First thing first.. I hope animals at this zoo are having a good life and they fully deserve it as they are contributing a lot for improving economy... I mean this place is damn expensive. RM 85 for foreign nationals but why so I don't know. Every country has zoo. Why foreigners",
          "The zoo getting less and less diversity of animals, I did not even see a lion during my visit. The aquarium glass was full of stains and you hardly see the animal inside. However, this place is still suitable for family trip and it has a Panda Conservative Center now. It is",
          "i) I do not understand for a price tag of RM42 (normal price for Malaysian), Zoo even not give you a free map. A map is selling at RM 1, sounds like Malaysia is begging for that RM1, sounds very cheap. ii) Those photographers very annoying. They asked us to pose around 20 pose,",
          "The ticket price is considered as worthy as it included entrance to panda park. Other than viewing panda which is a fresh experience for us who live in malaysia, other animals are listless and keep sleeping and hiding. Also i cant understand why the park selling their map for",
          "Just your average malaysian zoo except this one has got pandas in it... Yes, you heard me right. We have got a pair of pandas in Zoo Negara. Must visit. There is no need to spends thousands of ringgit to fly to china anymore.",
          "Weather is hot as usual. A good place for bonding between parents and children. Don't put high expectation on it. Staffs are just ok. There are some aircond rooms for us to rest after some walk, not bad. We leave after the animal show. Overall experience is ok.",
          "Originally we were planning to go to the Farm In the City, but they were close that day so we visited the Zoo which I guessed shouldn't be that bad. As long as we walked in, I found the area is so rundown. The animals look sad and most of them are badly treated and the cages",
          "Having visited malacca zoo a couple of months ago... i would have high expectation of the national zoo. Unfortunately. Malacca zoo is in a much better state as compared to zoo negara. Animals looks more vibrant and probably due to a well maintained habitats than the latter.",

          "We visited this zoo and we were really surprised with the amount of animals it had. My son loved the monkeys and tigers. But the best has to be the pandas. We missed the feeding time, which would have been better as they were asleep when we got there. But still great to see",
          "The diversity is overwhelming. This place is a treasure to the city and surrounding provinces. The facilities are well kept, and the animals well fed. One can spend an entire day inside and it may not be enough.",
          "I have seen a lot of zoos in my time. This one is very nice. Nice sized yards for the animals as well as places to get away from the sun as well as back away from the public. The big cats (lions and tigers) have a very low barrier (be safe and don't reach or drop anything over)",
          "We book through the website through email for the panda volunteer day program. It started from 8am till 4 pm. As we arrive we went to the zoo office and paid our ticket at the front entrance . And we were usher to the panda observatory center . Breakfast and lunch is provided",
          "Come here with my family. RM44 per person (Malaysian with IC holder). The animals are not really active. All of them are sleeping and the pandas also. But only the giraffe are not. The food in there are really expensive. Need more improvement. If you love pandas, it was worth to",
          "Ok I won't talk about the operations of the zoo staff, parking etc as this is Malaysia, we already know how bad it is. Let's look at the zoo itself. I had the unfortunate pleasure of visiting this pathetic zoo with a few friends. I love animals and I sorta knew what I was in",

          "I remember the good old days when the price was ten ringgit for adult admission. The prices have gone up astronomically to the point that it is even more expensive than zoos in the first world. On top of that, there are silly money-grabbing activities like coercing you to have",
          "Malaysia is a hot country. Ok, but 90% were under shaded canopies at the far end of enclosures, away from the viewing walkways. It would be better if the shaded animal enclosures were closer to the public. Very difficult to see anything after spending RM 85, about \u00a314. However",
          "Visited the zoo a couple of days ago and it is definitely NOT recommended, even if you're too bored at home. Sleepy and unhappy animals captivated in poorly maintained exhibit. Did not see ANY of the workers/zookeepers around the zoo doing work. Upsetting surrounding and dirty",

          "I once visited Singapore zoo when small time, and I once tasted the KFC in Zoo Negara when small time. It's no longer the same as what I have expected to be when I bring my daughter to go to this zoo. What I didn't expect is the zoo landscape is surrounded by resident houses,",

          "I was curious to see what has changed since my last visit back in 1987, well... I was shocked to pay entrance fee of RM54 per person including access to the panda centre. They even charging the map for RM1!! What a load of rubbish... We opted to snap the zoo map with our phone",

          "My 3 kids really enjoyed their time here. We spent almost 5 hours thoroughly visiting each section. The aquarium is such a surprise. It was big with a lot of fishes on display. The butterfly park was also nice. The highlight of our visit was being able to see the white tiger",
          "Absolutely terrible! The whole place is in dire and urgent need of restoration work. Many enclosures are closed altogether or in a state of disrepair. Many of the animals are either sick or look sick and/or distressed. It cost us Rm108 for two people and foreigners get",
          "I have not visited Zoo Negara in decades and decided to pay a visit mostly to see the new baby panda. The place is generally in a bad condition, stuck in a time warp of the 70s/80s. Some cages are abandoned, path with giant potholes and abandoned structures here and there all in",
          "I am not really a fan of zoos. We took our toddler. We had to pay extra to see the panda. A lot of construction going on and some of the enclosures were empty. Personally I feel the animals did not look that they were treated or fed well. They looked ill and scrawny . The",
          "Went last week with my 5, 3 and 1 year(s) old children. The walk around the zoo was tolerable for the young children but do bring a stroller for the tired little legs. The animals in the enclosures looked well taken cared off. The pandas are worthwhile to see if you haven't seen",
          "We were disappointed with our visit to the Zoo as there are large areas under construction. The entire centre area is off limits during this period. The animal show is very small as the previous area is also being reconstructed and there was no room to sit down for anyone with a",
          "Went around all the exhibits. The advertised live animal show with the sea life was not available. The entire amphitheatre was under construction or rebuilding. Actually construction areas were not very well cordoned off and there were heavy construction vehicles going along all",
          "Overall satisfied as compared to 5 years ago. At least there are more animals and cleaner. But staff is not well train. We have waited for over 1.5 hours to see the baby panda since was informed only open at 2pm. Was asked to queue 30 mins before 2pm, so we did so.",
          "I didnt find anything extraordinary in the zoo, however the animals were well fed and maintained. Didnt feel the need to pay extra for the Panda, hence, didnt go there, but other animals were worth my time.",
          "The animal exhibitions are average except that some animals have only 1 amount per enclosure(which is sad). Reptile exhibition was closed during our visit.. You pay an extra RM20+ for the panda exhibition which is not worth it...",

          "I reached there difficultly but It really worth .I haven't seen so many species in my life that there were all available . It was really like heaven I dreamed before. And also the lovely pandas were so cute and attractive. I just hope there were a metro or any subway",
          "One of the high-lights was the bee museum. You get to look inside the hives of the jungle bees and taste their honey. Well worth every cent (around US$/\u20ac 17 incl. Panda Conservation center). And yes, alot of the exhibits are being rebuild... but there's still alot to see!",
          "Between 2005 and 2008 I went there quite a few times and enjoyed it. But I was a little disappointed this last time I went there. Some parts of the park is really good. The panda enclosure was great and some others to. But a lot of the park is in bad shape right now. They are",
          "Zoo is quite ok, but considered costly . If u want to see the panda , u need to pay extra which was not at all fare.",
          "Love zoos so great to see white tigers and pandas , amazing to see how close lions and tigers were without any railings up ! Lots of work being done so would like to see once work completed and missed mother and baby panda so would like to return to see them",
          "The tickets are definitely over-priced. The zoo needs serious maintenance. The animals need more attention.",
          "Wanted to see some animals and began quite skeptical about going to the zoo.. but me and my friend thought it was well, saw different kinds of animals. sometimes we thought they could use more space but most of the time it was okay for the animals. it is quite hard to reach with",
          "Visited with my kids. Nice and enjoyable for the kids as well as adults eye opening to wild life and knowledgeable. But sad with the way some animals are caged and the attitude of the visiting public who feed the all kinds of stuff while not being monitored. I really loved",
          "visited the Zoo Negara with my 5 year old son. The Zoo Negara is a bit difficult to get to with public transport. I used a taxi. Also the taxi drivers at the Zoo charge unreasonable fees and thus must be avoided. The zoo itself is huge with variety of options. You need to buy",
          "I know that money has been spent on this zoo but I cant help but feel depressed for the animals showcased. Its sadly inadequate and not up to world class standards (there are worse in Malaysia which is more upsetting) Not worth the visit",
          "We enjoyed the butterfly garden, and the creepy-crawlies. The rest was rather average, many cages held solo animals, and many animals were trying to return to their internal enclosures. Probably the heat. We paid extra and noted the high quality of this Panda enclosure. There",
          "The entrence fee is extreemly high at Negara Zoo. Actually the price level is above many ZOOs in Western Europe! On top of this you are being punished paying extra if you aren't a Malaysian citizen. Why? In addition to this you will have to pay extra for seeing the Gem of the",
          "The facilities were awful, animals are still kept in the cage due to lack of manpower to maintain the Zoo. Shows and performance were on time but lack of interaction between crowd and animals presenters. Panda were inactive, ostrich were not release at 10 am in the morning,",
          "Great morning out. Take a taxi and go to the zoo. (but not a metered taxi, and i mean take a taxi) it cost less than a tour and you don't have to wait for others. (agree on price before you go, with a red an white taxi). We have been to many zoo's around the world and this one",
          "good place for family and kids as friendly staff can walk long time but always don't forget ur Umbrella",
          "We returned here as my wife couldn't make it last time, the highlight for the kids was a 10 minute 4d ride/ show (at extra cost) which probably says it all about how they found the rest of the zoo. On entrance they informed us that most of the pandas were in quarantine so I",
          "My daughter wanted to see the zoo, so we used MyTeksi appl to book a grab car premium to get from Sunway Putra Hotel to the Zoo, which was 40 Rm. Tickets to the zoo were 85 Rm/person, including Panda visit. We caught also a multi-animal show, with sea lions, macaques and macaw",
          "The zoo was recently refurbished and is located in a serene and scenic location. The main feature that distinguishes the zoo with the others is its concept of mostly animals are let to roam freely which closely resembles their natural habitat. The zoo is beautifully landscaped",
          "An attraction for the children. It was under renovation. Many pathways were blocked and was very tiring to move around. Requires a lot of maintenance and re planning to improve layout. Many cages were either in accessible or covered with leaves and grass so much that animals",

          "Too big to walk for children and the tram/bus only stops at one spot. Tickets are slightly expensive, $18 adults and $11 for children. The zoo environment is too hot to walk in, and we went to the orangutans, they weren't their. In conclusion don't waste money on this zoo if you",
          "It is not hard to find if you are driving. We used GPS though. There are many taxi waiting at the car park area. So I guess transportation for foreign travelers is not a problem too. I paid RM32.00 which is cheaper compare to foreigner rate at RM5X exclusive of visit to panda.",
          "I feel sorry for the animals that live there, the place is so poorly taken care of, the animals look tired and miserable and it's overpriced. I've seen other small zoos that are much better for quarter of the price.",
          "The zoo was OK it was a lot of money for the entry but the zoo was good and i think i would go there again.",
          "After visitng some of the greates zoos in the world, we were positively surpirised of the great qualty of this zoo. If was nicely planned, clean and the animal quarters were quite big and seemed pleasant. It was exciting to see lions and tigers without fences or glass between us",
          "We went to the zoo today as we ate bug fans of cabybaras and my boy would like to see them up close. And we were in for a fantastic surprise! Zoo was very clean, well signed and many zoo keepers and helpers around to tell you where to go. We loved the big pond with many free",
          "Had a great time seeing animals that we don't see in Canada. Realized how big a giraffe really is! We got some great photos and learned about the animals. Great that the signs are also in English. Had to pay extra to enter the Panda paradise! We noticed that some new living",
          "It was a very good experience... I enjoyed big time!! :D there were lots of animals which you can see and enjoy. My favorite animals were PANDA and a very big and old monkey. I give high score for the animal quantity and the place quality ;)",
          "Lots of walking , decent amount of animals. However lack caf\u00e9s to eat at. Can spend at least half a day, it is out of the way though.",
          "I suppose is a nice zoo for all age in terms of education on flora and fauna (a bit fauna)..However, the heat kills the walk and limited choices of stalls which storm with a lot of people. Mozzie bites the entire walk. 1 time for good experience and saying \"hello\" to our",
          "Great place for families. good variety of animals and they all have pretty good enclosures. the pandas of course are a highlight but also we found the butterfly enclosure to be awesome to. A good fun day.",
          "As a Sri Lankan there was a time when we were proud of our zoological gardens. It was if not one of the best but the best in South Asia. However the splendour of it is no more there. Hence the Malaysian Zoo was a welcome relief. Well maintained; animals are well looked after",
          "great place to spend the day and just have fun, very clean... worth the visit. but it's a very big place be prepared for a good long walk.",
          "Greetings, I have visited a few nature parks and zoo in the past but Zoo negara was my first time visit. We were all gravely dissapointed. The tickets were too expensive and charging extra for panda just over the top! There was too much hype about the panda and the actual",
          "Zoo Negara is a little bit run down, but it is great to see that they have built new enclosures and are trying to refurbish some of the exhibits. There is a brand new Panda Conservatorium, but that's an extra $22 for an adult. There are two multi-animal shows every day where",
          "This is a great place to spend the day if you love animals. The zoo is about 45 mins from the city center and we took a meter taxi. If you are likely to stay only for a short while then you could request the taxi to wait and take you back. Otherwise you could get meter taxi as",
          "The zoo is a short trip outside central area of the city just past batu. I recommend taking a cab, it's not that expensive. As always, negotiate a price before going. Make sure to bring sunscreen and water. The exhibits are...not terrible. Some were really sad, old and in need",
          "Every time when I visit any zoo I feel sorry for animals but this zoo is the exception to the rule, it's so huge and beautiful, very green and spacious for animals, it's park and zoo same time, I was impressed, it's worth seeing place",
          "its quite a big zoo and the kids enjoyed the day out. you get to see the white tigers. there is a butterfly park also",
          "A rather relaxed zoo with some monkeys on the loose pillaging the trash bins. Big spaces for the animals and overall tidy. Nasty bathroom facilities and very strangely all the dining options are located just next to the large toilet houses which makes it impossible to have a",
          "Negara Zoo needs alot of work to call it a ZOO or a place to host animals.. the only good place in that palace is the panda building which requires additional fees to enter the panda place but all others are very small, dirty & smell like ****. yet the animals are in excellent",
          "Took my son for his 3rd birthday outing to Zoo Negara today as he wanted to see the Pandas Fees gone up but you can get 10% discount with a variety of cards like AEON etc. BTW, pandas is an extra RM20 per adult Most of the enclosure were either too old or not kept properly.",
          "The experience at Zoo Negara was one of the best i had in a long time. visiting the place with my wife kids and parents it was just too breath-taking. They have a baggi service which gets you around the zoo showing the animals and then drops you off at a point from where you",
          "A morning well spent. The zoo has undergone some massive upgrades and looks very clean and spacious. You'll be in very close proximity with the animals, feels like a walk in a wild safari park. The panda exhibit is a new attraction and is quite interesting. The only nuisance is",
          "My first time going to zoo negara, first impressions, the zoo is huge, and you will get tired walking the whole round, even worst when the weather is hot! Some of the animals look bad though, either old or underfed (camels,cattle).",
          "Malaysia Zoo, also called National Zoo is run by the Malaysian Zoological Society and is a bit outside Kuala Lumpur.It has more than 400 Species of Mammals. It is a bit away from Kuala Lumpur, so you have to take the Rapid Kl LRT to the Wandsa Maju Station .Outside the Station",
          "I was made to learn that the zoo have undergone some major upgrades and still more to come, as part of their vision to meet the minimum standard as a world class zoo. In this part of the world i feel that Zoo Negara is among the best in the region. It came a long way and have",
          "The zoo seem to has undergone lots of upgrade, especially the areas the patrons walks. However the the area where the animals are such as its cage are poorly maintained. The animals seem to be poorly taken care. Requires improvement. Nevertheless, kids will enjoy this place.",
          "I had high expectations for this zoo, already having done months of research and finding out extra background info. They are constantly changing, and moving forward! Just a few years ago the elephants were performing and giving rides. Now those elephants are living life in a",
          "After reading reviews here, I was prepared for disappointment but the zoo visit was great! We got there early at opening time before it got too hot and busy and spent at least 4 hours there. Definitely worth paying extra to see the pandas if you haven't before. We did get a bit",
          "Well basically we came here with no expectations at all as we are not too sure what is to be expected in the zoo. For starters, as a local, the price to enter the zoo with the panda viewing session included would cost a high of RM54! The price would be even higher for tourists!",
          "If you plan to go, you should get there early in the morning so it will not pack with car trying to find parking and the que for ticked will not be that long. Other than that, the zoo still best zoo in malaysia. A lot of thing has change, my son really enjoyed there. Even I",
          "I was in KL with the family for the school holidays and one of the places I brought them is the Zoo Negara Kuala Lumpur. Although the entrance fees are quite fair, when we went in, we didn't expect the area to be really huge. For those who does not like to walk, you can take",
          "It is a good experience to visit animals specially two pandas from china. For visiting panda you should pay 30 RM. Go there early in the morning because the zoo closes at 4:30 p.m and if you go there may be run out of time to see all the animals. The interesting part was that",
          "1. My perspective; I, (a 70 year old world traveler and visitor of many zoos), a 45 year old male friend, and his 11 year old son visited the zoo on March 17/15. We visited mostly for the pleasure of the young boy, expecting him to see the flora and fauna of Malaysia and",
          "My fiance and my family decided to take a trip to the Zoo. When we arrived we paid to enter the zoo. There are variety of animals, like; monkeys, pony, giraffe, penguin, tortoise, birds, lions, cheetah, panda. We get the chance to see when they were feeding the panda. But it was",
          "this place very fantastic for young children, but because of bigness kids become so tired! this place is very warm and humid!",
          "The rating is high from me because we must appreciate the effort but some guidelines can be done for improving if the zoo management reads these sentences. 1) Too many staff for the buying ticket area( not clear about details) but less staff to clean the animals and area",
          "Something that you would not expect from a Zoo. If you a Local the cost is RM30.00 where else if you are a Tourist it would be RM50.00. We were there with my Girlfriend Niece and nephew. It\u2019s a mix feeling of being happy and sad. Not all animals were happy either, certain parts",
          "I have very conflicting feeling about this place. The zoo is big but not a lot variety of animals. While some may see the zoo as poorly maintained, It remain as rustic as possible due to lots of naturally grown trees and plants (meaning not beautifully manmade kind of",
          "Visted the Zoo Negara with family in September 2014.Very big place with lot of animals.Long que to see the Panda which is frustrating.Some enclosures like the monkeys are not well maintained.The Animal show at the amphitheatre was a low affair with few animals.Also the entrance",
          "It is a place that I would definitely recommend if you are visiting KL. The zoo is indeed very big with different animals. Also, its clean and spacious. For photo shooting lovers, that is the place to go. There are food outlets in different corners. Muslims will have access to",
          "Most of the animals or landscape is not well maintained. The aquarium water is cloudy and their glass is not clear. Kinda sad to see the animals are not well groomed.",
          "Good and Educational place for young children to visit. Wide Range of Animals to see. From Giraffe to Rhinosaur to Tigers to Elephants to Apes to Penguins to Aviary Sections to Reptile House to Aquariums. Panda Center was nice and cozy but very disappointed to see them",
          "Zoo has improved since our last visit in 2008. More attraction I would say but they can improve more if they have sufficient fund. People would say the entrance fees is expensive but bare in mind that the fees that we paid goes to the animal food & maintenance, staff salary,",
          "The last time I visited the zoo was year 2000. 14 years past, and I brought my 8 kids to the Zoo, hoping to see something new or refreshing. To my disappointment, the zoo was still the same like 14 years back, and the aquarium and penguins were the worst! Very dirty, ill",
          "What I like: - Panda zone is cozy, quiet and clean. - Wide range of animals What I dislike: - Food: Limited choice, expensive, and terrible (instant noodle taste better) - Facilities: Not convenient for strollers and wheelchairs, toilet is not really clean.",
          "Let us share with you our experience.We took a cab from KL city which was about a 30 min ride.When we arrived,the ticketing was easy and the ticket rates were fair at 75 ringgit for an adult and child.The place was not crowded as it was a weekday.Our first impression of the",
          "It's kind of frustrating to see how this place deteriorating. The living in there need more to survive too. It does frustrates my son too as he was expecting to see more animals but not much to watch. Please do something to this place.",
          "We went to berjaya hills and it was terrible too , and after that we went to the zoo . Trust me ... if you go to berjaya hills or zoo , you waste your time and money . The Singapore zoo was great but this one was really bad .",
          "Today after 3 years I decide to visit the Zoo Negara and hope to see New Things and Status of the Animals..After reaching the Zoo, it was Saturday the Front Entrance was packed and I have to use Entrance B about 500 meter, Car Park was half full. Tickets were purchase a",
          "This is the second time I have visited this zoo in the last 5 years. The purpose of this visit was primarily to see the 2 Pandas. RM80 for non Malaysian RM50 for locals, this dose include the entrance fee into the Pandas. This zoo is much improved from the first time I visited",
          "I think its one of the most amazing zoo i ever been to Its not like they try to build a zoo to look like a jungle, but all what they did is to put animals in the cages inside a real jungle, and thats what i loved about it U will feel like refreshing the minute u enter there A",
          "My (young) kids really enjoyed it here but personally I felt there was too much works in progress with empty enclosures. If it wasnt for the pandas the rating would have been much lower, they saved the whole visit for me. It was all about money here, you had to pay for a map of",
          "We have been visiting this zoo several times over the years, and it has always been ended with a comment 'they can better'. However, since all the renovation works, this place has improved termendously. Added to that is the world class Panda conservation facility. This place is",
          "Sweet little zoo with rhinos, giraffes, a butterfly park.. But the best is to go see the 2 pandas on loan from the Chinese government. At 2.30 each afternoon they wake them up to feed them, we were lucky to be there then to see them awake, they sleep all day",
          "Well-maintained. There shouldn't have been extra charges for the train/tram rides though. The animal show was spectacular. Bravo!",
          "Visited the Zoo with family. Nice place to take the kids out on a weekend. got to see Bears, Giraffes, Tapir, White tigers, Bengal tigers, lions, camels, orang-utan and the chimpanzee, and of course the Pandas. There were many more animals ....too long to list. The enclosures",
          "We arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon and were charged 2x what the locals pay to enter the zoo. The 3 species of bears, zebras, orang-utans, chimpanzees, rhino, elephant, and many of the reptiles were nowhere to be seen - empty enclosures with no explanation. Very disappointing",
          "its a great zoo but not what i expected. the animals condition are not bad but for some the habitat it's a bit small. and i think for some the weather is hard to bear.",
          "I liked it when I visited back in 2011, & had planned to visit again if I ever wanted a relaxing morning somewhere within KL. And that morning came last weekend. We spend about two hours there altogether, but I would suggest to allocate more time if you wanna go for the show &",
          "After reading mixed reviews, we thought we would still go and make our own opinion of it, and I am glad to say we were presently surprised. It wasn\u2019t a big zoo, and it was laid out quite nicely and was easy enough to walk around. We chose not to pay the extra to see the Pandas.",
          "On arrival, I queued to purchase the tickets. As I made my way to the ticketing counter, the cashier asked me for a piece of paper which she claim that I must place my order before I can make my ticket payment. I decided not to make a fuss and walked back to the start of the",
          "It's not a bad zoo, however, I haven't seen anything so special about it to make me tolerate the heat and humidity. Maybe the giant pandas would make it a bit more interesting as I visited the zoo 2 weeks before the arrival of the pandas.",
          "I was here for my company's Family Day... it was more than 15 years ago when I came here. There are some things that did not changed...such as the sanctuary for the monkeys. They did add additional areas...actually a nice place to bring your family with young children. But if",

          "Its a good zoo but I wouldn't say great! Some enclosures are yet to be desired for the animals and I think could be enlarged esp the Hippos, elephants, giraffes etc. The map is not quite detailed as it should. Its a little on the grotty side and while they are building new",
          "My wife missed out on a visit to Kuala Lumpur's Zoo Negra (National Zoo) when she fell ill on our last trip, so when I planned this trip I made sure we had time to visit, we had high expectations for Zoo Negra. The first shock was around the entrance there was a great big trench",
          "Being guilty of contempt of many attractions local, we visited with extremely low expectations, and I would recommend the same mental prep for anyone planning a visit. What surprised us pleasantly: (1) the animals looked fairly well cared for & well fed, and (2) the 4 young",
          "If you trully loved animal you don't go to this zoo, the cage looked all cramped and the animal seem very sad and unhappy, they give me this feeling of being neglected... most of them are caged so you don't get to interract with animal and the like, there aren't that many to see",
          "It's quite clear to see this place needs some TLC, especially at the eye-watering 50RM fee for non-Malays to enter (you also have to pay with cash). Although it had a good variety of animals, it was fairly unkempt, lots of construction work going on (with no warning) and some",
          "Visited today the Zoo with my wife. Not very well maintained and needs to take care of facilities and animals. Very limited number of animals without any guide brochure. Only two shows a day; if missed nothing you can do. Food facilities are poor. Very disappointed. Much below",
          "Was on a working trip for around 10 days in Zoo Negara recently. Took the opportunity to stroll around and have a look at the Zoo Negara. The Zoo negara is situated at Hulu Kelang, quite far away from the city center. Taxis served as a convenient mode of transport. The Zoo",
          "The Location was quiet far from the city (times square) but it was worth visiting. The Zoo closes at 5:00 pm and have a show everyday at 3pm and on fridays at 3:30pm. It would take you maximum 2 hours to complete the entire zoo.",
          "Charging at Rm30 and a whopping RM50 (adult) RM20(Children) for foreigners!!The zoo is dirty, unkempt and many major constructions going on here. Failed to post any notice of ongoing constructions on their website. Toilets are so dirty and it reeked. I implore you not to waste",
          "The first time i visited this zoo was about 10 years back. The overall impression was quite good, with cheap entrace fee. But when i visited this zoo again in Aug 2013, i was quite shocked with the price hike in entrance fee (RM30 for adult), and yet the map was not included. I",
          "I thought after the price hike in entrance fee some refurbishment could be done to the zoo. Yet, the place still stinks, water in ponds and aquarium are still clear as mud, animals getting older and move slower. Not to mention the animal performance where hundreds are gathered",
          "Visiting the National Zoo was a waste of time and money. They say they have more than 700 species living there but we hardly saw anything other than the main icons such as the elephants, giraffes, lion and monkeys. The seal show is a failure not interesting. I would not",
          "What can I really say about Zoo Negara? One word comes to mind \u201cdilapidated\u201d. My family and I visited this zoo during our trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and were more than a little disappointed at the state of this zoo, and it left us questioning the actual care of the animals",
          "Visited on first day of Raya. Entrance fees RM 30 for adult but not inclusive of map (RM 1) & train ride. Everthing seems to be expensive even ice cream are selling at RM 6.00 per scoop. The show are not great and boring. Will not be returning unless there is new attraction but",

          "We went on the run up to Hari Raya and so it was very quiet with no queues for anything and less than 100 people in total visiting, I suspect. The zoo is going through a period of building and refurbishment so the bears couldn't be viewed, several paths/roadways dead ended (no",
          "I have visited this park on september 2012, It was raining and the weather was very fine The zoo is full of interesting items especially the elephants and me and my kids fed them by hand the park is wide and well constructed and you see hundreds of animals and birds, some area",
          "Looked forward to this visit with the family now for some time. Was very disappointed with the out-come. Animals tired, listless, and especially the lions and tigers which were in very poor underweight condition and in urgent need of a drench and worming. Enclosures in sad state",
          "I went here with my family a few years ago. This is a place children will enjoy. There is a time schedule for the performing seals ( I hope it is still going on ). That is something I too enjoyed. There are many kinds of animals and birds as any zoo will have. Frankly, I was",
          "I am staying in KL for many months but just knew about the volunteer program at zoo Negara. My friend and I did apply for half day volunteer. It was a great experience. For those who moaning about cleanliness, being a zoo keeper is a hard work. I was appointed for savannah",
          "i like this zoo,its look like quiet clean.so far so good animals was happy looking. we walk there for a 2 hours or so. but i would like to see more animals in such big areas of zoo,actually they had any kind of animals but still would like to see some more.",

          "I'm deeply sadden to say this as a Malaysian. The national zoo is in a poor and sorry state. The price you have to pay for the entrance ticket does not reflect in the services you get within the zoo compound. The parking rate is also absurd. Most animal enclosures were not well",
          "Its not really rich of animals but I liked the shows they are making and I like the idea of the monkey island, I didn't like the ticket pricing, you pay about the same price of the rest of the zoo ticket for a small car ride.",
          "Everything out from entrance till the internal zone. Service staff: OUT Cleanliness: OUT Toilets: OUT Animals: PITYING (Could have been so so so much better) If the animals have a choice, i guess they wouldn't want to survive in there. That's why majority of the animals in there",
          "I am a proud Malaysia but I have to say the Zoo Negara really has a lot of improvement to do. This was only my second visit, the first time being when I was only in Standard 2 for a class trip. Now I am a working adult 16 years later. Nothing has changed or might have worsened.",
          "It's been about 6 years since our last visit to Zoo Negara, and we had hoped that things had improved - yes, they are better, but we still have a long way to go. The animals are in much better enclosures than they used to be - I still remind visits during my childhood (decades",
          "We live in KL and last visited this zoo in 2011. I'm sorry to say that it appears to have gone downhill. There actually seemed to be far fewer animals this time around. I can remember the ape enclosure being full last time ; With many apes and even one throwing peanut shells",

          "As a national zoo, much more could be done to showcase the flora and animal kingdom unique to Malaysian forests. While it no longer caged up the animals (except for monkeys and birds), animals are dozing off almost the entire day. Lack of educational tour and signages to",

          "Not worth the money. Zoo uses different prices for malays (30rm) and foreigners (50rm). Show was boring and over-all experience was very bad. With the same price you can see much better zoos in other countries."

There are other shows in the zoo as well. All of this information can be found in the information booklet the zoo authorities provide while collecting your ticket.",

          "23 Dec 2019. Visited the zoo with my lovely wife and her friend. First time in my life time visiting this place as we like to see the panda, they are so adorable. Unfortunately heavy rain spoiled our visit and we stucked due to small flood. What a memorable day in my life.",
          "Okay only because:\n1. Ample parking space for visitors. \n2. We went solely to see the pandas. \n3. Other key attractions - tigers, orangutans, amphitheatre show, savannah \n4. Good for group outings, and you can spend the whole day there. \u2026",
          "I enjoyed the experience exploring the zoo. Animals are well taken care of, also Panda is definitely a must visit. Price wise, i think it's fair, its not easy to maintain such big area. Must visit place  for the kids.",

          "Ok.zoo, it's big with over 3 places for Tapir. But most places are too small for animals. Panda center, tiger and Lion the are recommended, the rest is too tiny. Most animals were to tired of life. The show was long and boring. Go to restroom before entry, inside toilets haven't beep cleaned since 80s or 90s.",
          "Huge fish and panda is just sleeping.",
          "Great place to spend the weekend. Need more tourist to support. Bathrooms need more western communal with better facilities. Kudos to them for maintaining it after more that 40 years",
          "Not worth a visit with the current ticket prices and parking fees. All facilities and surrounding require major maintenances. Tram should be free, some cages have solid doors that block visitor's view, no water in toilets, long grass in cages, insufficient lighting in aquarium etc..",
          "Too sad to see the place. Not well maintained.  The animal show mostly the bird's show, plus if you want to touch the bird (actually the bird Just landing for a while at your hand, need to pay RM10 as donation). Went inside the butterfly \u2026",

          "Generally Poorly maintained, aging and some structures are is poor condition, exhibits and enclosures need upgrades and more up to date design. Federal government needs to fund and assist Zoo.",
          "Since the Pandas came in there has been lots of improvement at the zoo... brings back a lot of memories and I think the specimens at the zoo are better now especially mammals. It's great for family with kids, bring the kids there to learn \u2026",
          "An older style zoo with the usual range of animals.  With panda's as the highlight.  Not so easy to get to via public transport, but still well worth the effort.  Different entry pricing depending on what country you are from.",
          "The zoo is spacious. I visited it last year in April and granted free entrance since it's my bday month. Overall, the animals were looking great. Encouraged to bring umbrella along as the weather is hot and sunny. Quite enjoying to come here with a bunch of friends.",
          "V good place , need to avail the maps more",
          "What can I say? Unless you're an absolute avid lover of animals, the zoo isn't exactly where I will spend my weekends at. You'll have more luck at other zoos, such as the Taiping Night Safari.",
          "It was a family trip on weekday afternoon during school holiday. Parked at Parking C which requires some walking towards the entrance but not too bad.\n\nTicketing counter staff was fast though no smily, could be a tiring day as it is holiday \u2026",

          "As a Malaysian i feel ashamed. This is my 2nd visit after 5-6 years and the cage/habitat condition just getting worst. I don't mind paying RM45 for the entry but it's like the money is not properly utilized. I think it is better to close for 1-2 year to renovate the whole zoo.",
          "Lots of animals I haven't seen before, definitely worth visiting. It does cost extra for tourists compared to locals though...",
          "Was doing project on Zoo Negara when i was in secondary school in year 1998. Had another visit in year 2001. And fast forward today - less than 45 days to year 2020 - sadly after many2 years the state of Zoo Negara did not rise instead \u2026",
          "Fun day at the zoo for our family. The zoo is well-kept although the smell at some places are a little unbearable (but then again, we're at a zoo!). The prices have gone up quite a bit since I came here as a kid, now at RM44 for Malaysians and RM88 for international visitors. My highlight was the panda conservation centre.",

          "I grew up beside the Zoo. And my kids love animals. So hence this Zoo has a special place in our hearts. I take the kids a few times a year....not too much dont want them to get bored.",
          "Hopefully the monkeys area can have some maintenance. At least keep 2-3 in a cage. So that they can play together not staying in a prison ALONE. Went there just now. Some of they looks stress and alone. Suggest to let visitors to pampers \u2026",
          "Good place for spend time with children. Take about 4hours to complete by walking including animal show about 40mins. At noon animal not active. Bring along stroller & umbrella yaaaa.",

          "Seems like Animals needs more cares...\nMost of the Animals are very Lean, places around animals are very dirty.\n\nVery limited Food stalls and Food quality worst but cost are more expensive then Popular foods such as KFC, MC, Pizza.",
          "A nice zoo with many local animals like Malayan tigers and orang utan. Giant Panda conservatory is another reason to visit the zoo. Needs a lot of upgrading but still a pleasant zoo experience.",
          "I was at the zoo yesterday. To my opinion, the zoo is in really bad conditions. Some of the cages are not being maintained properly and some animal seems to be in bad health. Honestly, why bother having zoo? We literally suffering all the \u2026",

          "Zoo is nice. Covers all in all different animals. A little bit expensive though - RM 82 for foreigners.",
          "Many structures/buildings inside are not well maintained and run down, except the panda building. Animal show is entertaining but sound system not good.",
          "I wish they do a better job in taking care of the animals. Overall, had fun here.",
          "A good zoo, animals are not very far from each other which means less walking and quick trip to cover all.",
          "This Zoo Negara is the best zoo in Malaysia. It have been well maintain, being among the oldest zoo in the world, as it can appear pretty much seasoned. But the excitement is there, and panda too. Hence the happy looking aminals in their encage. Stuff is helpful in every way possible.",
          "They have upgraded it quite well and more upgrades are being done, so the believe of everyone thinking zoo negara is not good is a myth. Visit it yourself to judge. The animals are all healthy and well taken care off. We enjoyed our time there",
          "Brought my 3 years old daughter to the Zoo Negara for the first time. She and I enjoyed half a day being there before she was too exhausted and dozed off. I had to carry her back to my car 15min away. We covered 70% in 3 to 4 hours. We took \u2026",

          "Most of the animals are skinny & seems to be in distress. The jaguar looks to be in pain. Penguin enclosure was terrible, so does a lot of other animals enclosure. Its like a horror show.

After taking photos, there will be a lot of staffs waiting and will encourage you to print your photo first before you can even take a tour of the zoo.

My kids enjoyed their time there, seeing face to face the animals that they usually only see in the books or tv.. if only there are certain animals that they allow to feed(wt food provided from d zoo, paid by us visitors, monitored by the staffs) for more fun & interesting activities for the kids..",

A shame but overall a great experience with the animals.",
          "Great place to bring kids learning about animals which we only get to see on TV nowadays. I highly encourage parents to go with their children. A lot of animals to see.

        "wiki": "The National Mosque of Malaysia (Malay: Masjid Negara Malaysia, \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0646\u0762\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0633\u064a\u0627) is a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It has a capacity for 15,000 people and is situated among 13 acres (53,000 m2) of gardens. The original structure was designed by a three-person team from the Public Works Department: UK architect Howard Ashley, and Malaysians Hisham Albakri and Baharuddin Kassim. The engineer in charge of the construction of the mosque, which commenced in 1963 was Antony Morris. It was built on the site of a church, the Venning Road Brethren Gospel Hall, which had stood there since 1922 but was appropriated by the Malaysian government. The mosque is a bold and modern approach in reinforced concrete, symbolic of the aspirations of a then newly independent Malaysia.\nIts key features are a 73-metre-high (240 ft) minaret and a 16-pointed star concrete main roof. The umbrella, synonymous with the tropics, is featured conspicuously \u2013 the main roof is reminiscent of an open umbrella, the minaret's cap a folded one. The folded plates of the concrete main roof are a creative solution to achieving the larger spans required in the main gathering hall. Reflecting pools and fountains spread throughout the compound.\n\n\n== History ==\nMalaya gained its independence from the British government on 31 August 1957. Major development programs in areas of economy, social and architecture were actively implemented in line with the new government. The programs were also to portray new progressive culture and achieved democracy. Therefore, on 30 July 1957, in the meeting of the Federal Executive Council an idea to build a national mosque as a symbol of the country\u2019s independence was mooted. In another meeting on 5 March 1958, Chief Ministers of the eleven states in the Federation of Malaya, a proposal was made to name the mosque Masjid Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, in recognition of Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman's efforts in guiding the country to gaining independence. However, Tunku refused this honour; on the contrary he named it Masjid Negara in thanksgiving for the country\u2019s peaceful independence without bloodshed. On Friday, 27 August 1965, the mosque was declared open by the third Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the late Tuanku Syed Putra of Perlis. \nThe mosque underwent major renovations in 1987, and the once-pink concrete roof is now clad in green and blue tiles. Today, Masjid Negara continues to stand sleek and stylish against the Kuala Lumpur skyline. An underground passage leads to the National Mosque located near the railway station, along Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin. Its unique modern design embodies a contemporary expression of traditional Islamic art calligraphy and ornamentation. Near the mosque is the Makam Pahlawan (Heroes' Mausoleum), a burial ground of several Malaysian Muslim leaders. Makam Pahlawan is a 7-pointed star concrete roofed structure.\nOn 27 August 2015, Masjid Negara celebrated its Golden Jubilee (50th anniversary).\n\n\n== Imams of the National Mosque ==\nGhazali Abdullah (1965)\nMohs Salleh Hassan Farid\nSheikh Abdul Mohsein bin Salleh (1974-1975)\nAhmad Shahir bin Daud (1975-1980)\nAbu Hassan bin Din Al-Hafiz (1981-1983)\nAhmad Shahir bin Daud (1984-1992)\nArifin Harun (1992-1993)\nTaib Azamudden bin Md.

As the global city of Malaysia, it covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016. Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the Klang Valley, is an urban agglomeration of 7.25 million people as of 2017. It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.\nKuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Malaysian King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong), the Istana Negara. The city once held the headquarters of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government, but these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999. However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three federal territories of Malaysia, enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Towers, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysian development.\nKuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road system supported by an extensive range of public transport networks, such as mass rapid transit (MRT), light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, public buses, hop on & hop off buses (free of charge) and airport rail links. Kuala Lumpur is one of the leading cities in the world for tourism and shopping, being the 10th most-visited city in the world in 2017. The city houses three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls.Kuala Lumpur has been ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking at No. 70 in the world, and No. 2 in Southeast Asia after Singapore.  Kuala Lumpur was named as one of the New7Wonders Cities, and has been named as World Book Capital 2020 by UNESCO.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nKuala Lumpur means \"muddy confluence\" in Malay; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means \"mud\". One suggestion is that it was named after Sungai Lumpur (\"muddy river\"); it was recorded in the 1820s that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River. Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak as the point where one river joins a larger one or the sea is its kuala. It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur in fact extended down to the confluence (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), although Sungai Lumpur is said to be another river joining the Klang River a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence, or perhaps located to the north of the Batu Caves area.It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (\"muddy landing place\") in the same way that Klang was once called Pengkalan Batu (\"stone landing place\"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur. Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIt is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang (Klang River) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut, raised funds from Malaccan Chinese businessmen to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines.\n\nAlthough the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from these mines was exported in 1859. At that time Sutan Puasa was already trading near Ampang, two traders from Lukut, Hiu Siew and Yap Ah Sze, then arrived in Kuala Lumpur where they set up shops to sell provisions to miners in exchange for tin. The town, spurred on by tin-mining, started to develop centred on Old Market Square (Medan Pasar), with roads radiating out towards Ampang as well as Pudu and Batu (the destinations became the names of these roads) where miners also started to settled in, and Petaling and Damansara. The miners formed gangs among themselves; and fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, particularly between factions of Kuala Lumpur and Kanching, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew the early Chinese trader was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, was appointed in 1868.Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include Haji Mohamed Tahir who became the Dato Dagang (\"chief of traders\"). The Minangkabaus from Sumatra became another important group of peoples who traded and established tobacco plantations in the area. Notable Minangkabaus include their headman Dato' Sati, Utsman Abdullah, and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru. The Minangkabaus were also significant socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.\n\n\n=== Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur ===\n\nEarly Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems \u2013 the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang. The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy. Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban centre.\n\nThe early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River \u2013 the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarters was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897.Frank Swettenham, on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated in 1884 that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the \"five-foot ways\" as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court. With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest.\n\nA railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.\n\n\n=== 20th century\u2013present ===\n\nThe area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2, and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory.The development of rubber industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based elsewhere also found a presence here.\n\nDuring World War II, Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage during the course of the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishir\u014d Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.The first municipal election in Kuala Lumpur was held on 16 February 1952. An ad hoc alliance between the Malay UMNO and Chinese MCA party candidates won a majority of the seats contested, and their success led to the formation of the Alliance Party (later the Barisan Nasional). On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. The British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang on the midnight of 30 August 1957, and in the morning of 31 August, the ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963.\n\nKuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.\nKuala Lumpur achieved city status on 1 February 1972, becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a federal territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function, and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, major urban developments in the Klang Valley have resulted in an extended Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. This area, known as Greater Kuala Lumpur, extends from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur westward to Port Klang, east to the edge of the Titiwangsa Mountains as well as to the north and south. The area covers other administratively separate towns and cities such as Klang, Shah Alam, Putrajaya and others, and it is served by the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. Notable projects undertaken within Kuala Lumpur itself include the development of a new Kuala Lumpur City Centre around Jalan Ampang and the Petronas Towers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley. The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to \"muddy confluence\" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers.\n\nLocated in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was a territory of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location within the most developed state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi), with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft).\n\n\n=== Climate and weather ===\nProtected by the Titiwangsa Range in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur is safe from strong winds and has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 35 \u00b0C (90 and 95 \u00b0F) and sometimes hit 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 \u00b0C (74.1 and 76.3 \u00b0F) and have never fallen below 17.8 \u00b0C (64.0 \u00b0F). Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month.\nFlood is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur after heavy downpours, especially in the city centre, because the structural irrigation lags behind the intensive development within the city. Smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nKuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan, who has been in office since 18 July 2015.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia. It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur's eleven districts, with estimated population and percentage of the total, serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall authority.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nKuala Lumpur is home to the Parliament of Malaysia. The hierarchy of authority in Malaysia, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, has stipulated the three branches, of the Malaysian government as consisting of the Executive, Judiciary and Legislative branches. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House / House of Senate) and Dewan Rakyat (Lower House / House of Representatives).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya, certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia (National Bank of Malaysia), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city.The city remains as the economic and business hub in the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city, and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang, the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.\nBursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. By 2015, the GDP has reached RM160,388 million, representing 15.1% of the total GDP of Malaysia. The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 was RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent, and RM94,722 in 2015. Average monthly household income is RM9,073 (~$2,200) as of 2016, growing at a pace of approximately 6% a year. The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the country's largest companies have their headquarters here, and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas, there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur.Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists.\nThere has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions\u2014 has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000 sq m-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.\n\nThe major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the PETRONAS Twin Towers, the Bukit Bintang shopping district, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, Petaling Street (Chinatown), the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the National Palace (Istana Negara), the National Museum, Islamic Arts Museum, Central Market, KL Bird Park, Aquaria KLCC, the National Monument, and religious sites such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Jamek Mosque, Thean Hou Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfield. Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor.The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing  Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. Trendy nightclubs, bars and lounges, such as Marini's on 57, Skybar at Traders Hotel, the Beach Club, Espanda, the Hakka Republic Wine Bar & Restaurant, Hard Rock Cafe, the Luna Bar, Nuovo, Rum Jungle, No Black Tie, the Thai Club, Zion club, Zouk, and many others are located here.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nKuala Lumpur alone has 66 shopping malls and is the retail and fashion hub in Malaysia as well as Southeast Asia. Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (US$2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006.\n\nSuria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier upscale shopping destination due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers.\nApart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungei Wang Plaza and Quill City Mall. Changkat area of Bukit Bintang hosts various cafes, alfresco dining outlets and illegal activities. Bangsar district also has a few shopping complexes, including Bangsar Village, Bangsar Shopping Centre, and Mid Valley Megamall.\nApart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles, fabrics and handicrafts. The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street, is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences.Since 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event at the time is held three times a year \u2013 in March, May and December \u2013 during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia which being maintained until present with new mega sales.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.76 million in the city proper as of 2016. It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites. Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley metropolitan (covering Petaling Jaya, Klang, Subang Jaya, Puchong, Shah Alam, Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.25 million as of 2017.Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians, as well as Kadazans, Ibans and other indigenous races from around Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Historical demographics ===\n\nHistorically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a \"purely Chinese village\", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war). The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2\u2013300, many of whom then brought their families here. Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka \u5ba2\u5bb6\u4eba), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another perhaps more accurate estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. The rubber boom in the early 20th century lead to a further increase in population, from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into Malaysia, many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits.Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people \u2013 the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. On the other hand, the working age group of 15\u201359 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays, the Indian Muslim communities and a small number of Chinese Muslims. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity.As of 2010 Census, the population of Kuala Lumpur was 46.4% Muslim, 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu, 5.8% Christian, 1.4% of unknown affiliations, 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 0.6% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious.\nKuala Lumpur is one of the three states where less than 50% of the population are self-identified Muslims, the other two being Penang and Sarawak.\nStatistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 87.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (7.9%), Chinese folk religions (2.7%) and Muslims (0.6%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (81.1%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Christians (7.8%), Muslims (4.9%) and Buddhists (2.1%). The non-Malay bumiputera community are predominantly Christians (44.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (31.2%) and Buddhists (13.5%). All bumiputera Malays are Muslim; this is due to the criterion in the definition of a Malay in the Malaysian constitution that they should adhere to Islam.Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. Malaysian English is a variant widely used. It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken by minorities include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi, and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles \u2013 Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.\nIndependence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Telekom Tower, Maybank Tower, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world and the tallest buildings in the country. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe Lake Gardens, a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Parliament building is located close by, and Carcosa Seri Negara which was once the official residence of British colonial administration is also sited here. The park includes a Butterfly Park, Deer Park, Orchid Garden, Hibiscus Garden and the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, which is the world's largest aviary bird park. Other parks in the city include the ASEAN Sculpture Garden, KLCC Park, Titiwangsa Lake Gardens, Metropolitan Lake Gardens in Kepong, Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, Taman Tasik Permaisuri (Queen's Lake Gardens), Bukit Kiara Botanical Gardens, Equestrian Park and West Valley Park near TTDI, and Bukit Jalil International Park.\nThere are three forest reserves within the city namely the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve in the city centre, the oldest gazetted forest reserve in the country 10.52 ha or 26.0 acres, Bukit Sungai Putih Forest Reserve (7.41 ha or 18.3 acres) and Bukit Sungai Besi Forest Reserve (42.11 ha or 104.1 acres). Bukit Nanas, in the heart of the city centre, is one of the oldest virgin forests in the world within a city. These residual forest areas are home to a number of fauna species particularly monkeys, treeshrews, pygmy goats, budgerigars, squirrels and birds.\nThere is another park in the close vicinity to Kuala Lumpur i.e. Templer Park initiated and opened by Sir Gerald Templer in 1954 during the \"Emergency\" time.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAccording to government statistics, Kuala Lumpur has a literacy rate of 97.5% in 2000, the highest rate in any state or territory in Malaysia.\nIn Malaysia, Malay is the language of instruction for most subjects while English is a compulsory subject, but as of 2012, English is still the language of instruction for mathematics and the natural sciences for certain schools. Some schools provide Mandarin and Tamil as languages of instruction for certain subjects. Each level of education demands different skills of teaching and learning ability.Kuala Lumpur contains 13 tertiary education institutions, 79 high schools, 155 elementary schools and 136 kindergartens.Several institutions in the city are older than 100 years\u2014such as Bukit Bintang Girls' School (1893\u20132000, relocated to Taman Shamelin Perkasa in Cheras and renamed GIS Garden International school Seri Bintang Utara), the Victoria Institution (1893); Methodist Girls' School (1896); Methodist Boys' School (1897); Convent Bukit Nanas (1899), St. John's Institution (1904), Confucian Private Secondary School (1906), Kuen Cheng High School (1908), Tsun Jin High School (1913) and Maxwell School (1917).\n\nKuala Lumpur is home to the University of Malaya (UM). Established in 1949, it is the oldest university in Malaysia, and one of the oldest in the region. It was ranked the best university in Malaysia, the 22nd best in Asia, and 3rd in Southeast Asia in QS World University Rankings 2019. In recent years, the number of international students at University of Malaya has risen, as a result of increasing efforts made to attract more international students.Other universities located in Kuala Lumpur include Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TARUC), UCSI University (UCSI), Taylor's University (TULC), International Medical University (IMU), Open University Malaysia (OUM), Kuala Lumpur University (UniKL), Wawasan Open University (WOU), HELP University and the branch campus of the National University of Malaysia (UKM) and University of Technology Malaysia (UTM). The National Defence University of Malaysia is located at Sungai Besi Army Base, at the southern part of central Kuala Lumpur. It was established to be a major centre for military and defence technology studies. This institution covers studies in the field of army, navy, and air force.Greater Kuala Lumpur covers an even more extensive selection of universities including several international branches such as Monash University Malaysia Campus, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus and Xiamen University Malaysia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nKuala Lumpur is a hub for cultural activities and events in Malaysia. Among the centres is the National Museum, which is situated along the Mahameru Highway. Its collection comprises artefacts and paintings collected throughout the country. The Islamic Arts Museum, which houses more than seven thousand Islamic artefacts including rare exhibits as well as a library of Islamic art books, is the largest Islamic Arts collection in Southeast Asia. The museum's collection not only concentrate on works from the Middle East, but also includes work from elsewhere in Asia, such as China and Southeast Asia. Kuala Lumpur has a Craft Complex coupled with a museum that displays a variety of textile, ceramic, metal craft and weaved products. All the information of the production process are portrayed in diorama format complete with historical facts, technique and traditionally engineered equipment. Among the processes shown are pottery making, intricate wood carving, silver-smithing, weaving songket cloth, stamping batik patterns on cloth and boat making. Royal Selangor has an ultra modern visitor's centre, which allows tours to be conducted through its pewter museum, gallery and its factory. In its pewtersmithing workshop, \"The School of Hard Knocks\", participants are taught to create their own pewter dish using traditional tools and methods.\nThe premier performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall located underneath the Petronas Towers. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO), consisting of musicians from all over the world and features regular concerts, chamber concerts and traditional cultural performances. The Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPac) in Sentul West and Damansara Performing Arts Centre (DPac) in Damansara Perdana are two of the most established centres for performing arts, notably theatre, plays, music, and film screening in the country. It has housed many local productions and has been a supporter of local and regional independent performance artists.

Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.\n\nIn terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of city. The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres, an airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eight minutes and costs RM 55 (roughly US$13.50), while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal but from KLIA2 which is two kilometres from KLIA. KLIA2 is served by an extension of the KLIA Ekspres and by a free shuttle bus service from KLIA. As of 2018, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as Firefly and Malindo Air.Public transport in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the expansion of the rail network. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light rapid transit (LRT), monorail, commuter rail, mass rapid transit (MRT) and airport rail link. The LRT system has three lines, Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line and Sri Petaling Line, connecting many locations within the city and surrounding suburbs. The KL Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter and MRT connect the city centre with other suburbs and cities of the Klang Valley. The main railway hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the most of the rail lines. KL Sentral is also a hub for the intercity railway service KTM ETS, which travels from north to south Peninsular Malaysia through the city centre. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more railway lines due for completion or in the pipeline, such as the Putrajaya Line and Bandar Utama-Klang Line.\nThe largest public transport operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus, using Rapid KL brand name. Since the take over from Intrakota Komposit Sdn Bhd, Prasarana Malaysia has redrawn the entire bus network of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley metropolitan area to increase passenger numbers and improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The Prasarana Malaysia has adopted the hub and spoke system to provide greater connectivity, and cut down the need of more buses.In Kuala Lumpur, most taxis have distinctive white and red liveries. Kuala Lumpur is one of the major ASEAN city with taxis extensively running on natural gas. Taxis can be hailed from taxi stands or from the streets.

The port is the largest and busiest in the country handling about 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargo in 2006.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nKuala Lumpur is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Kuala Lumpur\nPutrajaya\nCyberjaya\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGullick, J.M.

So many amazing colours and patterns and",

          "Don't be put off by the external look of the place. Once inside you can appreciate the work that has gone into this attraction. The park-like setting is beautifully presented and the butterflies are many. Sit and relax to enjoy the butterflies (many) coming to rest on you.",
          "To be honest, walking around in a big atrium full of butterflies is only amusing for like 10 minutes. After that, you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen em all. They do have some really beautiful species and the garden is landscapes well. It seems to be maintained well and the butterflies",
          "It is a lush green park with lots of plant and greenery. i had expected more butterflies actually. it has quite an impressive insect museum with real speciments and live animals too. the wheelchair and stroller access is quite bad as visitors need to go down quite a steep",
          "I\u2019m not big on insects but I can honestly say I was mesmerised by these creatures. We Got some amazing photos of these animals - it\u2019s lovely how big this place is and how well maintained it is. There is a small museum at the end too.",
          "The whole thing is a maze of up and down pathways amongst jungle greenery and flowers (of course - for the butterflies) and would be nice enough to visit on its' own. There are quite a few vantage points to look over the scenery and places to sit and take a rest. Butterflies",
          "The butterfly park is quite large and well maintained, it's easy to walk around and see the different features. There are lots of different butterflies and good information boards explaining what the various types of butterflies are. There is also a section with fish and other",
          "Albeit a bit small, it is peaceful place to recluse from the hustle and bustle of a city. Refreshing to be in touch with nature amongst a good collection of a variety of butterflies flying in the freedom of the enclosure nicely supplemented with beautiful flowers and other",
          "I went here with my family late last year. As soon as you walk in, you are surrounded by butterflies of all shapes and sizes. Although the enclose is a bit humid, that is only what can be expected to keep the butterflies at how they should be optimally held. It can be for all",
          "A good place to see beautiful flowers and the lovely butterflies especially if you are looking for a quite pace.",
          "The park has many trees, plants and waterfalls providing a great backdrop for the butterflies that roam freely about you as you walk around",
          "Not sure how a previous reviewer can say the entrance fee is pricey when it\u2019s around \u00a35 per person. If you like butterflies then go visit. And there are loads to see. Just stroll around and there are feeding points where the butterflies will land. But during our visit they",
          "went with my 3 children. oldest is 10, youngest is 1 n half. cannot bring strolller as its not troller friendly. poor maintenance. we hardly see any butterfly at first but after strolling about 10 minutes then we noticed a few. but not as many as my oldest daughter hope for. we",
          "It is good to know that the Maylasian authorities continue to manage this park as part of the country's environmental perservation. Rather pricey entrance fee , but worth the money to help with upkeep.",
          "My wife and my girls (3, 5, 7 and 18 y old) loved it but myself and my boy 9 years old didn\u2019t enjoy it that much. I think the main reason I didn\u2019t like it because of the humid weather but it has a lot of butterflies and other insects. Good learning for kids science classes.",
          "I just try to go cause i thought that it will be different but it's a beautiful place but in not very good conditions, its better the Australian, I mean u can see the same butterflies free if u walk around green areas in Kuala Lumpur",
          "Well worth a visit to pass an hour. Amazing place with numerous areas to sit and watch the butterflies. Was rather busy with most people not realising that running around making noise does not attract the butterflies to stay still. Only 24RM to get in. Great selection of",
          "The butterfly garden was very nice. Lot of beautiful butterflies and other creatures (turtles, fish, etc). The design of the area is very nice with lots of pretty water features. We would have spent more time here except the heat was a bit overwhelming. Wish they had a few more",
          "Very good Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park But the weather of Malayisa which is humid And warm do help in staying longer We enjoy the the trip to the the park Fare is good ( 24) for adults each Having good time for photo shoot",
          "It's a small park with lot of butterflies flying around all over the park. There are artificial waterfalls as well to capture some nice photographs. At the exit, there is a room which has some insect species.",
          "We spent an hour here following the nearby birdpark. It was a pleasant and peaceful hour amd worth a look.",
          "too expensive for what you get. a great place to visit and see the butterflies - an enclosed area where you can wander at a slow and enjoyable pace to take in all the butterflies and wildlife.",
          "Great views, beautiful landscaping and butterflies. Plus the exhibition on the way out is very informative. It\u2019s a 9 min walk from the bird park, despite the cabs claiming it\u2019s a 25 minute walk, and the route from one to the other is very scenic, if you have time visit the",
          "We entered a beautiful garden with various species of flowers. There were ponds with koi and tortoises. My daughter enjoyed the mini waterfall that brought us some cool on a hot day. But there were very few butterflies around. Maybe it was too hot, or due to too many visitors.",
          "The place was really amazing if you are travelling with family , so many butterflies with amazing different colors really natural and pure greenery all around the place the walkway was really great with little waterfalls and alot of trees and plants must visit place with family.",
          "100% worth it. Absolutely spectacular seeing thousands and possibly millions of butterflies and of so many varieties!",
          "Must visit. Its a beautiful place with multiple species of butterflies. Lush greenery and there are ponds with fishes. Toilets need to be improved but otherwise worth visiting place.",
          "Visited this butterfly park in the month of September 2018. Lush green, curled narrow footpath surrounded by green plants and flowers, cool stream alongside with full of colourful fish. We enjoyed a good hours watching colourful butterfly fluttering around us. There are some",
          "Nice large walk-through enclosure with lots of butterflies flapping past you. Having said that could only identify maybe 10-12 different species, so whilst the walk around is nice gets a bit same-same. Towards the end there is a great little collection of insects, scorpions,",
          "Very nice to be there, they are held in captivity (closed in by a net) but all showed are lokaly types, from small till over 12 cm of wingspan, and at the exit, there is a small show of insects from the wild there, some alive, most pinned on a isectboard. But educational, almost",
          "if you are willing to stand still and wait, then some amazing butterflies will come close. The enclosure is not massive but has several differemt areas so plenty of space. there are also fish, frogs, turtles and insets to see (in cages/tanks).definitely worth an hour or 2",
          "Small park yet pack with butterfly. We spent good 2 hrs staying up close and taking photos of beautiful butterflies. my 6yo enjoyed the bugs at the gallery very very much",
          "This was a relatively small butterfly park, but really well set up and organised, with lovely little paths and a lot of water. The butterfly population was good, and varied. We saw many huge ones, and close enough to pose with! The entrance staff was really not super friendly",
          "Wasn\u2019t as grand as I expected it to be, the gardens itself was a bit of a letdown, kind of small and difficult to take nice pictures of the butterflies. There are some koi fish ponds with waterfalls and a turtle pond. Inside there is a nice display of all the different species",
          "Park is a task to get to if not taking a vehicle and using public transport is not easy. Using the Hop On Hop Off tour bus and getting off one stop before the Bird Park where most people are heading for is probably the easiest. You can easily do both parks in one day. When",
          "This place is a dump....rundown, dirty and neglected, but worst of all had virtually no butterflies despite claiming to have 5000 at any one time and 120 species!!! It's very small, you walk around it in under 10 minutes. The most interesting part is the display of beatles and",
          "I pay 23 myr but I think it's a beautiful place but i didn't see anything that I haven't see before on my trip, the building it's old and i personally think that the price doesn't justify it's really close to the bird place, the botanical garden and other attractions",
          "Visited Park in August 2018 and had fantastic time. Well maintained park with lots of beautiful butterflies.",
          "This was something I wanted to do and I'm glad we did. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. Before we went, we read another review which said if you'd been to another butterfly park elsewhere you didn't need to go here and I'd agree, but in my world, this was an hour well spent!",
          "You must go early before the heat of the day which makes the butterflies seek shade and shelter. If you're on the Hop-on-Hop-off bus then it stops here, otherwise a brisk walk from KL Sentral or the Pasar Seni Bus Hub will get you there easily enough",
          "Just 10 min walk from the bird park. Easy to get around with lots of different kinds of butterflies. Do settle on you so some good photo shots. Best to go to feeding stations to see them up really close",
          "It was more of an interest based visit as we wanted to see the butterflies and how they are reared in a park. It was a nice experience to see beautiful colorful butterflies all around, their artificially made natural habitat, the feeding mechanisms and the way the park is",
          "I think butterflies are cool, so I really enjoyed this park. We paid 24 ringgit each, so around $12 US total. And bring your ringgit as tickets are cash only. The Park was only a 15-minute walk from our hotel (Hotel Majestic). The grounds are well laid-out with paths, koi",
          "Lots and lots of exotic butterflies of all shapes and sizes. Wonderful to see and have them land on you however very hot and humid.",
          "We were there with two kids. It was their first experience to see the beautiful butterflies that close. Butterflies are everywhere surrounding visitors. They also have a shop were you can buy nice butterflies.",
          "A very peaceful and beautiful area to visit if you have the time. There were quite a few varieties of butterfly to see on the walk around the plants and ponds. Not buggy or disabled friendly. It's 24 per adult to enter. The information on the insects at the end was very",
          "NIce way to spend an hour or two. Especially like their little museum with the bugs display, although the snakes didn't look too happy in their sall enclosure. Entry was 24 ringgits per person and they do not accept cards.",
          "My son and I came here when we had a free morning. Grab Taxi was cheap. Nice to get away from the city centre of concrete and into the outskirts where there are trees, flowers, park like area. Saw lots of butterflies, at the end, there is also a big exhibition room with the",
          "Great, awesome, very cool. Don\u2019t bring the stroller. Some paths were sandy or wet. No food available when we went though it appeared to have a cafe at some point. The bathroom was surprisingly primitive! Use the toilet before your visit!",
          "Walked through this park when visiting the KL lake garden trail. As usual, feast for the eye along with other attractions such as the bird park, Parliament etc.",
          "Great place to understand the butterfly for the kids and interact with it. Nice cool place to kill some time for the young ones.",
          "It was so wonderful as we stepped in alot ot butterflies passed by us as they were welcoming us. The park is very good and alot of greenery and beautiful flowers and amazing butterflies. We made our way down and walked around seeing the butterflies chasing each other look so",
          "Kind of cool if you have the time and are in the area, but not an essential stop. The bug museum afterwards was my highlight.",
          "We visited on an over cast day which was great as it is actually pretty humid in the garden. The entry cost was 24 rm adult and 13 child. On entry into the garden we were in awe of how beautiful the gardens were. there were plenty of butterflies to see and we saw many different",
          "This experience was just amazing. The setting is just so beautiful, I could gave watched them for hours. It was like being in another world, so peaceful and relaxing. What a lot of hard work has gone into making such a lovely home for the butterflies.",
          "Its is very close to the KL Bird Park. It is a small butterfly park with lots of species. There is a small insects museum also within the premises and gives you good ample information. My kids loved this park. If you have seen butterfly parks anywhere in the world then you can",
          "It says no where on the website that you cannot see butterflies when it is raining! It appears on the website that this place is indoors but it\u2019s actually outdoors so they say. A total waste of time! I took a Grab here and there\u2019s Absolutely nothing to do because the butterflies",
          "This spot seems ideal for nature lovers and it is located in the green space within the city that occupies many such dedicated parks. A quite and calm area and a space to walk around and enjoy the beauty of creation.",
          "Right next to the Bird park, it is quite small and not that enjoyable to me, maybe because butterflies are difficult to be presented. Could have easily skipped it.",
          "So many different kind of butterflies and each one has a unique wings. The place is amazing and kinda unreal. You could easily spend an hour there gazing at all this surrounding beauty",
          "It not often that a KL attraction will run rings around it's Singaporean counterpart but this one does it in spades. To qualify, the Singapore counterpart in it's current state although in it's hay day it would have still come second. Haven't been through the Changi version so I",
          "It was relatively pricey for the entry fee (25 ringgit) as compared to other butterfly parks I have been to. The place is pretty run down, the fruits were left on a tray feeding balls of flies (not butterflies). I read some reviews about rude staffs, and I thought it may have",
          "Amazing surroundings with a vast collection of butterflies, moths and dragonflies. The Butterfly Park is quite small and we were finished within 45 minutes. There is a museum attached with taxidermy specimens. Unfortunately the displays are old fashioned and photographs are",
          "It's worth a visit to this Butterfly Park - plus the KL Bird Park and Orchid Park are also nearby - and entry fee is inexpensive - with many species of Butterflies being active in this garden. A very relaxing garden to explore with many pathways, mini waterfalls and ponds with",
          "Pretty little walk amongst the rainforest and the butterflies. Worth a visit for a short time. Only issue for us was the toilets being very smelly and dirty. Kids loved it. Definitely recommend buying the fish food as there are some impressive looking fish in the ponds!",
          "The garden is great to visit. Plenty of different butterflies flying around your head and feet. Can take pics easily from many of them landing and not scared of lens. Inside building an interesting insectarium to teach toddlers.",
          "I\u2019ve never been to a butterfly park before so I thought this was great. We got there closer to closing time and it worked out well as the butterflies were pretty active. After walking around outside, we then saw the different bugs and things on the inside (not my favorite",
          "Really needs some upgrade work as nets tatty not enough information regarding butterflies with limited species. It gets hot under the nets in a small area, which brings you to a grotty souvenir shop. There is more to do in KL and see, unfortunately sanding to see as could be so",
          "The butterflies did not disappoint. The setting was excellent and it was easy to see the butterflies close up, one even alighted on my hand. There are many different species, shapes, sizes and colours of butterflies. There are also some fish in the pools. The insect display that",
          "I really enjoyed this visit! There are so many butterflies just flapping around, it was really cool! There were some really vibrant butterflies. The park itself seems small but it has a lot of twists and turns that it took a while to go through. There are little feeding stations",
          "A beautifully set out maze of paths, bridges and steps. The humidity is off the charts, we came early in the morning and it was steaming hot. You can purchase koi food from the front desk, and make sure you do because there are some huge and beautiful hungry fish that you can",
          "The butterfly park is Okey, not that big. Beautiful and different butterflies. Nice to see but definitely not a must see place",
          "We stopped by for a visit and were underwhelmed by the park. The gardens are nice to walk through but the selection of butterfly\u2019s was limited.",
          "Gorgeous Eden of waterfalls, coy fish, flowers and butterflies. Nestled in the botanical gardens area, a MUST stop for sight seeing. So many beautiful and colourful butterflies in all shapes and sizes. Enjoyable for everyone! An hour is enough time, and from memory it was",
          "This is a fabulous place to visit, to sit quietly and watch the many beautiful butterflies silently fluttering by. Worth every penny of the entrance fee.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the Butterfly Park. It is nestled next to the Bird Park & Orchid/Hibiscus Park. If you take the Hop On/Hop Off KL bus there is a stop only 5 minutes away. The entrance fee at RM 25 was quite reasonable for a non Malaysian. The place itself is",
          "Nice place to visit for a peaceful hour in busy KL! One of the better butterfly parks in the region and for a good photograph backdrop!",
          "Me and my partner went to the butterfly park after we visited the bird park so was quite late in the day I would recommend going earlier when they are feeding, the enclosure was pretty nice inside but not as much butterfly\u2019s as we\u2019d hoped to see, the koi fish were probably the",
          "Better than expected. Quite a few butterflies around, and a lovely garden for them to fly in. Also an insect museum with lots of insects on display.",
          "The Butterfly Park is right next to the Bird Park so you can do both in the same day. It\u2019s a good place to take kids & they had some good exhibitions in there.",
          "Lots of beautiful butterflies, the staffs are friendly. The only annoying thing is the price, 25 RM for foreigner.",
          "Was a little skeptical going in judging from some of the reviews here, but was pleasantly surprised when I got there! It was an absolute treat, never seen so many butterflies at such close range before! The place was very beautiful and scenic just on its own as well, would love",
          "My friend and I visited here . Lovely place , well kept and the layout is really nice with little bridges , a small water full and seating areas . It\u2019s 25 ringette entrance fee, which is just under \u00a35. Just a bit of warning , It is very very humid in there! There are plinths",
          "The park is beautiful, but all the butterflies were up in the \u201croofnet\u201d trying to get out, so you don\u2019t see many in the park. Didn\u2019t look like they enjoyed being there, maybe some flowers would help. Dead butterflies on the pathway.",
          "The Butterfly park is small and in need of love. That much is true and with an injection of funds it could be so much better. However, if you travel the world expecting every attraction of similar nature to be exactly the same then stay home. We enjoyed the butterfly park. it",
          "There were so many butterflies! The park isn't very big but it has nice pathways, a couple of waterfalls, and lots of flowers and butterflies. It was so peaceful just walking around watching all of them.",
          "The Thai wife and I spent a few hours here one morning recently. There had been a thunderstorm the previous afternoon and persistent rain overnight and the morning was a little dull. This probably contributed to there being a little less butterflys than usual out and about but",
          "I enjoy the water feature more than the butterflies as there were not much to see. Just like the neighboring Orchid Park, this place is deteriorating in condition. Such a shame, is this what we are offering to tourist? We are better than this!",
          "Was disappointed in the park , there were more fish than butterflies . not wheelchair friendly at all , even when asking the staff if it was accessible . its not a bad thing if nothing else to see but its minimal",
          "Visited this today and was bitterly disappointed....it has so much potential but has been left to rundown...butterflies are very run of the mill...nothing spectacular. Paths very slimy in places and i nearly slipped a few times. Needing a paint and renovation badly. Having",
          "At 25MYR for an adult , it's really worth the price to relax amongst butterflies & the fish ponds there... But parents should supervise their kids as these are living things & not toys ...",
          "It is a very nice place top visit with all the butterflies flying around, it is indeed an experience not to miss in Kuala Lumpur. You should however make sure you come early in the morning, this is when the butterflies are active. What I do not like about the place is when we",
          "We were told this was somewhere to go if you like butterflies. Its not huge but worth the money, it has some placed to site and watch the butterflies. We saw some amazing species and took a number of photos which we are having commissioned into paintings.",
          "More than a park is a small garden. However is nice, you have just to be patient to take nice pictures because butterlies fly around most of the time. However if you go by taxi or uber is good to pass half day.",
          "I loved all the butterflies! My concern is that staff should do more to protect them from children who do not have enough parental oversight. We saw kids grabbing them and we saw lots of dead butterflies... more guidance and rules would be best. Respect for nature was lacking.",
          "The butterfly park was well worth the visit. Lots of butterflies to see, but also lots of fish for the kids to feed. You can purchase the food at the ticket counter.",
          "It offers a lot more experience than I had previously thought. Nice garden with nursery, fish pond and all other supplies for the program. But the most important thing is patience and being calm. In this case, you can see wonderful things.",
          "More than wonderful You can see multiple & different type of butterflies & fish in this place Many types of scorpions, snakes, butterflies and many other insects from many places all over the world Must see",
          "It was a good experience to see the butterflies \ud83e\udd8b, I and my dad really enjoyed, and I advice you to visit it. The price is a bit expensive. High humidity inside.",
          "My family and I enjoyed the Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park. It is great to see all that number of butterflies in such a wonderful place",
          "The area is very compact so you will see a number of beautiful butterflies very easily and quickly; dress for a hot day.",
          "We spent about 90 minutes here admiring the butterflies in a large enclosure that does a good job maintaining a nice place to care for and show the butterflies in a semi natural state. While the butterflies are not as beautiful as the Caribbean and South America they are very",
          "The Butterfly park is in the area close to both Bird park and Orchid garden, however, it has a bit older feel to it, and if you're afraid of insects it's not something that I would recomend for you.",
          "This is a must go to when in KL - the butterflies are so pretty and the environment they live in so beautful - its not big, but well worth a visit.",
          "The butterfly park is close to the KL bird park. It is a dense garden area with lots of butterflies flying around. The garden is nicely designed and also has a display stand with various flowers on display to attract the butterflies. There is a small insect and butterfly gallery",
          "spanning over 80,000 sq ft of landscaped garden with many butterflies, exotic plants, butterfly-host plants and ferns.there are Japanese koi fish, fresh water turtles, live insects and a museum with a large collection of butterflies and insects from around the world.",
          "A beautiful little corner, it's about half an hour to an hour to stroll through a beautiful garden surrounded by tropical butterflies. Curious what anyone would expect different really. We spent quality family time taking an interest in massive butterflies and surprisingly",
          "Cannot count the number of times I have visited this place as it is a peaceful getaway from the city and never that crowded. The entrance fee is reasonable with discounts for locals and those holding MM2H Social visas. It is humid and war inside so don't wear heavy clothing.",
          "Not worth planning a trip too but if you're in the neighborhood why not! The coolest part of the park was the end where you can see all the different species throughout the world as well as different and huge insects.",
          "Poor signage from Hop Off bus. No brochures or information given about park, I expected more. A bit of a liability as very difficult to get around - too many stairs - wouldn't be allowed these days to build like that. So much potential it's shame, as it was nice. Lots of",
          "A tropical garden full of exotic butterflies, very humid! Very interesting to see the insects in cases and on wall charts. Brilliant.",
          "The bird park has a walk in aviary which was neat . The variety of birds may be kind of let down as we didnt come across any rare or tough to see species but the bird park is worth a visit . Check out the bird show timings before you go.",
          "We have never seen anything like this in the world! Definitely worth the price of admission... we stayed for 90 minutes and could have even stayed longer. There are literally thousands of species of butterfly in every size, shape, and colour imaginable. Several played around in",
          "Didn't know that this butterfly park existed since 1994. I can say it is still well maintained but maybe there's a lot more room for improvement. Entrance fees for local was RM12 for adult and RM7 for childeren which is quite reasonable. Normal entrance fees would be RM25 for",
          "A nice park in the city of KL, that I would call a hidden gem. Amazing butterflies full of color are all over the place and they are happy to sit on you and feed on your sweat. Be very careful and watch your step as a lot of them are on the ground / paths and a lot are being",
          "A small butterfly park in town. Admission fee, RM12 for citizen. It's not well keep & not as beautiful as expected. However, the exibition hall is very informative & educative",
          "I was really excited to go to the butterfly park. I think I had envisioned it to be a lot better than it actually was. First of all its a bit of a drive from the city centre. The building and facilities are very run down. Its also quite a bit warmer than KL. I found it extremely",
          "this place has a wide variety of butterflies in a natural habitat. In fact the habitat itself is beautifully designed. It's a beautiful place with fountains and lush plants and butterflies of many varieties everywhere. It's a great photo stop and a very peaceful place to spend",
          "Great place to view a wide variety of butterflies in a tropical garden environment. The gardens are relatively compact with a number of ponds containing numerous fish. Also spotted a monitor lizard skulking around. There are plenty of chances to photograph butterflies in",
          "If you love them and I do this is perfect. Lots of photo opportunities and it's beautifully laid out with ponds and walkways. It is very humid though, even we felt it and we live in Thailand. We get most of the butterflies in our garden but it was wonderful to see so many of",
          "What a brilliant place. I took my daughter Emma and had a great time, so much so we revisited it again. The park is small but well laid out and for 50 ringets well worth it. I advise you all to go.",
          "This is one of the must visit place in Kuala Lumpur. It has a wide variety of butterflies in a natural habitat. In fact the habitat itself is beautifully designed. It has a good library and museum of moths, butterflies and insects. There is a gift shop too. It is located next to",
          "We were very keen to visit this park with our kids, expected a huge park with a large variety of butterflies but ended up with a tiny park couple of butterflies, which were very nice but far from the expectation. The park was covered within 20 minutes, very disappointing as we",
          "Thrilling experience of being so close to colourful butter flies of multi sizes hovering around the flowers and enjoying the virgin honey. Many are merged deep inside honey that it cant notice even being touched",
          "Flabbergasted to see the amazing collection of butterflies from all over the world in great colours. The museum is worth visiting",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the butterfly park. The visitor centre/gift shop needs a bit of TLC but this didn't impact on our enjoyment. As mentioned in other reviews, there are dead insects but given the 1000's of insects free to roam this is no surprise!",
          "This Butterfly park is a nice stop from your busy touristy schedule. Here you can enjoy the scenery and take lots of pictures of water falls, ponds with Koi Fish and of course the main attractions, the butterfly's. Entrance fee's aren't as expensive as the Bird Park. After your",
          "Was Dissapointed with the butterflys.maybe it was because the sun wasnt out,a lot of them looked as though they wernt in condition, as I said visitng on a sunny day it could be totaly different",
          "A chance to see native butterflies up close and take photos. There were also fish, Terrapins and other creepy crawlies if you're brave enough!",
          "A lovely park where the butterflies come sitting on your hand and if you do not be carefull fly into your mouth! So watch out with those open mouths! Nice exemplaries are present and wonderfull to look at. min 2h visit is recommended. Time flies when you are here.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised with my trip to the KL butterfly part. It's a beautiful garden area full of fountains and lush plants and butterflies of many varieties everywhere. It's a great photo stop and a very peaceful place to spend an hour or so. I hit it on a day when the",
          "This one came totally unexpected. I actually didn'nt want to go. But my girlfriend convinced me and what we found, was a tiny park, lush in greenery with very beautiful and extremely big butterflies flying around freely.",
          "This place was difficult to find, we were not the only people walking around with a map. But it was well worth the effort. The butterflies were beautiful. The insectarium was fascinating.",
          "This si a very nice region of the Park Lake area - many butterfly species native to the area are in the enclosure, and they have done a nice job of setting up the walkways to incorporate landscaped garden beds. The park is quite small, but bigger than many butterfly enclosures I",
          "Yesterday (Saturday 7th Oct 2017) we went to the Butterfly Park specifically to get some photos of butterflies. When we enquired how many butterflies there were they said there wasn't many available to view which I thought was a good honest reply. We asked if we could possibly",
          "I spent my birthday here and I absolutely loved it. It is like a rain forest environment with plenty of butterflies. There are places to sit and rest and just enjoy the peace and quiet. Loved it. Don't visit on a Friday (there's a major mosque across the road and the traffic was",
          "We visited this attraction with our small grandchild who was quite fascinated by the way the butterflies came and landed on your hair, shoulders and even your face. It was a short visit and we only saw a few varieties but these were mostly very colourful and large. Some of the",
          "A great place to explore Butterflies and Insects. Full of different varieties A big place to explore the butterflies. Not good for a rainy day as its open air.",

          "It is a small place not big but sure the place will make you smile when you see the different colors of butterflies and also you can feed the fishes. You wont take inside more than an hour and half maximum . The humidity inside is too high as it is a small place and stuffed with",
          "Fiona loves the natural beauty of birds, flowers, butterflys and nature in general. A great place to get up close to a huge number of stunningly beautiful butterflys and the gardens and ponds are magnificent",
          "The Butterfly Park is a place to visit if you have half a day or less to spare. It has a wealth of information on all sorts of creatures and backs that up with some great displays. Wandering around the park it's not long before you notice most visitors are more interested in the",
          "Visited on Sunday noon..not much crowded hardly below 30 pepole were there..Fare is 25RM for Adult and 14 RM for kids. Completed full round in less than an hour. Good colour butterflies and colorfull fishes were there..nice and a bit cool place in hot KL. Kids enjoy the place",
          "This place is situated in a large complex of museums and other parks (bird park, orchid and hibiscus garden) The fee is a fair price and there are lots of varieties of butterflies of varying colours and sizes. The place had quite a few different viewing areas which were nice. I",
          "Butterflies are beautiful especially tropical one. The garden also is nice and well designed. However, the reason that I gave 3 is that the way staffs are facing tourists to participate. At the first step, they never mention anything but when you buy the ticket and go inside",
          "lots of flowers, kois and butterflies. it was a good respite from KL's punishing heat. entrance is RM 25 for foreign visitors.",
          "Can spend about 2-4hours. Price RM12 (for local) is decent. Nice ambient with manmade waterfalls. Couple of centigrades colder environment despite KL city heat. Well maintained, clean. Can learn more about Malaysia's own insects (which I never knew this while).",
          "Expensive and small although it was beautiful they cleaned the walkways while we were walking around the park and jogging to change the road. I think the time was not suitable for cleaning or visiting perhaps",
          "A run down park with about 5 different types of butterfly roaming the humid gardens. Admittedly, there are some beastly butterflies at large and plenty to see. Staff are all on their phones catching up on coronation street in between taking the 25 MLR off your hands. The",

          "Great park to take a break from the city and watch the butterflies and fish. Amazing butterflies and so many beautiful colours. Well worth a visit.",
          "This park is well maintained. There are a lot of butterflies in different shapes and colors. There is a museum inside which you can learn more about insects.",
          "We visited the butterfly park as a group of seven with parents and child ages from 3 to 60+. We all enjoyed our visit. It was an outdoor semi artificial garden area (as in the butterflies were not in glass cages but flying around) and the whole park was enclosed with net. Not a",
          "This was amazing! They got all sorts, colours, shapes of butterflies and its just amazing to see them all in one place, just have to be careful not to kill any! It was very scenic.",
          "if you visit the bird park, then you can easily visit the butterfly park, as it is just opposite the butterfly.",
          "Good value for money, well maintained and very interesting. We enjoyed our visit and found the park to be relatively clean, tidy and we'll maintained, with plenty of different butterflies etc. to see. The insects and other things indoors were a bonus!",
          "we went there with kids excited to see all the butterflies. however during our brief 15 mind visit we did not see more than 5 butterflies. Entry is ticketed so its very sad that they do not have any mechanism to have butterflies in the open. apparently all the butterflies are",
          "The space for the butterflies is not very big but is very pretty. the butterflies won't land on you like in other parks and they are all on the roof as if they want to escape. I wouldn't recommend going here for the price. There is also a room of insects which are all kept in",
          "An inedit place with many kinds of butterflys but not so amasing if you are not a passionate. Nice for children but very warm and wet in July.",
          "This is a slice of nature in the middle of the busy metropolis and is a treat. Vast variety of free flying butterflies to see. Very interesting for kids. However, the place could be better maintained. This is close to the bird park and is best accessible by taxi or by bus from",
          "This was a delightful experience. The butterfly garden is fairly small, but has enough to offer in terms of butterflies, trees, and flowers. The display about butterflies that was shown in the end could well be shown at the beginning of the visit, but that is a matter of choice.",
          "I expected to see huge beautiful butterflies but it is really a beautiful garden with some butterflies, a pond with beautiful huge fish.it was really really hot.only after we got out the garden in the hall next to it we saw dried beautiful butterflies on the walls",
          "Great place.Had never visited a butterfly park before. had real fun observing the different butterflies and luckily got to see different stages of caterpillar turning into butterfly. Amazing",
          "I want this place as my backyard. It is so tranquil and almost like a fantasy land. Definitely recommend this oasis in the middle of KL. half the price of the bird sanctuary and even more beautiful inside. ( and no caged birds )",
          "This is actually owned by a private citizen. You can learn a lot about butterflies and moths if you slow down and observe carefully.",
          "The butterfly park had a large quantities of different butterflies when we were there. We didn't expect much and were pleasantly surprised by how much time we actually spent there. Yes, it is extremely humid, but it makes the perfect environment for the butterflies. I was able",
          "Gets hot. Best to go early in the day or later on, Not just butterflies but other critters on display including fish.",
          "If you appreciate the wonder of these beautiful creatures then the visit is worth your money and time without a doubt. The butterflies are simply stunning but you need to be aware that the heat and humidity (fine for the butteflies) is quite taxing. A nicely designed area and",
          "I have never felt so much disgusted with spending money on an attraction as much as this. The experience completely lets you down. Here are the reasons: - The place is small and not maintained. You see dead butterflies, unclean pathways - No info or guide - you expect some",
          "We came here on a very warm day. I've been to butterfly parks in other countries before and they were much better than this. The facilities here were very run down. Toilet are free but horrible like most in Malaysia no tissue, there were seats though so that's always a bonus!",
          "Nice park but seen only less butterflies But we liked the museum inside which has some unique butterflies preserved .",
          "I went twice to this place and it's worth the visit. First time I went alone for photography. If you are going with that objective, you will find a lot of butterflies with wonderful colors. Obviously, patience is needed to get the right picture. Note that tripods are not allowed",
          "Disappointed. Rundown. Facility appears poorly maintained. Needs an urgent upgrade. At least some painting will help. Exhibit area air conditioning not working properly. Everything just look old like from decades ago. Toilet seat disgusting.",
          "This park is very nice, along with the collection and variety of plants. It costs 22RM for adults and 11RM for children. There was a very well prepared natural habitat for butterflies, lots of flowers of different species, an artificial waterfall, an artificial pond with fishes",
          "I was last here three years ago and, even though I have a fear of butterflies, have very positive memories of my experience. Sadly this time did not match up to my memory. We saw lots of dying or dead butterflies and the colour of the dead insects in the gallery/museum at the",
          "In opposition to the Bird Park the rather small Butterfly Park is a quiet paradise with many colorful butterflies...",
          "This is a great place for a slight stroll around the gardens to watch the butterflies. Great for young and old",
          "The park is nice to see. There are a lot of butterfly's and nice plants. But it is a little but small.",
          "This place apparently promotes the appreciation of butterflies. Well step next door into the shop and you will have the opportunity to buy a large selection of dead framed butterflies from all over the world. I was informed these were all 'wild caught' and had the approval of",
          "I suppose my expectations were too high. It's a hike to get there, and then there is about 20 minutes of things to do. The butterflies are pretty, but that's about it.",
          "This is a relatively small but nonetheless interesting place to visit with a good selection of butterflies. It also has some interesting insect exhibits (in the air con!). Probably better in the morning as its very humid in the enclosure before it gets too hot.",
          "my Grandfather loved butterflies, so when we had a little extra time in KL, I took my family to the butterfly park...there are zoos and bird parks in most cities, but the butterfly park is something different. Walking through the park, amongst the butterflies is something we",
          "Very hot, not very large for the amount charged and a disappointing number of butterflies - save your money and visit Entopia on Penang instead",
          "We like photography and we decided to visit this place. I think to go there by taxi is the most convenient way. entrance fee is fair. the spot is not that big, but if you like photography you find many lovely butterflies, dragonflies, praying manties, frogs, lizards. A good",
          "If you have seen any other Butterfly garden or park you don't need to pay a visit to this one. Not bad but nothing extra special.",
          "Really nice morning spent amongst butterflies in their natural environment. Nice photo opportunities and very informative. Recommended if you have an hour or two to spare and love butterflies",
          "Given my fear of flying creatures I wasn't looking forward to being surrounded by butterflies and had to ask the lady at the ticket desk about how big they were before buying a ticket! Took the plunge eventually and managed to survive it! Takes around an hour to walk around and",
          "A fee of 25 Ringgit is charged to enter but it is fully worth it if you are an animal / insect lover. The park has about 66 varieties of butterflies. Some are quite big and they are of different shapes,colours and sizes which makes a spectacular sight. It is a popular",
          "So beautiful! At one point I even had a butterfly attach itself to my leg and refuse to leave! \ud83e\udd8b Reasonable price!!",
          "The Butterfly Pavilion at Kuala Lumpur was not as it was advertised. The numbers of Butterflies were minimal compared to the much smaller Butterfly House in Melbourne Zoo. However, the variety of Butterflies in the the Pavilion was great, including the beautiful landscaped",
          "we stumbled upon this by accident. So glad that we did. Cheap to get in and a very good way to find that about two hours has flown by (pardon the pun); and we could have spent longer! Our camera shows that we took over 200 potographs in the time we were there, and it could",
          "Walked here from across the river to have a relaxing day. The butterfly park is pretty small, but has a wide variety of plants and butterflies. It's pretty humid, which is expected to keep the environment stable. Cost of admission was 25 RM for adults. I enjoyed the walk around",
          "The park is fair ... its not amazing, doesnt include that variety of butterflies.. its mainly a plant and fish garden , but u have the chance to see some butterflies turning around, if u have visited the botanical garden or the birds park , no need to enter it .",
          "Very beautiful place, go there if you like butterflies and nature. We were not very lucky with the weather, after 10 minutes inside heavy rain started, so butterflies were hiding as well. Reasonable price. Big butterfly collection inside the \"museum\". Nice walking paths and",
          "I liked it overall. A nice place, if you're interested in butterflies or insects in general, then this is a must for you. Even if you arent, spend some time here.",
          "Very Enjoyable and well worth the Entrance Fee of 25 Ringgit.. Make sure you examine every nook and cranny as some are more densely populated by the butterflies than others. It can get very humid inside too, so maybe take a bottle of water, you can buy in the entrance area. Very",
          "One of the best place to go with kids in KL. Great outdoor and takes a full day, lots of information and great collection of birds.",
          "It is located close to Kuala Lumpur Bird Park approximately 5 - 8 minute walk. The park is filled with butterfly but it does not provide you with a map or an index to explain which butterfly is which. A bit more explanation will be helpful. Is a good place to spend around 1 hour",
          "This is the second butterfly park i visit, also seen one in Bali. This one is quite large and is nicely made (small waterfalls, nice trails). Entree fee is 25rm per person. I liked the souvenir shop! Normally I DONT like souvenir shops. Prices are normal. The quality of the",
          "The price for Malaysian abit expensive,inside butterfly not many ,just go in 10minute then coming out already..",
          "Nice for taking pictures since you can see some of free butterflies and fish. Small area to walk inside ticket rate 28 R",
          "First off, this will provide half an hour of entertainment at the very best. It's a butterfly park, so unless you're a fan (but who isn't), you won't find much excitement in the main Daves House. It is beautiful and peaceful and it's fun to see the many butterflies flutter",
          "We were not disappointed. The variety and number of butterflies is amazing. The gardens are stunning.",
          "A lovely garden with plenty packed into a small space. There are water features & lots of different paths to follow. Plenty of seating to just sit and watch the butterfly's. Finishing with a display of bugs at the end",
          "The park except that they charge a lot more for foreigners. I find that unfair. Those with Malaysia ID can pay cheaper.",
          "Spent a couple of hours at the KL Butterfly Park, in the morning when it's not too hot. Bring mosquito repellent as it's very humid and has lots of water features. We saw many different varieties of butterflies. Some of the larger ones will stay up by the netting so, but if",
          "If you love butterflies, then why not visit this place? Its beautiful and brings you very much close to nature.",
          "Park is nice and green with lots of water features with fish swimming happily around and there are butterfly's but most are small and tend to stay at the top of the netting.",
          "Many beautiful butterflies in all sizes and colours. In a big space, a little tropical garden. Better than the birdpark in my opinion.",
          "It was raining, slippery and not really suitable for anyone with any physical limitations, lots of steps and little shelter.",
          "The entire takeaway of this visit was 'overpriced'. 1. For what you get, the entry fee to the park is a fairly stunning RM22 per person. 2. Do not get involved with taxis in either direction. It's a known tourist attraction, and rip-off merchants abound. Cabs from the venue are",
          "it's small, it's cheap, it's pretty and if you sit and watch the butterflies on one of the many seats it feeds the soul. The shop is rubbish but I like this park enough to have been three times",
          "A short walko through an intensely green garden with fountains, aquariums with turtles and lobsters is what makes KL's butterfly park. There's also a section of live and preserved insects for visitors to see. Great place to pick up butterfly souvenirs.",
          "Good park, reasonable entry fee expect to spend about an hour here. Could do with more variety of butterflies. But the park itself is quite and tranquil",
          "It was an early morning , when we arrived, as one of the readers suggested to get more butterflies varieties - yes , it is not huge place, while we spend there around 1 hour watching and making photos - it just beautiful and scenic place! small waterfalls and ponds, along with",
          "The Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park was a lot better than I perceived it would be and almost from the moment I wanted into the covered and netted park I was amazed by the sheer number or butterflies flying about or resting, or drinking water from sprinkler puddles. They were",
          "The best butterfly park I ever see, not so big, but a lot of butterflies are flying around you )) I bit fast from the city center, better to use the carb service",
          "We had never been to a butterfly park before visiting here, so it was something different. It was a nice experience and we had a good time.",
          "Was expeting much better experience when planning. I would say i was but disappointed when visited the place. Open area for butterflies is average. But while taking an exit the stuffed insect museum is worth it.",
          "There are a large number of butterflies in the park but there could be more flowers around the park to allow the butterflies to be fully appreciated. There is an interesting section at the end of the park showing a huge collection of pinned insects.",
          "I love butterflies so to be surrounded by them was perfect. you can get up really close to all of them and see how many different types there are. beautiful little place to experience something new.",
          "For 2 adukts and a 5yr old it cost 55rm which we thought was expensive. Its very small and unless you literally walk like a snail your round there really quick. The toilets, well, have no paper and you need to use the bucket with a jug to flush. Obviously the butterflys are",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Just around the corner from KL Bird Park. Vast array of beautiful butterflies with some great photo opportunities. Really nice just to be able to amble around the butterfly house, admiring the waterfalls, flowers and Butterflies.",
          "in my opinion the place is overrated and expensive without any guide or brochure about butterflies. and beware that the place is not accessible for wheelchair or strollers",
          "I loved it. It's small, but quite an experience. It feels very tropical. I think they generate a higher temperature/humidity, because it definitely was more hot and stuffy then outside, it was sort of sauna-like. Definitely take some water to drink. The place is very cute,",
          "Excellent place to spot butterflies and take pictures of them. The park is smaller than the bird park and not that crowded. It's really nice to relax and follow the butterflies. The room with the insects is also very exciting!",
          "A very beautiful garden with varieties of colored butterflies, beautiful plants. it will take an hour of two to enjoy the calmness and serenity of the place",
          "If you are in the chaotic craze of KL then the butterfly park is a good escape from the noise of the city. When I went the butterflies were not plentiful but that depends on the season but it was nice to get away from the chaos of KL even if it was only ever just a few steps",
          "disappointing as no where near as many butterflies as we were expecting and also alot of the same variety,the layout is good and they have several places where they feed the butterflies to make it easier for you to good good views of them and take photos.",
          "As it was our last day and we saw already many things in KualaLumpur we decided to go to the butterfly park.And what a good decision it was.So very peaceful and beautiful made.Very cool and clean.Never saw so many beautiful butterflies together.Beautiful flowers all well taken",
          "We visited the Butterfly park today, lovely little garden full of butterflies. Very good price and friendly staff. Slightly difficult to find on foot, need a good map and idea on directions. Nice little place to spend the afternoon with food and drink facilities as well.",
          "The receptionist said : No butterfly you will see . All of them are sleeping. They need sunny weather to go out !",
          "We went on an exceptionally hot day with our family of four and paired it with the bird park up the road as they are close and compliment each other. The ability to be up close and personal with so many different types of butterflies was unlike anything else I have experienced.",
          "fees charged was higher , lots of butterfly and fish variety nothing else to see so not pocket friendly you can click some good memories with butterflies",
          "My guess is that this place is a bit hit and miss when it comes to the number of butterflies you may see. When we visited, there really were many and they were everywhere. The park is in a mildly decaying state and could do with some maintenance and improvements. However, we",
          "Its a bit cramped but the butterflys are every where. Plenty of information included. The temperature is quite high as is the humidity, but needed for the insects.",
          "+a beautiful garden +great place to relax +great scorpion, bugs, spiders etc +nice canned insects -no butterflies... (just few, they have there a huge space and too few butterflies so you will not see a lot of colored butterflies that fly along and stay on your nose...no way.",
          "The site is old and barely maintained. Lots of renovation should take place? Discriminated entrance fee which I hate (22 foreigner, 11 locals). Why? Way less varieties of butterflies than in Penang for example and overall few only in the entire site. Won t come back",
          "I loved the place very much during my visit to Malaysia. The park is located in a nice area and the place is designed in beautiful natural way. Lots of butterflies and fishes were there, also a small museum of stuffed insects and butterflies were there. This is a nice place to",
          "Good place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. We visited in the evening and there were not many tourist left. Many beautiful butterflies flying around. They have kept honey soaked fruit pieces for the butterflies to suck on which is beautiful to watch. I spent close to",
          "Costly for what it was. Slippery paths, covered with moss. We didn't see anything like the butterfly in this picture. Poured with rain which is not their fault but there wasn't anywhere to seek shelter.",
          "This is a well-located and conceived attraction with some super butterfly species flying in tropical gardens. However, the site is small so you will not need too long, while there are various reptiles etc which to me seem like unnecessary add-ons.A pleasing asset is the natural",
          "Granted I have never been to a butterfly park - but this was amazing!!! So many butterflies to see as well as plants and some lovely places to sit and enjoy the environement! Super hot in there though so be prepared. Also please don't be like the tourists who were there when I",
          "After wandering the streets of KL a bit ended up at the park. It was 30+ degrees outside and close enough to 100% humidity. The park was quiet so we just found a comfortable place in the shade to sit among the butterflies. All that I needed was a book to read and could have sat",
          "Well laid out and filled with so many beautiful butterflies as well as some great specimens of Koi carp. We found it a relaxing and very peaceful location and clearly a lot of thought had gone into the layout. An enterance fee of 22 ringgit each was reasonable and in addition",
          "My family and myself decided to visit the same KL Butterfly Park we attended 10 years ago when my sister and I were both kids. Still to this day, the mini park was well kept and tidy. The multiple animal attractions such as turtles, koi fish, snakes, spiders, scorpions added",
          "If it's raining you won't see ANYTHING! When we complained to the lady in the ticket office she claimed she had advised us that there isn't much to see when it's raining. LIE! She didn't! There was no question of a refund or a reduction. Seriously, avoid this place if it's not",
          "The place is filled with butterflies and has quite a lot of measures to keep butterflies hovering in places where we can see them, with honeys and fruits placed on plates everywhere to attract them. Might not look luxurious or very professional, but it's a very good get away.",
          "It's a pleasant experience, though nothing special. A little cheaply constructed. The range of butterflies is limited, though there are quite a lot",
          "The park was a truly serene tropical garden in which to escape the heat. The landscaping and flora was truly outstanding. The fountains and water features were really beautiful. The ponds were well stocked with Koi fish of many colours. The only disappointment was the lack",
          "Our Day 1 Tour at Kuala Lumpur was in this park, its a little humid that day we visited it. A visit to this park was on top of my list to show my daughter the beauty of nature specially the butterflies. I was expecting to see a lot of it but I felt little sad because there are",

          "We spent a good 90 minutes here wandering around. Lots and lots of butterflies flying around which fascinated our 7yr old daughter. Some even landed on her!! The RM55 fee for 2 adults and 1 child was reasonable. We went in the middle of the day and although it was hot and humid,",
          "I've been here a couple of times in the past few years (even though I'm scared of moths, butterflies lol) Some beautiful specimens here.",
          "This is a must if visiting KL. Only a small area but carefully landscaped with waterfalls, fountains , pools, tropical plants and flowers. The main attraction is of course the exquisite butterflies .They seem to be oblivious to people as they flit around the gardens. If you go",
          "Nice little butterfly park, the gardens were nice but think it's starting to get a bit old now. The butterflies were beautiful. All of the displays are in dire need of an upgrade. some of the photos must have been taken in the eighties and look it. Over all a nice hour",
          "Really wonderful place gives all an insight into these beautiful creatures. The colours, shapes and designs are just amazing. Truly colourful spectacular.",
          "I found this park to be quite relaxing, there are a lot of areas to sit and take in the greenery and watch the butterflies. It is also very easy to walk around. The entry fee was very reasonable. I would recommend this park for a relaxing stroll",
          "The Garden and fountain are nice and relaxing, maybe sit and read book, as for the butterfly it self, there are not many can be found, maybe not the season?. Small place, you will need less the an hour inside, so make sure to plan it at the same time as bird park or other",
          "This is a small park with lots of butterflies, plants and fish. If you visit here and the bird park it would make a nice morning out. Probably better to go early to avoid the heat.",
          "This is a lovely park, a quiet respite within bustling KL. If you want butterflies to land on you, be calm, quiet and generally in the shade.",
          "Took our daughter to the butterfly park. We weren't sure what to expect but it turned out to be great fun. My daughter loved every minute we spent at this park. The park about 66 varieties of butterflies. Some are quite big. Never seen as big. And some were really colorful. As",

          "The park was below my expectations, most butterflies were way above, on nets covering the park to keep them from escaping. Did not get to see too many species, a 5-10 minute walk will get you through the whole thing, in a soaked state. Go for the much better maintained and free",
          "Quite a few species to be seen. There are other types of insects in collections and terrariums. They could have more of these out in the park to make it more interesting. Great selection of insect and butterfly collections to purchase at a reasonable price. These specimens are",
          "Butterflies galore. Outdoors (think 90 degrees Fahrenheit and, 90% humidity). The indoor and AC exhibit of insects (live and taxidermy) was unexpected, comprehensive, and educational. Many school groups apparently visit, but I had the indoor source to myself.",

          "We went to the butterfly park for a visit. It is a small garden with a few fishponds with koifish. There were quite a lot of butterflies to see. The visit of the garden can be done within an hour. The exhibition of insects and butterflies was nice, but oldfashioned in a way that",
          "The park is a lovely little escape and we spent a very happy hour here. Our young children loved the butterflies and the huge fish! The taxidermy and live insect display was fantastic but the gift shop offered great value for money! It was very very humid though!",

          "Quite a hard place to review as it combines a glorious garden with some butterflies. If you are looking for thousands of butterflies, you may be disappointed. However, the garden, bug display and water features make up for that. A short walk from the bird park so combine both",
          "It is worth combining a visit to the butterfly park with other parks near by as on it's own it is a little disappointing. The park is not suitable for wheelchairs, buggies or people who have limited mobility. There are plenty of steps (not very even) and paths that can be a",

          "For butterflies it seems ok- they can socialise and fly around but from the human perspective- it seems so horrible to be locked down under the net, it's very hot and my opinion is that's it too expensive for what it offers.",
          "Nice place for learning about insects. Good quality exhibits. A treasure.",
          "Great to immerse yourself in thousands of butterfly\u2019s. beautiful garden setting. little creeks running though out with waterfalls. lots of dense foliage to admire the insects. place is a little worse for wear. there are a lot of steps, also \u2026",
          "Little bit expensive for what it is, but plenty of insect facts and viewing straight after the butterfly enclosure/garden",
          "Interesting place to visit.  But unless you're really passionate about butterflies you'll be out there in less than an hour.\nThe 'Aquatic' tanks - turtles and fish need some serious attention \ud83e\udd28, they are not well cared for",
          "Such a colourful & tame birds as an exciting adventure to remember",

          "Bring along my sons, they are enjoy chasing butterfly",
          "Small place but very informational. The amount of different species in this small place surprised me. Be careful not to step onto the butterflies (they love standing on the floor) \nThere is a lot of other creepy crawlies on display. Good to bring kids here for an educational tour.",
          "Stayed in KL for almost 10 years. This is my first time here. My son love butterfly. Since he is learning about the butterfly's life cycle. I've decided to pay this place a visit. \n\nThe area is clean. Even though it is hot, but the net \u2026",
          "Beautiful and restful butterfly insectarium: many species of Malaysian butterflies including the Rajah Brook's Birdwing. Well planted with beautiful water falls,  kooi ponds,  aquaria,  and display of other live arthropods.",
          "Clean & kids friendly place. Toilet location is convenient. Cafe sell food with triple price of normal shop.",
          "They should have to keep maintaining the park. The park looks so old and not so clean when I went there. The trees and the plants there are not well organized. Also I don't see a lot of butterflies though",
          "Many many butterflies of different species. Great for butterfly enthusiasts. Good for photography with butterflies flying freely around you. Interesting museum too. Better than many other butterfly parks I've been.",

          "This was one of the highlights of my tour. Didn't know such butterflies every existed.",
          "Many butterflies. The big ones are harder to photograph as they tend to stick to the top of the nets.",
          "Can be improve a lot, less butterfly compare to melaka butterfly park.",
          "The butterfly garden was very nice. Lot of beautiful butterflies and other creatures (turtles, fish, etc).  The design of the area is very nice with lots of pretty water features. We would have spent more time here except the heat was a bit overwhelming. Wish they had a few more cool down areas with fans.",

          "Nice place for briskwalking after breakfast",
          "Very less spices found",

A couple of butterflies let you get really close without flying off. Butterflies are not active on cold wet days. If you are into insects it is a pretty amazing place.",
          "It\u2019s a nice place to enjoy the nature of the butterfly and mostly good for family because it\u2019s a good spot for kids to have such an amazing look at the butterflies \n   It takes about 30- 40 minutes to go around it but the flowers are not \u2026",
          "Nah nice place to release the tension",
          "24 RM per person (adult) and just some butterflies to see + a museum. Not worth the money at all. Unlike you see large number of butterflies in fairy tale movies, there is nothing much here to see for 24 RM. The nearby bird park is really good, 63 RM per person (adult). They have bird show, shouldn't miss it and lots of birds to see...",
          "Not found as expected. Small place, found very less scopes to see the butterflies. Don\u2019t know, probably the butterflies need to have places like that, but it would be better to have more wider/visible place. The decorative items prepared \u2026",

          "Interesting and hot, humid place.",

          "I didnt go there..\ud83d\ude2c",
          "The Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park is located near the Bird Park. I quite liked it. It's fun for the kids, trying to find the butterflies listed on the display. The entry fee is RM25 for adults and RM13 for kids and they don't take credit card.   \n\nClose by is the Bird Park and the Planetarium, so you might as well make a day of it.",
          "It is a nice park with a lot of information to offer about butterflies and related insects.",
          "I actually enjoyed this more than the bird park. It was great walking through the tropical garden with hundreds of the most colourful butterflies. It's not a huge place but big enough and not expensive to enter.",
          "I really enjoyed there. We spent almost 2 hours and learnt many things.",
          "Beautiful place amazing setup, can view some nature's beauty under a protected area with plenty of butterfly's which is unlikely to see in other public gardens. Place is worth the time only for nature enthuist and will be boredom the otherwise.",

        "wiki": "The National Monument is a sculpture that commemorates those who died in Malaysia's struggle for freedom, principally against the Japanese occupation during World War II and the Malayan Emergency, which lasted from 1948 until 1960. It is located in the Federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament is situated near the monument.\nIt is the world's tallest bronze freestanding sculpture grouping. Every year on 31 July on Warriors' Day, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Prime Minister, and the heads of the Malaysian Armed Forces and the Royal Malaysia Police pay their respects to the fallen heroes by laying garlands at the monument.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Kuala Lumpur Cenotaph ===\n\nThe predecessor of the National Monument is an interwar-era cenotaph originally erected by the colonial British administration on a 10m flat grass-covered ground on a roundabout adjoining Victory Avenue (now part of Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin) and Raja Road, close to the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Railway Administration Building. Originally intended to commemorate the Great War (1914\u20131918) and honour those from the British Malayan colonies who were killed in the war, the cenotaph's inscription would later include fallen British Malayan soldiers of World War II (1939\u20131945) after the conclusion of World War II and resumption of British rule. Names of the fallen are engraved on the plaques of the cenotaph as a token of tribute to their sacrifices.\nIn 1964, the cenotaph was moved from its original location to the site of the National Monument in Lake Gardens before a planned flyover connecting Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin and the Parliament roundabout was constructed over the original site. Transfer of the cenotaph was made possible by dismantling the structure into catalogued parts, allowing the structure to be transported in pieces and reassembled in its original form at the National Monument. Following its move, inscriptions were added to include fallen soldiers from the Malayan Emergency (1948\u20131960) and an archaic Malay translation of \"To Our Glorious Dead\", \"Untok Mengingati Jasa Pahlawan-pahlawan Yang Gugor\" (\"To Remember the Service of Warriors Who Have Fallen\").\nThe monument is depicted on several Malaysian 1 Ringgit banknotes issued between 1982 and 1989.\n\n\n=== National Monument ===\nThe concept of a national monument was mooted by Malaysia's first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was inspired by the Marine Corps War Memorial during his visit to the United States in October 1960, before personally meeting Felix de Weldon for a favour to design the monument.\nFelix de Weldon contributed in creating Malaysia\u2019s Tugu Negara (National Monument). He also designed the Iwo Jima Memorial located\nat Arlington, Washington DC.\nThe National Monument was completed and officially opened on 8 February 1966, by Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu, then Yang di-Pertuan Agong. It was proclaimed a memorial park dedicated to the 11,000 people who died during the 12-year Malayan Emergency (1948\u20131960). Thereafter, a wreath-laying ceremony takes place at the monument every 31 July on Warriors Day. De Weldon was later conferred with the title Tan Sri, the Malaysian equivalent of a high-ranking knighthood.\nOn 27 August 1975, the monument suffered extensive damage due to an explosion set off by a communist terrorist. It has since been restored to its original state with the renovated statues unveiled on 11 May 1977. A fence was then erected and the complex was declared a protected area between sunset and dawn. Every day at dawn, a soldier raises the national flag and lowers it at dusk.\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister's Department Jamil Khir Baharom has stated that from 2010, the Warriors' Day commemoration service would be held elsewhere after Malaysia's National Fatwa Council guidelines declared the statues \"un-Islamic\" and potentially idolatrous. Defence Minister Zahid Hamidi added that a new \"Warrior's Square\" would be built in the country's administrative capital Putrajaya. When asked why the decision was made only after almost four decades of celebrating Warriors' Day at the present site, Jamil evaded comment, saying \"Alhamdulillah, we are serious in solving this issue\". A similar sentiment would later be echoed in September 2016 by Harussani Zakaria, a Perak-based mufti, who declared that the construction of the monument had been a \"big sin\" and \"idolatrous\", because building monuments in the shape of humans was haram in Islam.\n\n\n== Design ==\nCommissioned in 1963 and constructed in 1966, the sculpture that stands as a centrepiece of the monument is 15 meters (49.21 feet) tall, made of bronze and was designed by Austrian sculptor Felix de Weldon, who was also responsible for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Virginia, United States.\nThe sculpture depicts 7 figures, 5 of the figures [1. holding the Malaysian flag, 2. armed with a rifle and bayonet (left), 3. armed with a machine gun (right), 4. soldiers tending to fifth wounded compatriot] represents the victorious allied forces while the other 2 figures that lie on the ground represents that of the defeated communist forces.\nOverall the monument depicts the victory of the forces of democracy, peace and freedom over that of communism.  The sculpture was then cast at a foundry in Rome at a cost of RM600,000.\nEach of the bronze figures symbolises leadership, suffering, unity, vigilance, strength, courage and sacrifice. The stones that the soldiers are standing on were imported from the small coastal city of Karlshamn in South Eastern Sweden.\nThe granite base of the sculpture bears the Malayan Coat of Arms, flanked on either side by inscriptions in English, Latin script, and also in Malay in Jawi script:\n\nDedicated to the heroic fighters in the cause of peace and freedom,\nMay the blessing of Allah be upon them\n\n\n== Jalan Tugu ==\nJalan Tugu, originally known as Cenotaph Road, refers to a road which was laid out following the completion of the cenotaph and adjoins the original cenotaph roundabout. The road was renamed to a direct Malay translation of the English name following a street renaming campaign during the 1960s, and continues to carry this name, as of 2013. The road runs parallel to the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, and is located opposite the Railway Administration Building and National Mosque.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn honour of our fallen heroes, New Straits Times, 16 December 2005.\nMonuments to honour the dead, The Star, 28 July 2007.\nTourism Malaysia - National Monument\nTugu Negara",

          "It was difficult to get an impression of what the square is really like at the moment as it\u2019s full of chairs and a massive cinema screen. There didn\u2019t seem a huge amount of stuff to do in the square.",

          "This is the central Piazza in Bologna. Be sure to check out the sculpture at the Fountain of Neptune. It is said to be the artist's poetic revenge. Your guide will explain. Visit as well the Basilica di San Petronio. Check out the incredibly accurate sun dial, the controversial",

          "Piazza Maggiore is certainly not the prettiest or grandest of Italian piazzas, it is however the most central. Everything stems from here, the main tourist office, the open bus tours of the city and the San Luca express. Little streets lead off the square to a large choice of",

          "Very good place to go and photograph...many cafes and bars around. . shopping, restaurants. went several times there to take more pictures..just enjoying the city !",
          "Main public square and close to many sights, it's full of cafes and shops close by. Walking from Piazza san Maggiore to the Bologna train station is a great route with all of the bustle of people and storefronts as you walk through Bologna's miles and miles of covered",
          "It\u2019s a good place to just sit and people watch and enjoy Bologna. There are shops and restaurants around the square or you can order takeout and sit at the church front steps. We visited mid-October and the weather was perfect and it wasn\u2019t crowded at all.",
          "This is a lovely piazza, quite big, very buzzy,lots going on as you would expect from a main piazza, plenty of eateries and bars, great spot to people watch and let the day or evening roll by with whatever takes your fancy",
          "Interesting for what could be seen but maybe better to come back in a few years. It seemed like half the place was under construction. It is however the center of old Bologna and therefore of modern tourists.",
          "we were in bologna for 2 weeks and visited the piazza multiple times. whether it was for lunch or gelato or going to the a festival, it was a wonderful place.",
          "A modest piazza by some Italian standards, but not too overwhelming and a friendly atmosphere! Good to sit people-watching with a gelato! Most of the people seemed to be locals,",
          "I loved this piazza because there were lots of people but very few tourists. The people of Bologna love their city and it is fun to watch them enjoy it.",
          "Loads to see and do which as an added bonus they are free. Churches and architecture is amazing and the side streets off the main square are a must see. We did the hop on hop off tour bus which is excellent value for money and the ticket is valid all day coupled with",
          "This is a very nice place with lot of palacios around. Take a small bus tour or a train tour to get around.",
          "This is the most well- known landmark in Bologna and is usually buzzing. Early on a Saturday morning it was quiet and possible to see how vast it is. It is surrounded on three sides by shops and caf\u00e9s . On the fourth side is the huge Basilica of San Petronio the patron saint of",
          "Majestic and full of history, Piazza Maguire is surrounded by Shops, cafes, the public library and museums! It has been cold and wet, and yet it only added to its charm! If you come in November bring a weather proof jacket, some comfortable boots and enjoy walking around this",
          "Bologna is an amazing city and its central piazza (Maggiore) is the base for exploring it. Starting from here you can go to the towers, for shopping or for having an aperitivo with some mortadella at the little salumerie nearby. Ofcourse you'll see the impressive church of San",
          "We sat in a bar in the square on a gloriously sunny afternoon and just watched the world go by. So much to see and enjoy.",
          "Unlike many Italian piazze this is just a big open space with nothing in the middle, though amazing fountain of Neptune with mermaids spurting water from their breasts plus a well endowed god Neptune towering over it all is to one side. The beauty of the piazza is the beautiful",
          "I wouldn't rush to see this place but inevitable you will because Bologna is that small you are bound to walk through it. Not the greatest square in Italy and not nearly as atmospheric as Florence in the evening. Whoever said Bologna wasn't a busy place has never been here on",
          "The piazza has a friendly feel and as the day progresses it became busier without ever being to busy. Several bus tours begin here as well as the tourist information centre.",
          "a wonderful place to be missed, the wonderful cathedral must be seen, nearby wonderful walks where you can buy small snacks, many restaurants and bars",
          "The main square of the city. I was expecting the cafes on the square to charge a fortune for a drink but the prices are reasonable. A small street off this square to the east side leads to the food district; a great place for a sharing meat/cheese platter. I loved visiting the",
          "This the focal point of the area. As they say....All roads lead to Rome. Off the square are many places to eat and drink and the general buzz results in an atmosphere that creates a special ambience. Nearby is the santa cruz express, a local road train where an hours tour gives",
          "The square is impressive in itself- with one of the largest churches in the world along one side how could it not be? It is also a great starting point for exploring Bologna from both a cultural and gastronomic perspective. There is so much to discover in the surrounding area.",
          "Very beautiful square, nice archhitecture and a great atmosphere of people, artists, music... Walking around it is a great experience",
          "Quite frankly I wasn't impressed. It's just a big open dirty Plaza. The fountain of Neptune however is extremely interesting if not slightly pornographic.",
          "We were here on the weekend and what a great space to people watch. There were so many things happening. While there, there were some school bands playing. I liked the ambiance.",
          "This was the city where we landed and we had only half a day and the night at disposal in Bologna, but it was really worth it. The main square it's really big and hard to miss. You can have very nice coffee and gelato, narrow streets where to wonder off, admire the buildings and",
          "You can't miss, it's in the center of Bologna. Attraction to many tourists, u should visit when in Bologna.",
          "Very nice place to have a coffee or ice cream and watch the world go by. There was a really good busker playing while we were there and everybody sits on the church steps to listen, chat or just chill!",
          "The biggest square in the city. Very nice and with a statue in the middle, which deppending on where you look at it, it seems it has a big penis. The buildings around it are ancient and well conservated.",
          "This huge square had a constant police presence and many tourists. It is stunning though and easy to reach on foot. We gave it a good look but did not linger",
          "It's not as visually a beautiful Piazza as others in Italy. The Fountain is pretty cool. It certainly gets crowded on nights and weekends. Many of the surrounding buildings are covered up.....I assume for some sort of renovation. But it certainly detracts from the experience",
          "Enjoyed our visit to this Piazza. Really good vibe specially on sundays. Lots happening around like bars, music, or just people walking around!",
          "They were refurbishing every building in the square when we went. However, it was a Saturday morning, there was an AfricanOutreach going on with thousands of red heart balloons which made it a special morning. Lovely vibe and pretty buildings. Centre of the acitivity. All roads",
          "Like San Marco in Venice, this has it all. Great restaurants and a fantastic view and ambience. No cover charge either.",
          "In spite of all the tourists including us this is a must see in Bologna The buildings surrounding the square The quirky fountain The basilica and the palaces are all worth exploring Have coffee listen to live music and watch the people ! Enjoy!,",
          "This medieval city which we haven\u2019t visited for over 25 years took our breaths away today. Nothing more than this piazza bounded by a superb Basilica a palace and other memorable buildings. Bring your camera with you. A must",
          "Gorgeous piazza to wander around, I'd say it gets incredibly busy during summer. Lots of small side streets to duck into and you'll also find the start of the portico that takes you up to San Luca.",
          "While we were there, there were free outdoor shows every night with lots of seating and if you couldn't get seats in the centre, there was outdoor seating at most restaurants/bars in the area so you still had a view",
          "Another square. What is interesting here is the shops around the edge which were of excellent quality.",
          "The main square is mainly just a big empty grubby looking space. The Neptune statue is round to one side and once you\u2019ve seen that you\u2019ve seen it all.",
          "What I think is a fantastic and almost \u2018enchanting \u2018 Statue and it\u2019s beautiful surroundings can be so relaxing to visit on a reasonable day. I have to warn, however. Do not believe that migrants posing as homeless and hungry, are not drug dealers from parts of Africa. Working",
          "We visited during the festival of san Petronius so there was live music in the piazza. There are some lovely restaurants were you can people watch and get anything from a light snack to a 3 course meal. I would recommend walking to via Stefano for ice cream. An amazing gelato",
          "When I visited, this statue was being renovated, such a shame I didn\u2019t get to see it with our the covers on.... not to worry I will have to go back",
          "It was a contrast to my previous visit earlier in the year as this time there was a Religious festival taking place which lent great ambiance to the Piazza without taking away from the enjoyment of the place.",
          "Pride of place in the square. A meeting place to sit and wonder, lots of people and street acts by the dozen",
          "This piazza was always busy. There were numerous public activities during the day and at night it was full of people enjoying the warm eveings. This is also where the tourist information office is as well as where you can catch the small train to San Lucca. Definitely worth a",
          "Lucky to arrive for the festival Francescano and were treated to the most wonderful open air concert...amazing",
          "Beautiful must see architecture, just find somewhere to sit and stare at the amazing views and surroundings.",
          "This huge piazza, flanked by historic buildings on all sides is quite simply the cultural centre of the city. Whatever you need; whatever you want to see - they are all within only a very few blocks (if that far).",
          "just an interesting piazza with lots going on during the day and busy at night with groups of people just sitting out on the piazza or on the steps to the cathedral chatting and maybe drinking. Just sat outside enjoying the warm evening and drank our beer. A chill way to spend",
          "Wow, it really is the place to base one self and, after taking in all the attractions within the piazza, you can then base yourself here whilst branching out, tentacle-like, to the sights on all 4 compass points. Start first with a visit to the Welcome Bologna Office on the",
          "Central to the city its a lively area with some great architecture. People watching on the cathedral steps is a must do, and we got to know the resident 'drunk' very well. The are was very clean with plenty of tourists doing a city walk. The Piazza was the heart of our walks out",
          "Really nice first thing in the morning when all is quiet. But cracking in the evening. Great place for chillin\u2019 with an espresso early or spritz later.",
          "The centre and heart of Bologna. A must see sight along with all the wonderfulshops, bars and restaurants. Very impressive place to visit and will return asap.",
          "Place to start your sightseeing of Bologna. Lovely red buildings which is the trademark of Bologna. Very spacious and not too many tourists even on a Sunday. The statue of Neptune is in the centre. Didn\u2019t realise Bologna used to have many canals which was the reason for the",
          "We made this our starting point each day and from here explored the city. Bologna has 7 secrets of which we found 3. A whispering corner. A little door to an underground canal and the third a genuine Michelangelo statue in a little back street church.",
          "Busy, noisy and very beautiful piazza in the heart of Bologna, Well worth visiting for the architecture and the ambience",
          "Amazing place with a lot of heart and soul right in the center of Bologna. Have a coffee, relax and enjoy!",
          "This is a big space with many imposing buildings not least the Basilica San Petronio. However having previously visited Bologna in 2007 in November during a five day Chocolate Fest, this was actually my first proper look at it.",
          "We visited several times during our visit. Neptune\u2019s fountain is a must and really needs to be appreciated from all angles with a critical eye. It\u2019s best when the water is flowing. Don\u2019t over look the neighbouring attractions, particularly the library (free entry). The acoustics",
          "Piazza Maggiore needs to be at the top of your list if you are visiting Bologna. It's very large, much to see and the people watching is excellent",
          "pleasant area to sit and have drinks and/or dinner, people watching and listening to local musicians.",
          "I liked this piazza very much, it\u2019s not to crowded. The fountain of Neptune is nearby. At night it\u2019s lighted, it had something magical. You can sit on the stairs and watch the piazza. Tip: Nearby there\u2019s whisper place. Where you whisper to the wall and your friend on the other",
          "Easy enough to find with plenty to see and do. Close to many center attractions/ There are places to sit and eat or just watch all the people.",
          "Watch the world go by while taking in this delightful piazza. Eateries, bars, shopping can all be found on nearby streets. Take in the atmosphere .... no need to rush.",
          "I was told about this \u2018trompe l\u2019\u0153il\u2019 trick by a local. Depending on where you stand on the piazza, Neptune is either modestly or well-endowed. Check out also the whispering walls where people came to confess their sins during a period of plague. Amazing acoustics transported the",
          "The central square in Bologna. Interesting by day and the place to be after dark. Don\u2019t miss it. On this square is the tourist information office and the main church.",
          "I know this has been said countless times but you simply cannot visit Bologna and not stand in Maggiore and ask yourself ... how did they build these magnificent structures? Then, of course, go inside and be even more amazed. Great square, great atmosphere and a super place to",

          "Very nice cultural city in general and the city is nice for in and out drive unless you are too much into cultural and old architecture",
          "Amazing architecture churches and museum. The centre is buzzing and is a real maze so plan ahead and get a tourist map. Loads to see here . Really enjoyed it.",
          "Doesn't matter what time of the day you come here, there is always something going on. Lots of people to watch and numerous buskers to listen to. Restaurants around the piazza are very touristy and charge accordingly so be watchful!!",
          "The piazza is grand but on our visit one of the buildings was shrouded in scaffolding which always detracts from a place. It does not have the buzz that piazzas in Florence and Rome have and felt a little flat.",
          "It seems to be the trend in Bologna - they have scaffolding and parts of structures covered which kind of ruins the experience.",
          "Nothing too remarkable, though worth checking out the Biblioteca Salaborsa and its archaeological site.",
          "This place is a must as its in the heart of Bologna and there is so much happening around the square.",
          "Being in Bologna you have to come HERE and walk around or stop for an espresso or go for a dinner in the nearby streets",

          "Amazing place with lots of exciting things to see buy and enjoy. Good with city bicycles. They are more effective.",
          "The Piazza is just outside San Petronio Church and central to The city. Whether just having a snack or doing some serious \u2018 Statue Watching\u2019, be sure to also enter the Church. Between both items you will truly enjoy 2 hours of relaxing insight into Bologna from 500 years ago!",
          "i like the area where you could see people are hanging around enjoying the great sculpture and buildings around. during the day (summer time) it is pretty hot outside, but during the evening it is very nice with beauitiful lighting and background musics from street musician",
          "I knew before we went to Bologna that I wanted to stop here. I'm glad we did. There's so much to see, from the architecture to Neptune's fountain. There's a lot of great architecture in Bologna, and this is a great place to either start or end up.",

          "Well this piazza is a meeting place for locals and tourists. The piazza is used for events like in the summer where you will enjoy movies under the stars. Around the piazza you definitely have to stroll around the small picturesque streets with lovely osterias",
          "It';s the centre of town, with a nice fountain, but not much to see. In August the cinema showing at night was impressive but we missed that .. i can imagine it's better at night",
          "Having read great things about the beauty of this square, I was disappointed to find one part covered in scaffolding and with machines in front of it, and the main part filled with an extremely unaesthetic open air cinema. Impossible to get any feeling from the square, no sense",
          "We went on a Saturday evening and they had an open air cinema that was free, beautiful atmosphere surrounded by amazing buildings",
          "This is a central location with cafe's and shops close by. It was very attractive and close to one of the main churches.",
          "The Piazza is full of stunning architecture and is right in the city centre. There is a great selection of cafes and bars which aren\u2019t extortionate (which is surprising considering the location).

          "On our first day in Bologna we had booked a private guide through Lokafy. He suggested we rented bikes so we could get around faster and that was a great idea. The first place he took us was Pizza Maggiore which seemed to be the perfect place to start the tour. There is a great",
          "Even though it is in the center of town, the bar prices are not outrageous, so I would often find myself back here for a beer or spritz in one of its bars, taking in the view of the Basilica and watching life go by. When I was there, the square was filled with seats for the free",
          "Nice piazza, great photo opps. There was an open outdoor cinema on whilst we visited. Great atmosphere.",

          "Nothing special. We sat down in the shadow for some drinks. The piazza seems to host movies under the stars summertime. So piazza gets crowded early evening. If you have seen one piazza.. you have seen them all",
          "This piazza was a beautiful spot of the city. It had this sculpture that was quite interesting because of a visual illusion it has. Generally the piazza it is a nice place to sit and enjoy some gellato at the steps of the church or at a cafe.",
          "A big medieval (maybe older) square in a center of old Bologna. Surrounded by buildings with shops and caf\u00e9s. In the summer, the entire square turns into one large cinema. In one corner of the square is also the beautiful Neptune's fountain.",
          "Beautiful square in the centre of Bologna. We never seemed to get away from it, wherever we went, we seemed to end up at Piazza Maggiore! Fantastic fountain of Neptune in the centre The tourist office is good, although you sort of have to have questions in mind to ask rather",

          "This is really a center landmark of the city along with the 2 towers (which are not far away at all). The buildings in the piazza are all worth a look at. The Basilica is not to be missed, of course. This Piazza is a meeting place for many. The Neptuno statue is nice, but we",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Basilica of San Petronio is a minor basilica and church of the Archdiocese of Bologna located in Bologna, Emilia Romagna, northern Italy. It dominates Piazza Maggiore. The basilica is dedicated to the patron saint of the city, Saint Petronius, who was the bishop of Bologna in the fifth century. Construction began in 1390 and its main facade has remained unfinished since. The building was transferred from the city to the diocese in 1929; the basilica was finally consecrated in 1954. It has been the seat of the relics of Bologna's patron saint only since 2000; until then they were preserved in the Santo Stefano church of Bologna.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nIn 1388, the Consiglio Generale dei Seicento prepared the construction of the church as a civic temple. To make room for the church, the adjacent Curia of Sancti Ambrosii was demolished, together with the majority of one of the city's burgs, including at least eight churches and towers. The first stone of construction was laid on 7 June 1390 under the supervision of architect Antonio di Vincenzo. Works lasted for several centuries: after the completion of the first version of the facade, in 1393 the first pair of side chapels were begun. The series were completed only in 1479.The third bay was built in 1441\u20131446. Its construction was delayed by the cardinal Baldassarre Cossa, who sold the construction material of the basilica and kept the money.\n\nIn 1514, Arduino degli Arriguzzi was chosen as the architect to construct the dome. His proposal included a large dome resting upon the width between the side aisles, which necessitated larger transepts and apses. This led to a form of a Latin cross, which was said to outdo St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The project was considered too complicated, and after building the first two pillars and two triangular pylons for the dome, the work was halted. According to legend, Pope Pius IV halted the \"megalomaniac dream\" and instead encouraged the construction of the Archiginnasio of Bologna.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe basilica is a large church measuring 132 metres long, 66 metres wide, and 47 metres tall, and is described as the \"most imposing\" church in Bologna. The fa\u00e7ade was designed by Domenico da Varignana and started in 1538 by Giacomo Ranuzzi. However, it remains unfinished.The main doorway (Porta Magna) was decorated by Jacopo della Quercia of Siena with scenes from the Old Testament on the pillars, eighteen prophets on the archivolt, scenes from the New Testament on the architrave, and a Madonna and Child, Saint Ambrose and Saint Petronius on the tympanum. It is flanked by two side doors, with Alfonso Lombardi's Resurrection on the left and Amico Aspertini's Deposition on the right.The central nave covering and apse shooting were completed in 1663, designed by Girolamo Rainaldi and directed by Francesco Martini. The lower naves are enclosed by rectilinear walls. The first two windows were designed by Antonio with the assistance of Francesco di Simone, Domenico da Milano, Pagno di Lapo Portigiani and Antonio di Simone. The bell tower was designed by Giovanni da Brensa and built between 1481 and 1487. \nIn 2017, the proposal for completing the facade by Inter-Esse Studio was awarded the first place in the international competition of wall was held by CODE - Competitions for Designers and Con-fine Art.\nDetails of the decoration of the main doorway by Jacopo della Quercia, photographed by Paolo Monti\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nThe interior houses a Madonna with Saints by Lorenzo Costa the Younger, and a Piet\u00e0 by Amico Aspertini.\n\n\n==== Main altar ====\nThe altar contains a 15th-century wooden crucifix. At the back, a fresco of the Madonna with St. Petronio by Marcantonio Franceschini and Luigi Quaini, cartoons by Cignani (1672). The ciborium of the main altar was built in 1547 by Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola.The fifteenth-century wooden choir was completed by Agostino de 'Marchi. The vaulting and decoration of the central nave is by Girolamo Rainaldi, who completed them in 1646-1658.\n\n\n==== Side chapels ====\nThe nave contains twenty-two side chapels:\n\nChapel of St. Abbondio, formerly of the Dieci di Balia - restored in neo-Gothic style in 1865. In this chapel, in the year 1530, Emperor Charles V was crowned by Pope Clement VII.\nChapel of St. Petronio, once of the Cospi and Aldrovandi families, designed by Alfonso Torreggiani, designed to contain the relic of the head of San Petronio.\nChapel of St. Ivo, Formerly of the family of San Brigida dei Foscherari: it has statues of Angelo Pi\u00f2 and the paintings of the Madonna of St. Luke and Saints Emidio and Ivo by Gaetano Gandolfi and Apparition of the Virgin to St. Francesca Romana by Alessandro Tiarini (1615). On the pillar, two clocks, one of the first made in Italy with the correction of the pendulum (1758).\nChapel of the Magi, once of Bolognini family: its marble Gothic balustrade designed by Antonio di Vincenzo (1400); the Triptych wooden altar with twenty-seven figures carved and painted by Jacopo di Paolo. The walls were painted by Giovanni di Pietro Falloppi/Giovanni da Modena with a cycle depicting the Episodes in the life of San Petronio, the back wall, right wall, Stories of the Three Kings; the left wall, at the top,The Last Judgment with the Coronation of the Virgin in oval, and the controversial Heaven and Hell, Dante's depiction of the places, with a gigantic figure of Lucifer.\nChapel of St. Sebastian, once of Vaselli family..\nChapel of St. Vincent Ferrer, formerly of the Griffoni, and Cospi-Ranuzzi families: bronze monument of Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro made by Giacomo Manz\u00f9 (1954).\nChapel of St. James, formerly of the Rossi and Baciocchi families: the Madonna Enthroned on the altar was painted by Lorenzo Costa (1492), to the same author attributed the designs of the stained glass.

The musical organisation had been officially instituted by Pope Eugenius IV in 1436; the first regularly paid instrumentalists were added in the late sixteenth century, and in the seventeenth century San Petronio was renowned for its sacred instrumental and choral music, with its two great organs, completed in 1476 and 1596, both still in remarkably original condition; the library remains a rich archival repository.  Three successive maestri di cappella marked the great age of music at San Petronio: Maurizio Cazzati (1657\u201371), Giovanni Paolo Colonna (1674\u201395) and Giacomo Antonio Perti (1696\u20131756). The current maestro, since 1996, is the harpsichordist Sergio Vartolo who has revitalised the cappella with a series of recordings for Naxos, Tactus, Brilliant Classics and Bongiovanni.\n\n\n== Cassini's Meridian Line ==\n\nThe church hosts also a marking in the form of a meridian line inlaid in the paving of the left aisle in 1655; it was calculated and designed by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who was teaching astronomy at the University. \nA meridian line does not indicate the time: instead, with its length of 66.8 metres (219 ft) it is one of the largest astronomical instruments in the world, allowing measurements that were for the time uniquely precise. The sun light, entering through a 27.07 mm (1.066 in) hole placed at a 27.07 m (88.8 ft) height in the church wall, projects an elliptical image of the sun, which at local noon falls exactly on the meridian line and every day is different as to position and size. The position of the projected image along the line allows to determine accurately the daily altitude of the sun at noon, from which Cassini was able to calculate with unprecedented precision astronomical parameters such as the obliquity of the ecliptic, the duration of the tropical year and the timing of equinoxes and solstices.\nOn the other hand, the size of the projected sun's image, and in particular its rate of variation during the year, allowed Cassini the first experimental verification of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\nCassini and Domenico Guglielmini published an illustrated account of how the meridian line was accomplished in 1695.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBolognese bell ringing art, which was conceived and created in the Basilica's bell tower\nSanta Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, whose meridian line Pope Clement XI commissioned to rival Bologna's\nPalazzo dei Banchi\nPalazzo d'Accursio\nPalazzo del Podest\u00e0, Bologna\nPalazzo dei Notai\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHeilbron, J.L.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Sanctuary of the Madonna of San Luca is a basilica church in Bologna, northern Italy, sited atop a forested hill, Colle or Monte della Guardia, some 300 metres above the city plain, just south-west of the historical centre of the city.While a road now leads up to the sanctuary, it is also possible to reach it along a 3.8 km monumental roofed arcade (Portico di San Luca) consisting of 666 arches, which was built in 1674\u20131793. It was meant to protect the icon as it was paraded up the hill. A yearly procession from the Cathedral of San Pietro in the centre of Bologna to the Sanctuary goes along this path. Originally the arches held icons or chapels erected by the patron family.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA church or chapel existed on the hill for about a thousand years. Tradition hold that in the 12th-century, a pilgrim from the Byzantine empire came to Bologna with an icon of the Virgin from the temple of Saint Sofia in Constantinople. In 1160, the bishop of Bologna Gerardo Grassi assigned the icon to a small hermitage-chapel atop the hill that was tended by two holy women, Azzolina and Beatrice Guezi. Construction of a church began in 1193. In 1294, some monks of the Dominican order from the monastery of Ronzano came to the site, and the order remained here until the Napoleonic suppression of 1799.The present church was constructed in 1723 using the designs of Carlo Francesco Dotti. The lateral external tribunes were built by Carlo Francesco's son, Giovanni Giacomo, using his father's plans. The centrally planned sanctuary has painted artworks by Domenico Pestrini, Donato Creti (second chapel on right); Guido Reni (Assumption in the third altar on the right), Giuseppe Maria Mazza in chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, Vittorio Bigari (frescoes) and Guercino (sacristy). Stucco works are by A. Borelli and G. Calegari and statues by Angelo Pi\u00f2.\n\n\n== Cycling ==\nThe road leading up to the church is often used in professional cycling races. The Italian autumn classic race Giro dell'Emilia finishes on a circuit where the riders have to climb the road several times. It has also been used in the Giro d'Italia, where it made its debut in 1956 in an individual time trial stage won by Charly Gaul.\n\n\n== Cable car ==\n\nFrom 1931 to 1976 an aerial cable car operated from the base of the hill on the outskirts of Bologna, to the summit. The total distance covered in the 7 minute travel time was 1328m with a vertical difference of 220m. The operation was closed due to increased usage of private transport to ascend the hill. The top station is abandoned but intact, the bottom station has been converted into apartments but remains structurally the same, and the single pylon remains intact in a field.\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipality of Bologna\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Some incredible views from the top and inside the church itself. I took the express train up from Bologna as it was very hot. The walk up looked very challenging but I would save it for a cooler day.",
          "We took the San Luca Express up to the Basilica, a rather noisy, bumpy ride but well worthwhile for the views along the way and at the top. The Basilica itself is spectacular but the views are more significant. For me the best bit it the route down, around 3 km of continuous",
          "We drove up here from the centre of Bologna, and it took about 15 minutes to navigate the windy, scenic roads. The views from the top are incredible, especially of the surrounding countryside. If you want to get the best views of the Sanctuary itself then they can be seen from",
          "We took a taxi to the top and walked down. It is quite impressive but if you had walked up - probably taken 1+ hrs in the heat, and we saw a lot of hot and sweaty people! - you might be disappointed. It is quite pretty. The view is pretty but not spectacular, mainly as there",
          "We took the toy train up to the sanctuary. Previous reviewers talked about the bunfight to begin the train. They seemed to have listened in the up direction. The train provides an interesting tour of the south west of Bologna, following the line of the porticoes for quite a bit",
          "We are lazy, so we took the 58 bus from villa Spada. Nice view and great walk down under the portico.",
          "The Madonna of San Luca Sanctuary is a basilica atop the hill above Bologna, dominating the city. You can walk up, better say hike, to it for free through the world's longest archway consisting of 600+ porticos or you can take a few Euros tourist train from the central sq. Being",
          "We took the \u201cSanLuca express\u201d (tourist train from piazza Maggiore) up to the top where the church is which I highly recommend that you do because it is a long way to walk up to the top. We enjoyed the scenery and also the marvelous inside of the church before we walked down the",
          "Took the San Luca express up, then walked down the hill through the porticos. The basilica and surroundings were visually stunning and felt historically and religiously significant. The climb to the top of the basilica should not be missed.",
          "Gorgeous place to visit. Would definitely recommend taking the little train to go and see it. Didn't do the tower view, really didn't feel we needed to. Had hot dogs outside it while waiting for train to return. Lovely experience.",
          "Do not miss this location, the city sees fabulous from there, and the basilica is gorgeous, the ideal place for photos",
          "We were lucky enough to have hotel bikes so we rode to the start of the portico however I wasn't brave enough to attempt the very steep ride up. So we locked my bike at bottom so I could walk while my husband attempted the climb on a city bike (without gears!) that had seen",
          "Visited using the San Luca Express. It was definitely easier than going up to the Sanctuary by foot. Lots of pilgrims visiting at same time. The sanctuary is a lovely sight. Amazing views of Bologna from the top.",
          "We walked from Piazza Maggiore through the portico San Luca with an 11 and 13 year old in 30 degree heat and the last mile uphill was a bit slow as the kids found it warm. The sights are amazing along the way and the church is beautiful. The icon of Madonna was worth the trip",
          "We took the little train to the top and walked down. As you could only buy return tickets we gave our tickets to people who had walked up and were happy to take the train back down. Lovely views from here.",
          "The walk to the church is through a really nice portico, the longest in Europe apparently. It is nearly 3.5kms though and towards the end there are some very steep sections that are stepped, so not really suitable for wheelchairs. I\u2019d definitely advise getting the bus unless you",
          "I did this with my 10 year old and it was quite a hike. But worth it! Tips: comfortable shoes (sneakers), bring plenty of water and wet wipes to wipe off the sweat at the end of the hike. Also, ladies, if you are planning to visit the church at the top, don\u2019t wear shorts and",
          "Hello TA friends, just got back from a visit to SMS way atop Bologna. A few tips: check their hours. After a very very strenuous climb my teens and I were very disappointment that it was closed for lunch. There are no views at all if you cannot get to theSantuario. Next tip: I",
          "Slightly out of the city but worth going to. We took the toy train which was a nice way to see the city and much cooler than walking. However the walking route is covered by porticos all the way, but beware it\u2019s quite a hike due to the incline. Round trip takes c2 hours with",
          "This is a must do for able bodied travelers. A bus no 20 to Saragozza gate and a 45 min walk under the Portico to the top. Lots of walking but away from worst of the heat. Also some good coffee shops and no rip off. A test of fitness too. Church at end of walk cool and calm. A",
          "High on the hills. Beautiful church with spectacular views over Emilio Romagno. Catch the San Luca Express up there though. Some climb otherwise.",
          "We gave in and took the tourist train - quite pricey at 10\u20ac return but takes you to the door from the Piazza Maggiore but there is no alternative unless you take a taxi or walk. At the top the views are very good but as the church was closed we could not go to the viewing point",
          "The Santuario di Madonna di San Luca culminates an extraordinary walk of 3.8kms under the longest covered portico in the world. If you are not up to it, consider a taxi or bus up and the walk down.",
          "This place locate up to the hill, you can walking or cycling or driving up to there If you walk, prepare of your dress and shoes, about 2 km climb up is not easy. Bring your water, beverage with you, there is no store up there When you come up to the top, you will see very good",
          "The church is amazing but it is surpassed by the views of the city and the surrounding hills, especially if you pay the extra \u20ac5 to go up to the roof. We walked from the centre of town and up through the portico, it was worth all of the stairs!",
          "The 10 euro red bus tour ticket allows you to take the express shuttle to this place. There is a commentary along the route but unfortunately it was not working in our part of the trolley on the way up. The road leading up to it is quite steep so unless you are quite fit, I",
          "I took the train up but walked down. I thought that I would stop along the way to have a drink and/or snack (and a rest) but very few places are open on Sunday until you get to central Bologna.",
          "Up the hill, through 666 arches, providing spectacular views around Bologna. Worth paying (5 euros) to take the steps up into the dome (if you are mobile of course). Beautiful church.",
          "Walk the walk if you can. A tough enough climb but under 3.8km of portico - a signature feature of Bologna. Great views from the top. No trip to Bologna is complete without this",
          "This is located on a hill above the city. Lots of steps if you walk up through all the porticos. I took a taxi. The view is well worth the trip up.",
          "We very much enjoyed the opportunity to visit the Sanctuario di Madonna di San Luca while we were staying in Bologna in May 2019. The Basilica di San Luca sits atop Monte del Guardia about 300 meters above Bologna. It is connected to the town below through a remarkable 3.8",
          "To be honest the interior and exterior of this church are good but I have seen much more spectacular in Italy, and especially in Sicily. But what makes a visit here so special is the total package of the Church and the unique climb through over 600 arches of portico with a total",
          "We took the land train up and walked back down. Amazing views from up there. Free to go into the church and paid the \u20ac5 to go up to the top,of the dome. Not for the faint-hearted with a spiral staircase, but several landings for taking a breather. The views were spectacular.",
          "The climb is very long and very steep. If you\u2019re unfit better to take the San Luca express from Piazza Maggiore. Views at the top from both inside & out are magnificent.",
          "This baroque style basilica Church is situated atop Monte Della Guardia, 300 meters above the city. Part of Church was begun in 1193, but the current church was constructed in 1723. The interior of the church was so mesmerizing I can\u2019t count the number of camera shots taken",
          "The walk to this church is awesome through the 3.8Km portico. The church is intricate internally and the climb up 111 steps to the dome viewing platform is a challenge up the spiral steps. A must visit but keep to a fine day to get the best of the countryside views. Access is",
          "With previous mobility issues not yet gone completely my wife and I decided to take the San Luca mini train (return ticket) which took us from the town centre to the Sanctuary. A nice ride and much appreciated as there is a 3-4km walk to get to the top with a good 2 kms being",
          "On of the best city tour visit in Italy surely Is Bologna, for the medieval palaces, for the squares and food, but The \"San Luca Portico\" in wonderful. Yesterday, at the First round of Giro d'Italia, our Mythos Vincenzo Nibali was there.",
          "The church is lovely and the view is spectacular (we even had an opportunity to climb up to the rooftop) but the walk up is something you cannot experience anywhere else in the world! So take your time, wear good walking shoes, bring a bottle of water and enjoy!",
          "Beautiful place not far from town. Either a short drive/bus ride or a bit of a steep walk under nearly 2 km of porticos. Beautiful scenery. Nice views of the city and Colli Bolognesi - the hills around Bologna. Church is beautiful too. The stairs to the roof are narrow but",
          "The best view City of Bologna and country side. If the tower is open, take the chance. And of course, enter in the inside the church to see the details and learn about the history of Bologna arch\u2019s.",
          "Lovely walk to the top of the hill where you'll find a lovely church. Views are great. Walk is sheltered and steep but slow and steady will gett",
          "We took the train from piazza Maggiore and it drops you up at the church and you can get back on the next one. I am so glad we did as it is a long steep walk up the hill.",
          "Three generations climbed up to see the views from the top! Glad my son is a young fit daddy as he had to push & carry the buggy with his three year old daughter in!! It\u2019s a very very long walk & climb but so worth it!! The whole walk from the centre of the city is beneath the",
          "Myself and my mother decided to make the ascent up to San Luca through the UNESCO nominated Porticos. We started off our travels at the Piazza Maggiore making our way through the streets of the inner Bologna city wall before reaching the first of the 666 Porticos. Walking the",
          "We went up on the little train which was a worthwhile trip in itself. The basilica sits beautifully in a rural landscape and if you can brave the staircase a fantastic view There are toilets but very little else as far as amenities, the local restaurant doesn\u2019t open until midday",
          "Decided to walk from Bologna city centre rather than drive, taxis or take the tourist train. It\u2019s about 70mins each way. Walking along the Portico was brilliant - no map needed. It has 471 steps from the Bonaccordi arch to The Sanctuary of Madonna di SanLuca with lots of other",
          "We got a taxi up from the main square, 11 euros, beats the San Luca \u201ctrain\u201c if not walking up.. We walked back down which was pleasant and took a while. Looked like locals on the track don't bother with gym membership. If you are fit and feel you have work off the local",
          "We were advised that the best way to see the Basilica is to take the train from Piazza Maggiore (10\u20ac) and then walk down. That was great advice and we are glad we did this. The train leaves on a regular basis and maps can be obtained at the Visitors Centre in Piazza Maggiore.",
          "Great views back to the city of Bologna. We took the San Luca express up there. Landtrain \u20ac10 each and then \u20ac5 Euros each to climb the 100 stairs to the top. It was closing at 12:30 though so go early or check the opening times b4 you go to avoid disappointment",
          "First of all its outside of the city, you can decide if you take the bus and climb from the bottom or take the car or train from Piatza Majore which drives up directly to the monastry. Its a hike up for 30-60mins depending on your speed. The train is including info from",
          "It was great walking and admiring the architecture of the portico\u2019s (666), to be precise. The Sanctuary itself was worth the visit. But check the hours because during the week it is closed from 12.30-2.30 if i am not wrong. Strongly recommend it.",
          "We had intended to catch the little train from the main piazza to go up and then walk back as previous reviewers have suggested. Sadly, we visited at the very end of the off-peak season so the train only travelled on Monday and Friday. We had arrived late afternoon Monday and",
          "Lovely walk from the centre of Bologna all along the portico\u2019s to Santuario di Madonna di San Luca. Great views of the city. Would say it takes about 2 hours there and back.",
          "It\u2019s located near the city on top of hill .there is an old way for visitors with many stairs.from there you can see Bologna and it\u2019s suburb .fantastic view. You can sit for moments in cathedral. Unfortunately all around are private gardens . Usually there are many Bolognese who",
          "I recently hiked up to this beautiful church. It is indeed a very trying task, there are many steps to go up to get to the church and if one is not in good shape it may be wiser to take the bus from Piazza Maggiore up to the area. The views are very satisfactory although not",
          "The pink basilica is very imposing on the top of a hill overlooking the City, and accessing it by the dedicated train, past the world's longest portico, is a must. Views from the basilica are great, and the inside of the basilica displays some interesting treasures.",
          "Went there to take pictures in the afternoon, a foggy day and the light in the Basilica was very beautiful a..nd going in it was even more beautiful ..seeing all the majestuosity of the church so wonderful Recommended !",
          "We took the land train here. Unfortunately it was a misty day so we could not see the views. Also there was a service and we felt it was not right to walk around in the church whilst this was going on. But what we saw was lovely.",
          "I would have never imagined a Byzantine icon of the 13th century to have been transferred from Constantinople to Bologna! But so has been the history and today you can find an amazing site that is St Luke\u2019s cathedral Surrounded by greenery on a hilltop overlooking Bologna- a",
          "Take the San Luca Express toy train from Piazza Maggiore ( 10 euros) and you get a mini tour of Bologna and then the amazing drive up to the Santuario. There is a portico that stretches all the way up the hill from the city so you could walk but you had better be triathlete fit.",
          "a wonderful walk, fully under the portici, starting from within the town up to the hill, a little outside Bologna. No matter the weather, consider taking this 2-hour walk or look for the bus instead!",
          "The whole point about this place is the walk up the longest colonnade in the world and back down. A must do in Bologna.",
          "We visited riding the little train which felt very touristy but didn't have the energy to walk up thorugh portico, though if you are fit enough I am sure this is the way to do it. We paid 10 euro each for the train and although there was a guided commentary I suspect we could",
          "We had a car and were able to drive up most of the hill, but still had a 10 minute walk up under the porticos. The graffitti on the porticos detracted from the piety of the place. The drawing attributed the evangelist Luke is interesting, and engenders tremendous devotion from",
          "It is absolutely worth walking up to the stairs to the Sanctuary. You can get an amazing view of the landscape that surrounds the city.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, make sure to go early because a little difficult to find parking but otherwise! Go visit!",
          "We behaved like tourists and went up to this Sanctuary on the 'little train' from Piazza S. Maggiore, but walked back down to the city in the 'portico' passage. Good views from the dome, and walking down back to the city was fun, if a little tiring by the end.",
          "I highly recommend walking up to the Santuario di Madonna di San Luca! From the centre of town, the walk is 4km long through the world's longest portico, and includes quite a bit of climbing and stairs in the second half of the walk. But the view from the top is worth it! (Plus",
          "666 arches leading up to the Santuario , and you can walk up, take the San Lica train from Piazza Maggiore or even cheaper is to taxi up! It\u2019s not that spectacular inside and exterior also needs a paintjob, but it is something you have to see whilst in Bologna. Pity you can\u2019t",
          "Great walk with tremendous view, from the city center to the outskirts. Melancholy and rest. Worth seeing and being there!",
          "We first saw this from miles away driving into Bologna. We had no idea what we were looking at. But in the afternoon we took the little tourist train up to the peak and saw this in all its glory. Exterior is exceptional and interior very important for believers. Highly",
          "Either drive or walk up under the portico it's a fabulous view of Bologna. Home to the black Madonna this beautiful church high on the hill is worth a trip!",
          "I used to run up this climb and although it nearly killed me each time due to the steepness my days what a place it is. if you are in visiting Bologna we worth visiting",
          "Not sure the number of steps, but its hundreds. Well worth the effort, what a building and view, a must.",
          "Whoa, this was amazing. Had read about some intrepid soul in the 1930s building a cable car up the steep hill to the summit and Basilica of San Luca only, after public outcry that this circumvented the effort of reachingbthe top to such a sacred place on foot. With this in mind",
          "We were just walking around Piazza Maggiore when we saw the 'Train'. We decided to do the return trip up to San Luca. The recorded information was ok as was the train ride. The trip up to San Luca was good, the return trip was just a case of getting us back to base. If we had",
          "We decided to take the hilarious little Luca Express 'train' which you catch in Piazza Maggiore. In September it was running every hour. It was a hoot compared to walking uphill for 6 plus kilometers. There is time to experience the 666 porticos and view the church. They even",
          "We walked up to the basilica from the centre of Bologna. It is about 3 miles so, if you\u2019re doing it from the Centre, wear comfortable shoes. It is all under porticoes so sun exposure is not a problem. En route there are several Mysteries which are paintings depicting scenes from",
          "It\u2019s not so much the Basilica itself that makes this a \u2018must do\u2019 when in Bologna, it\u2019s more the walk under 666 porticos (yes, deliberately the devil\u2019s number, apparently.) which form an under cover serpentine corridor that can be attempted in all weathers. At the 666th portico",
          "I highly recommend walking up to this church since it is a great walk and you do get good view at the top but the most amazing thing is that the portico which starts from the outskirts of Bologna and lead all the way to the church. It is so beautiful. It took us around 2 hours",
          "You can walk all the way to this beautiful church of San Luca under porticoes but it\u2019s a long walk so we took a cab. We found when we got there that you can also get a bus. The views are stunning and the church itself lovely. There was a mass on at the time we were there on",
          "You can catch the San Luca express up and back or be brave and walk it but whatever you do, take the trouble to go here. Great views of Bologna and the surrounding countryside. The church is deeply moving. The 660 portici are worth experiencing- just do it!!",
          "Was planning to walk up the hill through the porticos but decided to take the San Luca express. Great view from the top of the hill and the church is beautiful. I can understand for some that are not Catholic it may not be worth it but I enjoyed it very much. Another chance",
          "I wouldn't climb this mountain to get here, as some people did, but I would take the \"car-train\" again. You can catch this ride in the center of town, near City Hall. It's worth going up, even if you don't go into San Luca, because you can overlook the city of Bologna and the",
          "We took the \u201chop-on/hop-off\u201d bus (from the Piazza Maggiore) which took us all the way up to this beautiful sanctuary. It is situated on a hilltop with breathtaking views of the city and there is also a covered walkway all the way to the bottom. The church itself is also",

          "After hearing about the world\u2019s longest Portico and the Sanctuary at the top I wanted to give it a go. Alas, I decided to take the San Luca Express from the Piazza Maggiore. Your ticket is a return. It was a great decision as 1. I saw a part of Bologna that I would have not",
          "I enjoyed my climb from Bologna to San Luca, but it's not for the out-of-shape. It also requires a several hour time commitment to get there and back. The sanctuary is beautiful and peaceful and the icon is quite beautiful and interesting. If you don't want to hike up, there",
          "don't get me wrong, you get to the church and have stunning view of Bologna, but you can get really great views from within Bologna without having to travel to Santuario for another aspect. We took the tourist train from the palazzo and that was the best bit of the trip as we",
          "Great views over the city. The climb is quite steep and worth avoiding on a hot day but there is a frequent tourist train. It is worth paying the 5 EUR to go the top , but it is a narrow staaircase with people going both ways",
          "Santuario di Madonna di San Luca is a local pilgrimage where Catholics go to pray. It is located on the top of the hill just in the outskirts of Bologna and you can go there, either on foot, following a long arcade or by bus. According to the legend, a miracle happened when",
          "This historic shrine is reputed to hold a painting of the Virgin Mary! But most people go there because it's so high up over the city of Bologna. There is a winding and steep climb from the city but taxis and tour buses go there, too. Some people were walking the day we went",
          "After a busy morning of walking and site seeing in central Bologna we took the San Luca Express up the hill to the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca. We watched folks walking up the hill through the porticoes in the heat and were glad we took the train. The church inside is",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this church, which was free of admission charge. We intended to approach via the famous portico but accidentally took a rather longer route winding up the hillside. We were rewarded with impressive views of the basilica coming in to view and a rather nice",
          "Really nice place (which we can achieve by taking the city bus 58 -1,30\u20ac). But i think the 5\u20ac view is really not a to do thing, no real view to the city.",
          "There is a long winding and steep road from the city to the top of the hill that houses this shrine. Some were walking \u2014 very slowly. A taxi ride is suggested for most. The local tour train also goes there for 6 euro from the main square. The chapel is pretty and peaceful. The",

          "The church itself is worth seeing but I feel that some of the works (particularly the Guido Reni) need restoration as it is very dark and you cannot see much detail. There is a 5 Euro charge to visit the terrace which is up on the cupola. 110 narrow steps I believe and the",
          "Highly recommend taking the tourist train to the top. You can get the train in the main square. The walk up can be a bit much, particularly in the heat. Walking around the church area is lovely, and it\u2019s a little walk uphill to reach the church. You can climb the tower if you",
          "I took a trip up on the St. Luca Express, which was great because it's a LONG way uphill. Great views, not worth staying around for too long, though. Twenty minutes is more than enough. You can walk all the way down from the hill on the longest portico in the world...people walk",
          "You will need to walk a reasonable distance from central Bologna to reach the Santuario Madonna di San Luca, including a few km up hill, however it is worth it. Fantastic views over the city and the surrounding hills. the covered pathway is busy on weekends, often with joggers.",
          "We took the miniature train rather that endure the very long walk and were glad. You get to see views throughout Bologna as well a great scenery on the way. The climax is the very beautiful and secluded Church of the Madonna of St Luca. There are numerous viewing positions on",
          "Breathtaking views of the city, gorgeous architecture. I just wish I had more time to visit the entire sanctuary or attend Mass. We did happen to have dinner at a nearby restuarant that was absolutely charming brimming with locals and some tourists. Our waiter spoke some",
          "Went up to the Basilica by the San Luca express Train, return journey per person was \u20ac10, which was great, you get headphones and audio. Basilica was beautiful and we lucked out as there was a service going on as we arrived. And extra \u20ac5 each allowed us to climb the spiral",
          "I am not religious but love going there. There is such an energy, a view of nature and the colors are so beautiful that everytime and regardless of the season, I have a great experience. Very spiritual. I recommend doing the steps, at last one way.",
          "It is a long walk going up. The covered portico offers some protection from the sun but the walk is still exhilarating. We needed to catch our breath on the way up but was rewarded with nice views of the city. The Bologna airport is visible as well. Worth the long walk.",
          "The walk to this place is quite hard, but it\u2019s beautiful, and totally worth it. At the top you can pay to go to the dome, and have a 180 degree view (east, south, west). Saw a mess at the church. Would recommend my friends to see this place.",
          "If you are in the area and want some great views then its worth a trip or hike to the top! inside is calm and beautiful",
          "Having done the cycle tour and then walked up the tower, we cheated and took the tourist train and walked back. Great views of the city and an amazing feat of engineering. Difficult not to count the arches on the way back and make sure you take a bottle of water. Hats off to",
          "This church is beautiful. At the end of a long colonnade, and a strenuous enough climb, the church and surrounding did not disappoint. Overlooking Bolonga and the surrounding countryside the view was spectacular. I would highly recommend a visit. It can be accessed by road but",
          "If you want to see the city from afar this is a good site but the building itself has seen better times and there is nothing else to see or do. The church itself is not as impressive as many of those in the city. We got the tourist train which was novel but full and not very",
          "We visited this Santuario di Madonna di San Luca during June 2018. There is not lots to see inside and it is all very standard, and I found the staff very unwelcoming. The views outside are beautiful and we were glad we visited. We used the car/train and it is only a brave soul",

          "We decided to catch a taxi and walk back from this wonderful basilica. For \u20ac5 ea you can climb the narrow winding staircase to the top for the most amazing views over Bologna and surrounding area. Beautiful building and a lovely walk back down in the covered archways. Definitely",
          "I'm 65 years old, I've had 2 stents in my heart, and 4 knee surgeries. I've made this vigorous and awesome trek twice in 2 years and it is so worth the climb. The views are stunning, the Sanctuary exquisite and the sense of accomplishment is overwhelming. An absolute must do!",
          "Nice 2 hour trip with beautiful views. Very interesting and added the walk up 150 or so narrow spiral staircase at 5eu was worth it for the view",
          "We are old fogeys, OK? That means we don't do long walks and boy would this be a long walk from the centre of Bologna to the Santuario, up very steep steps. We went by train and passed youngsters who seemed to be flagging. Very impressive portico on the way up and nice church",
          "I didn't want to ride a cheesy tourist train (San Luca Express) up to the church but I also did not want to walk uphill for nearly 3.5 km either. We did take The Express when I noticed it was a small bus rather than the train (which fortunately broke down). You catch the",
          "Whilst it is possible to drive right up to the basilica the best experience is to walk up the long portico which winds up the hill. We got a number 20 bus to the Arco del Meloncello at the foot of the hill which cuts out the flat leg. The views from the top are superb on a clear",
          "Not sure why all the hype - views from around church not so good apart from countryside. Nice church but nothing else to do whilst waiting for the bus back especially if early in the day and the restaurant across from the bus stop not open - opens at midday. Trip up in the bus",
          "Great views. Pretty good place to relax from the hustle and the bustle of the city of Bologna. The highlight was finding a sour plumb tree at the bus stop and picking a few for my wife who loves them.",
          "Yes it is a hike, especially in the high twenties we've had in the past few days: yes your legs will ache - you are walking 2.3km each way, if you can do it under your own steam (i.e. don't use the bus from the centre or the tourist train). There are 666 (yes really!) arches",
          "This is well worth the visit just for the journey alone and the great views. We would have walked under the porticos to San Luca but it was about 3 or 4 kilometres and my team mate had a bad knee so we took the tourist train from Piazza Maggiore which costs 10 euros and takes",
          "At first I thought it would be difficult to walk the distance from the city to the Santuario, but it was not that hard. We arrived much sooner than expected. Many people do this on Sundays as an exercise. We climbed the stairs to the dome of the church, paying 5 euro for",
          "I cannot understand reviews praising this place - maybe they are from people who love religious shrines or who enjoy punishing themselves as part of their fitness regime. As a simple tourist who has visited many holy places and climbed many hills I was totally disappointed by",
          "Beautiful views overlooking the city, but a tense drive up the one lane road. It would be a long walk, and a steep bike ride up, but the views are lively",
          "Stunning. The climb from the city centre was worth while. The views are breath taking. Highly recommend the walk and not to take Public transport. Absolute lovely building.",
          "The view from this church is absolutely beautiful! You can walk, take a taxi or the little tourist train The San Luca Express. The little train is fun and you see other areas of Bologna on your way",
          "The views of the country side are breathtaking. It is one of those things that you just have to do, if one wants to live a life well lived. I mean, there is so much beauty in Italy and this is definitely one to behold. I cheated and went up in a car but I imagine that the trek",
          "Starting from central Bologna we took the numbered porticos (666 of them) up to San Luca. The walk itself is mainly up hill with plenty of places to stop and rest. Would highly recommend having water with you and expect the climb to take approx 1 hour. You will be walking on",
          "My wife and I have been to Bologna three times. And, on the first day of each trip, we have gone to the Santuario di Madonna di San Luca. It is a wonderful way to help rid yourself of jet lag. The church itself sits atop a hill on the outskirts of the original walled city of",
          "We visited San Luca with the aid of a small train from the centre of town. A super location with great views and with a beautiful restaurant at the top.",
          "There are many ways to get on top of Bologna. You may climb the road of the pilgrims, take the public transportation or drive your own car - no matter how you decide to make the journey, make sure to have time to visit this magnificent building when you are in town.",
          "An excellant place to visit if you have the time it it a very long long walk if you want to save your energy take the San Express from Piazza Maggore to the bottom of the hill leaving just the climb to the top where you visit the basilica check nfor times of last journey",
          "It\u00b4s a nice Basilica for sure, but the \"SkyExperience\" was the height of the visit. For a donation of 5 Euro you get to climb the 110 steps to a platform outside the dome. They say it\u00b4s the highest located dome in Europe. You get a 180 degree stunnig view over the surrounding",
          "This is a beautiful church located on top of a hill overlooking Bologna. You can drive or walk up the stairs, about a twenty minute hike to the top. Well worth the effort to visit.",
          "I'm so glad we decided to jump on the San Luca express and visit the sanctuary while in Bologna. The ride up there was very interesting, don't think I could have walked it all. The building is so just draw dropping, built for giants and not just mere mortals.",
          "This is worth a visit whatever the weather as you're in a covered portico all the way. In fact it's the longest continuous covered portico in the world. Quite a climb but well worth it.",
          "The colonnades take you from the town, wide up a hill to a beautiful chapel far above the hustle and bustle of the city. Be prepared for a 3 km walk each way once you leave the city. The climb is not arduous and the reward of a magnificent setting makes it very worthwhile.",
          "The walk up is long and steep in parts. I'd recommend taking the \"train\" from piazza Maggiore up and walking back down into turn - same views. There is no true 360 degree view from the top, there is no full access to the side that overlooks Bologna. Still a good view of the city",
          "It's a long walk, sometimes a very gradual slope sometimes steps. It's worth taking the time and seeing the city views. Take water, there's nothing along the way. The views at the top are lovely. It's peaceful and when we were there not busy although the church was closed. It's",
          "San Luca is a must see in Bologna. I would recommend to walk through the Porticos to the top to fully enjoy the architecture and the surroundings. We walked through via Saragoza to the end and followed the portico until we reached the top. You can also take the San Luca Express",
          "This is really worth a visit as the view is spectacular. It's worth paying to go up the tower as it's not too difficult (and the steps are not too enclosed if you suffer from claustrophobia as I do - easily manageable). The area is lovely. I would recommend the tourist land",
          "We took the bus trip and after 658 continuous porticos were pleased that we had chosen to do so. The building, at the top of a hill, was imposing, both externally and internally, unfortunately shrouded in mist on the morning of our visit - On a clear day the views over the city",
          "Took the Santa Lucy Express (small road train from Piazza Maggiore at 10 Euros per person) as opposed to walking the 3 miles or so from the city centre. Very imposing landmark but check opening times if you want to go inside (closed when we got there and staff on the Express",
          "On the last day of the visit we walked from the center of town up to San Luca and what an experience. The walk is steep and long - 2.3 miles but it's worth it. The views going up and when you reach the top are breath taking.",
          "We started in the city and walked through the 666 Poticos and a 3.5k uphill to St Luca. The church is lovely and apparently your wishes are granted if you make one however, be warned the church closes at certain times so check these out before making the journey. It was cool",
          "Simply magnificent. Incredible views of Bologna. Old church with exquisite art to include the Black Madonna. A must see!",
          "This places offers everthing; amazing views of the mountains and also a sacres place to visit. Highly recommended",
          "We took the tourist train from Piazza Maggiore and enjoyed every moment of it. The view from the church was great. Also, the portico from the city to the church is unique",
          "We took the tourist train to Santuario di Madonna di San Luca, but many people walk the distance along the portico; it's steep, particularly at the end. The reward is a beautiful church with spectacular views of Bologna on one side and the rolling hills of the countryside on",
          "We walked through all 666 porticos up to Madonna di San Luca with beautiful views once at the top. An interesting experience",
          "A beautiful place you should visit in this to town. You can go by touristic train, by bus or by walking...if you can handle it.....",
          "Be prepared for a lot of steps. Interesting experience. Views are not of Bologna city but rather the countryside.",
          "Go through the gates and Via Saragozza and follow the 660 gates to San Luca as a 3 mile mini-pilgrimmage. The church it self is pretty but not more than others, but the view of Bologna is still great. Definitely a must do, but do it for the journey and enjoy this part.",
          "Reasonably hard work up the steps to the church. A mile or so and fair elevation gain. Limited view of Bologna, but on some days you can get in the church tower (5 Euro).",
          "You can get a tourist train or express bus from piazza maggiore if you don't fancy the walk up to San Luca. It's not that difficult but personally a bit boring. You can't see much, as for the main you ar alongside a road. There are shops etc in the lower porticos but once you",
          "We got the tourist train to the Santuario and then walked back to the town through the portico which almost goes all the way back to the Piazza Maggiore, amazing structure with hundreds of people walking, running , staggering , in the opposite direction from the city up to the",
          "Fantastic views, well worth the hike, took less time than you would think so don't be disheartened. The building looks spectacular:)",
          "Pretty place. Take the walk up there but be prepared to swet and have sore legs the day afterwards. We walked down through the landscape on the back side on the way home. It was quiet and beautiful as well.",
          "Although the sanctuary is a beautiful place itself, I mostly enjoyed the walk along the San Luca portico which is 3.5 km long 660 arches and, luckily, there were some chapels to stop and admire as some parts of the stairs were a bit exhausting. There were lots of walkers and",
          "A longish walk or you could get a bus, or the tourist train. Well worth a visit. Fantastic views of Bologna and surrounding countryside.",
          "We took the little train out to the Basilica as it came highly recommended in our guide book. We were not warned either by information in the book or the guide on the little train that just as we were arriving the doors would be shut for two hours for lunch and that there would",
          "the view from the top is worth the walk! A lovely sunday morning walk, mostly uphill, along with all the locals doing their walking/jogging up to San Luca.",
          "We were given the wrong directions and consequently walked for ages but when we got there it was worth it because the views are great, you didn\u00b4t need to spend much time there so if you can i would recommend the walk or the small train. We ate at the only restaurant there which",
          "If you're not planning to walk up Don't take the train. It will be the same price and much faster if you go with a taxi",
          "San Luca sanctuary is one of the most famous and most beautiful places in Bologna. San Luca is situated on one of the highest hill around the city at the end of the longest \"portico\" of the world (portico Di San Luca built from 1674 to 1721 DC). From there you can see an",
          "San Luca is one of the first sites you see as you fly into bologna from the north or drive into the city or come in by train. It is on the rise to the east from the north. You can get there by public bus or by the tour \"buses\" -- the red bus or the train bus. Whether to want",
          "We hiked here on a Sunday and while it's not an easy walk, the structure is very beautiful. Definitely worth the trip. Just avoid eating at the food truck there. Worst panini ever!",
          "This is the one to do when visiting Bologna. You can either get the tourist train up and walk down and pick up the bus at the bottom, or become a real pilgrim and walk up and down. The Church is magnificent.",
          "If you are only two days in bologna, you should really walk on this hill to have a good view over Bologna, and at the same time to this great monarchy!! The walk up to the hill is long, and very long if you didn't expect such a walk like me ;-) But after all I enjoyed it very",
          "We went up on the tourist train and walked back through all the porticos. Be aware that there is nothing else to do around the area once you have visited the Santuario.",
          "this beautiful church is out side the city on a hill with views of the city all around this is a must see on your visit to Bologna",
          "We walked from the historic Centre of Bologna to the top and it took is about an hour and half. Once you go through the Portico de Saragozza you follow the Portico the whole way. Firstly this is along the road then you begin the ascent up towards the Basilica. This is a",
          "Start down at the Porta Saragozza and walk along the 666 porticos up to the San Luca. Great walk that offers brilliant views. It is not for the unfit and take some water as on a hot day you'll need it. There is nothing available when you reach the santuary at the top.",
          "Quite a climb up a 2.3km long portico walk to reach the Santuario. Well worth the effort. Took about 75 mins to walk up. There was a service going on when we reached the church at the top so we watched from the back of the church for a while. Pity there is not a",
          "This is a must, I won't lie though, the walk up is a tad energetic but worth it. Take water and your time, ignore the maniacs running up and down! The chiesa is simple but restful. Views at the top are ok but the best are on the way down - stunning over the city and countryside.",
          "Whilst this is a every impressive basilica, it probably isn't worth spending a morning or afternoon going up there. The journey there, though is much better. The best way is to walk the 3.8Km through the portico gallery is spectacular, but is quite steep. Alternatively, you can",
          "We did not want to walk for an hour to the basilica so took the train bus to go up there. It is really good option for sightseeing of the city streets. The architecture both outside and inside is amazing and of course has a nice view of the city.I expected a legendary view",
          "It's a hell of a walk but it's really worth the effort! You could take the tourist train/bus if you are feeling lazy :-) It's certainly an experience, the walk along, through and up and up and up the 3km Portico di San Luca!! It did take us about 50 mins. The views are great",
          "I had read that this was a pilgrimage site, but I hadn\u2019t imagined that hundreds of people would be climbing the 666 steps to the top of the hill, a stiff climb even though they were sheltered by a colonnade. I opted for the #58 city bus, more like a large van. (A regular bus",
          "Beautiful church with stunning views of the city of Bologna. It can actually be accessed by walking under the arcades all the way from downtown Bologna. Would not recommend for people out of shape. Beautiful architecture.",
          "We took the touristt train from the centre I recommend this unless you are particularly fit and llooking for a work out before you arrive! I was surprised to see elderly visitors walking up the sheltered walkway to the basilica. Perhaps this is a form of penance? The church is",
          "We took the 20 bus to the foot of the hill and walked the 2 kms up through the covered walkway. Good exercise! The church at the top is beautiful, as are the views. There are a couple of well hidden snack dispensers with water and biscuits if you have the need. There are",
          "Venue closed for lunch but the walk there was amazing! It was a beautiful sunny day and the walk (which makes you work hard) was a great antidote to the wonderful food in Bologna. Wear comfortable shoes and take water. Better still get someone to carry you!",
          "It is well worth the effort as the portici are so protective. The stations of the rosary accompany you on the way and that makes it more sacred. The church is very welcoming and the view over Bologna is stunning. The church closes from 12.30 till 14.30 so time your visit.",
          "You need to be fit to arrive here. Prepare to 30-40 minutes walking by via Saragozza or 20 mins running, in fact is a perfect destination for jogging. The view on Bologna from up above is amazing. A peaceful beautiful cathedral in the middle of the nature.",
          "and good walking shoes. It was a LONG hard walk, continually uphill/steps (loads). This is NOT for the faint hearted. I thought there may have been a view from the top, but no view, well there is a view but not worth that climb! Take a picnic and drinks, you will need them",
          "We took the city tour,on a great scenery,take a close look to the church,leave the bus,and if you are ok with walking,go on your feet,its almost 1.5hours of walk to city center",

          "You just have to make the effort to walk the 2 kilometres of portico ed terracing to this special site and enjoy the wonderful views. Really worth the effort. Catch the number 20 bus from Rizzoli",
          "You better do it by foot. Walking is good for the soul and for that view is totally worthwhile. They have a machine inside the church in different languages so you can hear the history behind the construction.",
          "lovely place and view, we extremely enjoyed the trip there, even if we were unlucky and the church was closed. we did not do it, but i think it is even better going there by wakking, under the beautiful portico going all the way up. it is not too long and definitely ok for",

          "We lived in Bologna for 3 years a couple of blocks from the San Luca steps and running up and down was my exercise with my husband! Now I go up to San Luca to relax, and enjoy the amazing view and peace from up there. It's not an easy way up for a lot of people, but take your",
          "We took the tourist train up to San luca. Beautiful view of the city. Unfortunately it was closed that day - check opening times. We wanted to walk down the 3.7km of Porticos that were built especially to carry the Madonna. Well worth the trip. The porticos have been",

          "This building is found on the north east border of the town. But when you go to it be aware that there is a long climb to the top. The covered walkway runs at about a 40 degree incline and is about a mile long. The views of Bologna are beautiful. The basilica at the top is",
          "While I decided not to walk up the hill under the portico, I did descend back down into Bologna, so that has to count for something, right? It's a long walk on tired feet, so be prepared whether you walk one way or both. (Take the San Luca Express from Piazza Maggiore if you",

          "This is quite a hike. Says just under 4 kilometres but does not tell you that 3 of them are all up hill with lots s steps (make torri degli asinelli seem easy). Some great views when up there, would I say worth the hike, well if you want to work up an appetite yes\ud83d\ude00",
          "Every year I climb the steps to this church. It is a beautiful and historic walk with its extended portici from the city. The views are wonderful from the top and one feels like a true pilgrim once you have reached the end of the covered walkway.",
          "Beautiful and part of the experience it will be nice to walk up to San Luca. It require a bit of strength , willing and a bottle of water to climb :) San Luca inside is amazing. You will have a nice view from the top of the hill. Most important do not forget your camera :)",
          "We travelled up on the San Luca Express (little tourist bus in the shape of a train) then viewed this beautiful basilica before walking back down through the 600+ porticos and into the city again. The porticos are wonderful and there's a great view of the football stadium whilst",

          "In November mist clings to the hill like a warm blanket. Climbing under the 666 arched world record breaking portico was an experience not to be forgotten. The Church was closed when we arrived at 12.33 but an extreme picnic made up for that. Check opening times before",
          "This is the reason we visited Bologna (and the food) 3.8 km to get to the top but sooooo worth it. Views would be magnificent on a clear day too !!",
          "We walked all the way from our hotel to the top, which was very nice but at times hard. The amazing thing, which I did not know, is that Bologna has so many 'arches' and the few kilometres you walk under covered walkway so there is no excuse to walk up the hill even if it is",

          "We drove up here from the centre of Bologna, and it took about 15 minutes to navigate the windy, scenic roads. The views from the top are incredible, especially of the surrounding countryside. If you want to get the best views of the \u2026",
          "An amazing place not to miss once in Bologna... quit... beautiful... peaceful... it brings joy and peace to your soul ....",

          "Great workout going up and down the hill but the church itself is nothing special. There's absolutely nothing around, not even a toilet or a kiosk to buy water. Smh.",
          "A beautiful and historic church located outside of Bologna. We took the local city bus to visit here, with the journey and accompanying audio guide being very good. The church itself was closed when we arrived so we explored the grounds \u2026",
          "Awesome place. Worth a visit. If you are going on foot then it\u2019s about 1 hour to climb to the top. We noticed there is a Sam Luca express tourist \u2018train\u2019 which takes you right at the top and back as well..I read somewhere it charges 10 euros per person but cannot confirm.",
          "This is the best way to view Bologna. I recommend the sky tour. It takes you up to the top of the cathedral. You will then have the best vantage point over the city. It cost us 5 euros each at the time. Well worth a look at. Its also quite a walk, so I recommend taking the bus or if you have a car you can drive.",
          "The view from up here is very good, and the church is not bad looking at all. Taking the route through the portici is also very healthy and pleasant.",

          "Almost 4 kms walk uphill under the arcades: a nice walk you cannot miss whatever is the weather! In a short path you'll see all Bologna from above and the ancient  Byzantine Madonna to whom people from Bologna ask for miracles! And it often works!!!",
          "What a great trek from the city of Bologna. Also, if you want to explore the surrounding hills, head past San Lucca down the road and you\u2019ll come across some cool older farm houses, a gorgeous park and then you come to a little town and \u2026",

          "Stunning views from the top.A hard long walk up but well worth it",
          "This was an wonderful experience. An experience we will never forget. My wife and I walked from the centre of Bologna through the kilometres of porticoes. Not an easy walk, 2 km uphill, but very memorable.",
          "Great view from the top! We drove up and parked - however there is an amazing walkway up too from the city which take about 1 hour return if you are able to climb up!\n\nAlso worth climbing up to the tower for a small fee of 5 euros. Great views of the city from the dome.",
          "One would expect to see some really nice views of Bologna from here, but the reality is the views from the top are quite disappointing. Also one has to pay to get in to the church. The most interesting thing is the journey to the top all within a covered portico, describe does the longest in the world.",
          "Stunning building.  Good hike up, driving or busing is possible.  5 Euros to go on top of building to overlook Bologna and countryside.  Beautiful views, but only worth it on a clear day.",
          "Very lovely place. Good for those who want to propose for their partner in life. A very high place with a nice scenery. Highly recommended for field trip, excursion, and training area for marathon and cycling. Your stay here is worth the time you spend going up the n this high place.

          "Fantastic view as you can imagine. You can get an even better one by climbing to the top of the monument. They charge 10 euros for this and the view is 180 degrees not 360, but worth it for sure. The climb up is through a narrow spiral \u2026",

At the church is now Gorgeouse Christmas Crib. When there is good weather, you can enter the terrace (5\u20ac) and see Bologne from the hill.",

          "Great walk up. Not for the faint hearted. Get the local bus down for 6\u20ac if you don't fancy the long walk back down. Views are a bit rubbish from the top, didn't pay to go in or to.the top of the basilica, I imagine views may be better go \u2026",
          "The dome view is a huge fraud. They are sellingling 5 Euros ticket for 360 degrees view and when you are there the main entrance to the dome circular path is locked and you can see a tiny fraction of view. Of course nobody cares about it. Only if they open main dome it is OK. The portico is astonishing.",
          "Beautiful, beautiful place just outside the city center. If you have the time to walk all the way up through the arches, I highly recommend it. However, it could be crowded during the weekend.",

The top has a beautiful church, a terrace with great views, a gift shop, and an opportunity to see the city from the tip top. A must visit while in Bologna for fit travelers.",

          "Hefty walk up there, be prepared for about 30-40 minutes of uphill walking. The walkway is covered with porticos so it's good to do in the rain, though the view from the top would be a lot better in nice clear weather.\n\nMy partner and I did feel that once up there, there wasn't much to do.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Two Towers (Italian: Le due torri), both of them leaning, are the symbol of Bologna, Italy, and the most prominent of the Towers of Bologna. They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (mura dei torresotti). The taller one is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda. Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited with having been constructed between 1109 and 1119. Their construction was a competition between the two families to show which was the more powerful family. However, the scarcity of documents from this early period makes this in reality rather uncertain. The name of the Asinelli family, for example, is documented for the first time actually only in 1185, almost 70 years after the presumed construction of the tower which is attributed to them.\n\n\n== Asinelli Tower ==\n\nIt is believed that the Asinelli Tower initially had a height of ca. 70 m and was raised only later to the current 97.2 m (with an overhanging battlement of 2.2 m). In the 14th century the city became its owner and used it as a prison and small stronghold. During this period a wooden construction was added around the tower at a height of 30 m above ground, which was connected with an aerial footbridge (later destroyed during a fire in 1398) to the Garisenda Tower. Its addition is attributed to Giovanni Visconti, Duke of Milan, who allegedly wanted to use it to control the turbulent Mercato di Mezzo (today via Rizzoli) and suppress possible revolts. The Visconti had become the rulers of Bologna after the decline of the Signoria of the Pepoli family, but were rather unpopular in the city.\nSevere damage was caused by lightning that often resulted in small fires and collapses, and only in 1824 was a lightning rod installed. The tower survived, however, at least two documented large fires: the first in 1185 was due to arson and the second one in 1398 has already been mentioned above.\nThe Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli (in 1640) and Giovanni Battista Guglielmini (in the following century) for experiments to study the motion of heavy bodies and the earth rotation. In World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: During bombing attacks, four volunteers took post at the top to direct rescue operations to places hit by Allied bombs. Later, a RAI television relay was installed on top. Architect Minoru Yamasaki is thought to have been inspired by the Towers when designing the World Trade Center during the 1960s.\n\n\n== Garisenda Tower ==\nThe Garisenda Tower today has a height of 48 m with an overhang of 3.2 m. Initially it was approximately 60 m high, but had to be lowered in the 14th century due to a yielding of the ground which left it slanting and dangerous. In the early 15th century, the tower was bought by the Arte dei Drappieri, which remained the sole owner until the Garisenda became municipal property at the end of the 19th century.\nIt was cited several times by Dante in the Divine Comedy and The Rime (a confirmation of his stay in Bologna), and by Goethe in his Italian Journey. The Two Towers have also been the subject of an eponymous poem by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci as part of the Barbarian Odes. Charles Dickens wrote about the towers in his Pictures from Italy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "It\u2019s hard not to see the two towers if you are in the old center of Bologna. They are equally stunning from a distance or up close.",
          "This is one of the remaining towers of Bologna. Wonderful to walk past and a great meeting point. Love the area surrounding the tower as well.",
          "This outing is definitely not for anyone with mobility or health problems. There are 498 steep wooden steps to the top and no lift ! However, there are platforms at intervals on the way up to enable you to take a breather ! The views from the top make the effort worthwhile and",
          "We did not climb the towers but did photograph the towers. The towers appeared to be leaning at an angle to each other from the outside and created an unique composition. It is hard to miss.",
          "This is not for the infirm, 498 steps to the top. The hard part is getting the ticket, not in the door, but from the tourist office in the main square. However I believe you can buy online which I think would be easier as the tourist office was so disorganised and waited ages.",
          "You have to climb 498 steps on a wooden staircase to 'heaven', it's not difficult but can be tough on a hot day. After 15' you reach the top with a beautiful view of Bologna, you have 15' to enjoy the views and after that you can start your way back on the stairs.",
          "The climbing seems to last forever but the steps aren\u2019t as tight as some of the towers I\u2019ve climbed. The steps themselves get more narrow towards the top which proved to be problematic for my large feet coming down. I had to adjust my feet angle to an outward duck walk and was",
          "We tried to get tickets on mobile site, but Flash or some other system compatability was causing issues with the site. By the time we got there (6:32pm, for a Tower advertising it was open until 7pm) they told us sorry you have to return tomorrow. They make the last time slot",
          "Paid \u20ac5 each which we thought was a bargain to climb the 500 steps to the top. The flooring inside is deceiving with a loss of stairs leading to a floor. Each time to got towards the floor you think you\u2019re at he top... you\u2019re not. Four floors later you finally are, and then the",
          "500 steps but they keep numbers tight and as long as you are reasonably fit this is a good attraction to do. It is an amazing old tower and the engineering behind it very impressive. Great views of the lovely city of Bologna as well.",
          "About 500 steps to climb to the top, all woodden and a little precarious looking if you are a nervous climber like me, but I didn't look down and it was worth the effort to see the top and the view.",
          "Glad I did it. Booking essential, but quick, easy and cheap to do online. Entry was for 3.30 pm, waited in line for a few minutes, and at 3.25 we all started walking up the 500 wooden steps to reach the top. I recommend that if you are fit, that you arrive early before your",
          "This isn't very expensive which is good. It wasn't hard to climb because people were moving slow, but once you got to the top everyone was just crowding the viewpoints and not even looking out, just chatting and hanging out on the window ledges! Coming down was quite sketchy as",
          "You need to pre book to get a ticket to climb the stairs of the tower. This is easily done on line and costs Eur 5 per person. The steps are quite small, but steep in places. We did not find it difficult but some did so a certain level of fitness is required. Coming down",
          "I think these towers are definitely a must as you have a great view over Bologna. But to be honest the stairs are frightening. The way up was really exhausting so you can\u2019t concentrate on the construction of the stairs, but on the way down you can and for me it was quite",
          "Our boys really (10, 8 and 6) really enjoyed the climb up the tower. Our youngest told passport control it was the best part of his holiday going up the 498 steps! Views are really good and the times slots work well so it\u2019s not too crowded.",
          "Climbing the tower was not really easy with this warm weather ... all this steps ... but at the end the view of the city is delightful ! A must do in Bologne !",
          "Nice to see, it's in a fun area. Lots of other stuff to see and do. Great vibes. Can get super busy during weekends.",
          "Stayed in private apartment in Via Galliera, 15 minutes walk from train station and 10 minute walk to centre of the old town. town is lively, big buildings, narrow streets so not many views. If you are fit, climb the 498 steps of the tall tower then brave the contractors\u2019 lift",
          "The view once you go to the top is very nice ! There are a lot of stairs and if is crowded you need to wait for all to get up and after start to descend. Also is a bit hot in august so take some water with you. Anyway, a great view of the city :)",
          "What a landmark, the 2 watchtowers wending their way skywards. Reading up on the history of the towers is a must.",
          "Brilliant view from the top. Remember you have to have a ticket before you can climb - 498 steps up and then again down. Suggest you do it when it is cooler - not 38 degrees and humid. Very well organised and very safe.",
          "Built in 1109, one of two side by side leaning towers. Despite her noble age and her noticeable lean, you can climb to the top of the Torre degli Asinelli and enjoy the unique viewpoint and panorama that enfolds before you. Ready to be amazed? Just 498 stairs and you will get a",
          "Two things Bologna is easy recognizable for: these towers and hundreds of arches. Being easily spotted soaring high in the sky the Torris are the most famous landmark. They date back to medieval times, when each richer family built its own, so there were dozens, maybe hundred",
          "You MUST climb the tower if you are able. The view is unbelievable. Not great for young children, as the staircase is open and we were uncomfortable with our youngest - she and my husband only went to the first landing at about 30m. Otherwise fantastic!",
          "Impossible to come to Bologne and you do not visit the twin tower. I do not yet find some place for taking a nice picture covering totally both tower.",
          "Dont go here if you are unfit, scared of enclosed spaced, heights etc. We are rather well travelled but this place is very VERY rickety. It was a miserable day so the views were not very good and if you are having a heart attack then the defibrillator is on the top floor \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.",
          "There are two towers to see - one is the smaller leaning tower and the other is the one that you can climb. It costs 5 euros per person and you can book online to choose a time. We found the queue wasn't very long when we went around 1pm however that may have been due to the 35",
          "Bologna claim to fame apart from oldest university in Europe is the Due torri. Two towers (used to be dozens) usual story about politics and power. One leans the other doesn\u2019t. Yawn!",
          "I went to Bologna with my girlfriend and one of the first things we did was to climb the towers. An incredible romantic view over the red-orange-shaded city appeared in front of us. Just unforgettable. It is really worth it! Lots of stairs are to be climbed but they were fun.",
          "No doubt that those towers are the city\u2019s ex-libris. If the smaller tower already calls your attention what can be said about the bigger one which is almost 100 meters high! Not to forget that both are middle age buildings; their inclination is an attractive. Enjoy!",
          "built in the 12th century at the entrance to the city by two families of the same name, i believe it was a bit of a power struggle to see who could build the tallest tower,",
          "We purchased the tickets a few weeks before and climbed this tower on a tropical day. You go up together with all the persons who have tickets for that specific time. And afterwards you go down. I think you get around 45 minutes total. So although the stairs are a bit small at",
          "It is not often you get to climb a medieval tower nearly 1000 years old. There are 500 steps and those with claustrophobia or fear of heights may struggle. The view at the top is worth it though.",
          "The climb is worth it and all ages make it to the top. Beautiful views over Bologna from the top. I was lucky having great weather when I got there as it had clouded over when I started going up",
          "Vibrant area full of Italians being Italian. You gotta love them. History all around. However the towers are surprisingly poorly lit at night.",
          "Tourist attraction to be seen, has interesting history and needs to be seen. Though it simply is 2 towers so it\u2019s not exactly thrilling! But must be seen in Bologna",
          "For only \u20ac5, the tower is definitely worth the price. It's quite the climb, particularly on a hot and muggy day, but the views from the top are worth it. Those with a fear of heights or with vertigo might not like the climb though coming down might actually be worse!",
          "I went to bed more educated... there ae two more leaning towers in Italy. Good to know. Not has impressive has Pisa but worth it",
          "OK, so I suffer from vertigo and this is NOT for the fasint hearted. I got up to the first landing, looked down and wobbled. My wife carried on without me.",
          "Amazing towers! Before visiting you should know that there are time slots for visitors ( every 30 min). It is recommended to buy tickets online or you have to go to the ticket office ( which is 5-8min away form the towers). Entrance ticket 5 Euro . Also I do recommend to make",
          "This is one of the must-see items on the list for Booogna. Interesting, intriguing, and can be accessed from the insight. Ticket sales.",
          "These medieval towers are the landmark of Bologna and cannot be missed. Between the 12th and the 13th century, the number of towers was nearly 180. The richest families used them for defensive purposes. Today, fewer than twenty can still be seen. The Asinelli Tower is the",
          "Even people with vertigo will manage this climb - the climb is broken up by many sections making it easier to climb.",
          "Maybe people do not know that the towers in Bologna (more than 100 in medieval times) were not built for defense but only to show the power of the family. You can today go up the Asinelli tower, a little bit tiring but very rewarding once you admire the panorama from the top!",
          "From the right angle (towards the place where the towers are leaning), if you get at the very bottom of one of the two towers and look upwards, you might get the goosebumps as you could have the impression the tower is collapsing. Well, been there done that. Nice experience",
          "If it is a clear day, the climb will be worth your while. Beautiful panoramic views are to be enjoyed of the entire city. The journey upwards starts in a very tight space for perhaps the first 20 steps. Then the stair case area opens wider. It is quite a climb and you can",
          "We spontaneously bought tickets online 5 minutes before the next tour began. The climb up the 498 steps was much easier than anticipated, but then again we are athletic, not claustrophobic and not afraid of heights. At the top, you have a wonderful view of the city and",
          "This should maybe come with a bit of a health warning! It\u2019s a long way up and a bit of a climb but worth it when you get to the top. The views are great but it\u2019s very crowded so difficult to enjoy properly. Probably best to try and get down before everyone else so that you can",
          "In my half trip find this place while walking around the city. Old towers dont know much history about it.",
          "The two towers are the symbol of Bologna. We did not climb to the top on the 90 degree day we visited.",
          "This was just around the corner from where we stayed. You have to look at the tower from every angle. When we got close to it from one side, you can definitely see them leaning towards each other.",
          "I never get tired of seeing these towers or of climbing to the top to see Bologna in all of its majesty. A trip to Bologna without seeing the towers would be like visiting Tokyo without seeing the Imperial Palace. It is too bad the municipal authorities can't or won't do",
          "Great to see these two towers 5 euros to go up 498 steps and out of breath later the views are wonderful great pictures.The stairs seem steeper on decent noticed pictures on the walls on the way down which i hadnt seen on way up.",
          "Climbing this is not for the faint hearted, anyone with trouble walking or poor physical fitness. It\u2019s an absolute amazing view from the top and good value about \u20ac5 each. However I had to stop every floor and I\u2019m just unfit. Wouldn\u2019t recommend bringing children unless they had",
          "The view from the top is well worth the climb, however I felt that the number of people they allow for each slot was a little too high as it was very crowded at the top.",
          "We where there late. I had no time to go up. Very sad about that. Still great view from outside. Go if you can.",
          "Taking it easy, you can climb the 498 steps to the top of the tower, which overlooks Bologna and provides stunning views of the town and the surrounding countryside. This is one of the must things to do in Bologna.",
          "Nothing to die for, it\u2019s not the best architecture to see here in Italy or in Bologna, but it\u2019s what makes Bologna Bologna, it\u2019s the symbol of this city so it worth a quick look at lest. I did not pay to get on the top, it\u2019s not the kind of thing I do when I travel. Take a",
          "To start off you need to buy the entry tickets from the Bolonga welcome point. Once you arrive you have about 400 steps to climb and it is well worth it as the sights are breathtaking.",
          "It's a long way to the top and depending on your health/physical conditioning you'll be huffing and puffing in no time. The stairs are narrow but there are 4 or 5 landings where you can step out of the line and catch your breath.",
          "Very much as you would expect, great views when you do get to the top, and quite slow progress as your group climbs up and down. You cannot buy tickets at the actual site and must book a time slot on-line ahead of your visit. My group was quite large this meant that with the",
          "Located in the main area of the city the towers dominate the views from many streets. A very good place to walk around. Lots of shopping and of course the towers are themselves very interesting to look at and photograph.",
          "From the very first step I was aware of my physical limitations. This was my Everest and I was determined to conquer it. That spirit lasted for 55 of the 498 steps before I sagged like a deflated balloon on a landing and allowed the remainder of our group to pass. I began to",
          "How do the towers stand up when they are leaning so much? Be early for the queue to assend, lots of steps and takes approx 10 minutes. Great views and you need to be fit.",
          "Must do thing in Bologna. Climb the asinelli tower. Obviously it\u2019s only about the view from the top. My advice buy tickets from the tourist office in Piazza Maggiore and if you\u2019re afraid of heights, have any kind of heart problem or health issue give it a miss. We\u2019re both mid",
          "None of these reviews mention that the climb to the top (and back down again) was actually quite SCARY! But it's not physically too strenuous and the view from the top is worth it.",
          "A stay in Bologna Would not be complete without climbing the 498 steps of Torre degli Asinelli. It\u2019s a tight climb which has quite a few floor stops allowing you to catch your breath. Once at the top you are presented with amazing views. Tickets are bought from the tourist",
          "Once you get to the top of the 498 steps the view is brilliant. There are a number of platforms on the way up where you can move out of other peoples way while you get your breath back. Well worth the very cheap entry price. Tickets from Welcome Bologna office on Piazza",
          "We climbed the tower just before leaving Bologna to take last view. The sightseeing is just brilliant, every pence worth it, would recommend to any of my friends or family.",
          "The Asinelli Tower at 97 meters high is the city\u2019s tallest and well worth ascending the 498 steps for the views at the top. The wooden staircases are steep and narrow, but there are a few rest platforms at stages. Worth \u20ac5 for the experience of looking down on Bologna\u2019s many",
          "I\u2019m not one to venture into a tough workout when on vacation but this one was surely worth it!! I have no words to say but \u2018what a view\u2019!!!!! An absolutely wonderful experience! The view from the top is breathtaking to say the least!",
          "The towers are fascinating, part of historic Bologna. Great photo op from many angles. They are among a multitude of towers in the city.",
          "The views from the tower are incredible. Book your trip just before you go as you need ticket in advance. The stairs are quite steep and ok for anyone if reasonable fitness although they do keep going for a long long way. I think if you have any mobility issues it would be",
          "The two towers are really very high and have a lean. The place nearby is nice. It is very interesting to look at them and take some pictures. I think this place is worth visiting.",
          "Looking at these towers makes one wonder how long they will last. There is some sitting near the towers, where we stopped to have some food - bits of cement were falling on us...how long are they going to last?",
          "Beautiful towers! Cool to see the medieval history of the city right in front of you. Definitely climb the tower if you are able and have the chance! It\u2019s a steep climb but Bologna is the most beautiful from a higher vantage point!",
          "You can do this. Yes, it is about 30 stories you'll be climbing on steep, some times narrow wooden stairs but there are plenty of opportunities to step aside and let others pass. You'll be rewarded with a sense of accomplishment and gorgeous views and the city. On some of the",
          "You book tickets for a time slot. We went early at 9.30 which was an advantage as we didn't meet anyone coming down. Personally I wouldn't be the first in line to go up as you will have a mass of people behind you and have to keep going. We were near the back and often the line",
          "We bought our tickets on the day from the tourist information office in the Piazza Maggiore. Ascents and descents are managed on a timed basis allowing around 30 minutes for each group. The five hundred wooden steps are quite steep, some are worn and others are slippery. Those",
          "You must do this when in Bologna, climb is 500 steps but it is not that hard. You can book tickets online, the website only works with Safari when paying.",
          "This is a long way up in a narrow staircase. I stopped halfway to comfort a woman having a panic attack. I walked down with her. Not sure I missed much!",
          "You should book your tickets online. The tower is excellent. Although there are quite many steps to climb, but it's not a problem for normal person.",
          "I recommend doing the climb early in your visit to get an excellent view of Bologna and the surrounding countryside. It is also interesting to see the construction of the tower. However, this is a pretty serious climb on a narrow staircase. They try to only have people going in",
          "interested and similar to the leaning tower. Good to see and while you are there you can enjoy all the shops and restaurants.",
          "We climbed the 500 odd steps up to the top and we were rewarded with magnificent views over the city out in each direction. Quite hard work on my old knees and with a bit of a chest infection, but worth it.",
          "Book online to avoid disappointment and arrive early - if you\u2019re front of the queue you get to the top before the masses and get great pics.",
          "I had never heard of these towers before.... One of them leans significantly - though depending on the angle from which you look at them, it doesn't always look that way. It is nearly 500 steps up, but once you make it up to the top, the view is incredible. You can easily",
          "Had to book online to climb the tower but was worth the small fee. Cost 3-5 Euros depending on age, student etc. I went up close to sunset and enjoyed the rickety walk to the top. Once at the top, the veiws were fantastic over Bologna and well worth the trek up. Very busy and",
          "Walking upwards the stairs was a true struggle... But the view from the top was magnificent!! The city is red... we loved it! We took a thousand pictures \u2764",
          "We climbed the tower with our 3 and 5 yr old boys, who thought this was great fun. There are platforms you can rest along the way up, and with a large group going in all at once the pace up was pretty leisurely so we made it up no problems. The views at the top are fab. Worth it",
          "Now I have climbed a lot of tall buildings around the world and I have no problems with climbing them or being at a very high height once you reached the top but I can honestly say climbing this tower was one of the worst experience for both myself and my mother and it left us",
          "Amazing views across the city, not to be missed. Of the 200 towers that were built over the city at the end of the 12th century, now there are only about 20. There are 498 steps and although that seems a lot the journey up allows for time to rest at platforms along the way. The",
          "Most impressive... Looking up at these towers and wondering how on earth was it possible to build such edifaces and then... Is it an optical illustration or are they really leaning... True land marks...",
          "Towers built @ 1000 years Ago !!!. One of them is 97 mtrs tall. It is really appreciable piece of architecture.",
          "Early morning or early evening because it gets busy. Make sure you are fit. Fantastic views over the city. Well worth the climb, I lost count of the steps but is was a lot!!!!! Some of the smaller towers are not so busy and worth a try.",
          "These towers really are quite impressive and the smaller is definitely more angled than Pisa...depending on where you stand to view it of course. Nice area with plenty of bars and the student life really gives this area of town a buzz!",
          "Whilst I approached this challenge with a degree of trepidation ! It was for sure worth reaching the top to see the panoramic views from the centre of Bologna ! The climb is steady, with options to stop for a breather at various points as you climb the ~ 500 stairs to the top.",
          "Climb the +400 steps of the biggest tower in the city in a sunny day and you will have a beautiful view of the entire city. Plan your visit in advance because theya are limiting the number of people inside the tower.",
          "The views of the entire city are amazing. It is a great activity to do in Bologna. The cost is very reasonable (only 5 Euros)but you can't book your tix at the tower, you have to do it online or at the ticket centre in the main square. As reviewers have noted, the stairs are",
          "No wonder they built a tower like this to see their approaching enemies. It is an amazing view and worth the slight strain of getting there. If you are scared of heights then my advice is to be get to the front of the queue (by arriving 15 mins early). Then you can slowly and",
          "Arguably, the most iconic tourist site on Bologna, these two towers certainly live up to expectations. The taller one, the Torri di Asinelli was one of the tallest structures in Europe when it was built and remains seriously impressive, not least because of how far it leans out",
          "if you're up for a challenge take the 500 steps to the top - no lift available - stairs are not for the faint hearted - old wooden things. you have to buy ticket on-line or at the tourist office 5 minutes walk away - 5 euro's",
          "The tower is high 97 meters and to go to the rooftop you have to clim 498 steps. I know, it seems a lot, but it is very easy to do and it worth the pain. Very interesting! Recommended to everyone except people who has problems climbing stairs.",
          "2 great buildings gently leaning in the middle of Bologna. Great spectacles to see and part of a wonderful walk",
          "Its a long way up, lots of stairs but levels to catch your breath! Also there is a defibrillator at the top just incase\ud83d\ude02 and a sign part way saying the height of Piza. Cracking view from the top! Well worth it and queues don\u2019t take long.",
          "We didn't wait that long to enter the taller of the two leaning towers of Bologna, so unlike the more famous Pisa, this is readily accessible--at least it was in March. It is taller than Pisa, so you will have to climb, climb, climb to the top, but the view of Bologna is",
          "no better way to get a sense of how people lived in the middle ages than to have a look at these two towers! there were close to 100 of them in the middle ages when wealthy people tried to outrank one another! you'll get a sense of the spiky city (what it once looked like) if",
          "Arrived wanting to visit \u20ac5 tickets but there is a booking system so you can't just turn up. wanted to see the views of Bologna as we had previously done in others towers around Italy",
          "This a fantastic way to see Bologna from above. Also a nice opportunity to immerse into medieval building. Don\u2019t forget to buy tickets online in advance as it\u2019s pretty busy. Top tip: the space on the top is very limited. But don\u2019t hurry to see everything and get into every",
          "This is the second time I've been up the tower, since my last vist they have introduced a timed system and you can't buy tickets at the tower itself. You have to either buy on line or go to the toursit office in the main piazza. The timed session book up really quickly so plan",
          "Strenuous but well worth the view from the top. Need to book tickets in advance from the tourist office. Quite steep steps, so caution needed with young children and anyone with mobility problems.",
          "Beautiful tower, didn't go up as I am claustrophobic and the top gets very narrow, the further you go. However of heights are tour thing I hear the view is spectacular",
          "Amazing vista from the top of the tower, worth the 5 euros to climb the almost 500 steps (some of them very tiny) to the top. You get a total panorama from the very small and crowded platform. Definitely not for the faint-hearted/unfit/unwell or claustrophobic. Your legs will",
          "Book online beforehand or get tickets at the travel info office in the square. Well worth the effort for great views of Bologna. It is strenuous but there are platforms on the way up to rest and some of the steps are narrow. Take your time and then enjoy the fantastic views.",
          "This was one of the most deceiving climbs I\u2019ve ever done. You walk up several flights of stairs and you approach a landing thinking you are almost to the top but then once you get to the landing there are just several more flights and it happens at least 4 times. Still.",
          "We booked tickets online ( they are for a precise time QR code / no printing needed) the entering is only possible during this precise hours as its a oneway route + Number of visitors is limited. Its aprox 500 steps to the top nothing for people who are scared from heights. The",
          "It shows you all of Bologna! Only downside there is not many information about the history of the towers inside or on top. Careful, it\u2019s very crowded when you\u2019re at the top but 30 minutes are enough!",
          "Sub-titled 'the only way is up'; this is a great visit and I echo all the positive reviews. Buy a ticket at the tourist office or pay by iPhone (or some such) at the foot of the tower. Visits are bunched into starting times so you'll need to factor in your time to the other",
          "Really worth the effort - attack of vertigo on the way up - stairs are wooden and a little slippery - but well worth the effort",
          "You need to buy your ticket in advance either online or at the welcome centre in Piazza Maggiore. There are 498 steps up to the viewing platform of the Asinelli tower but it is well worth the effort with stunning views of the city. You are not really aware that it leans by over",
          "This is a wonderful sight, the two towers, one looks as if it is defiying gravity by staying in place, the other dares you to have a go at taking the trek skyward, This I could not do because of age and bad circulation but wishfull thinking. But I did get the lift at the rear of",
          "I went up the tower in November 2018 while visiting Bologna. I bought my ticket online in advance, and would recommend doing that, especially at peak times. I really enjoyed going up this tower, it felt like a real must-do attraction while in Bologna, and the view from the top",
          "Visiting the tallest tower in Bologna shouldn't be missed. For only 5\u20ac and a little bravery, you can bask in a bird's eye view of one of Italy's best cities. The stairway is narrow and steep, but that's part of the wondrous beauty of 13th century engineering.",
          "magnificent buildings, which I photographed from all angles. Garisenda & Asinelli give a special charm to the old town. Built after 1100, they look impeccable today, even after almost a millennium.",
          "It\u2019s an interesting sight with an wonderful history. It was built in 1109-1119. You must climb 498 steps but the view of Bologna is amazing. You must buy tickets on the web before you visit it. It\u2019s 5\u20ac .",
          "Every tourist must visit this place in Bologna. The view from top of the tower was perfect. One strange thing that visitor must buy ticket by internet page or in tourists center what was a little bit difficult to find.",
          "One of towers actually leans considerably. Amazing to see in real life to appreciate the sheer size. You cannot miss it! Just up into the sky!",
          "Climb up the tower. The panoramic view is marvellous. Buy your tickets from in Piazza Maggiore at the tourist point with appointment. 5\u20ac/ticket.",
          "I get on line to climb up the tower. After a couple of minutes and around 4-5 levels of stairs the panoramic view meet my expectations before the climbing. 360view to the ceramic roofs of the houses. The spectacular view from above for Piazza san Maggiore and the lower tower",
          "The towers are very impressive very old and yes they are leaning. But bologna is very dirty full of graffiti and not the arty one. Its important to visit park in the parking lot call Otto agusto it's near by.",
          "Beautiful views of Bologna in the snow. Truly worth the climb. Strangely enough the descent seemed longer than the climb. Excellent.",
          "We originally booked the 12.15 tour up the tower but it was cancelled due to someone collapsing on the stairs and having to call an ambulance and fire engine to get her out. We rebooked on the 5pm tour which was actually better as we got to watch the sunset and it was a bit",
          "A good climb to the top is rewarded with incredible views. We took the creaky wooden stairs to the top in the middle of the day in August during a heatwave. The experience was similar to 15 minutes on the stepper inside a steam room. Incredible views at the top, remember to take",
          "I'm glad I saw the view from the top - but it is a tough climb. I'm in pretty good shape, but these almost 500 steps aren't ordinary steps. They are very old, steep, wooden steps that are narrow in places. While the view will provide some great photos of the entire city, be",
          "It is enjoyable to eat an ice cream at the base of the tower. You can buy gifts for your family from the antique dealer at the bottom of the tower. One of the symbols of Bologna.",
          "Amazing place to see the panorama unless it's fog outside. The structure of the Towers is very well preserved. Tickets available in Piazza Maggiore at the tourist point with appointment. Each tour - 45 minutes. 5\u20ac/ticket",
          "Very old beautiful tower which is loved by everyone! It's nice to go around it as there are lots of people and venues.",
          "This is a must do in Bologna. The ticket was \u20ac6.00 and worth it for the view. Maybe because it was January there were not many people up at the top which made it fantastic for photos",
          "The towers of Bologna are located in the city center. The tickets have to be bought near the Basilica San Petronio, which is just a few minutes away from the towers. After climbing all the stairs up (~100m) you can experience a nice view over Bologna and the surrounding area.",
          "We have climb many monuments in Italy. As we thought we could not climb the leaning tower of Pisa we decided to climb the approx. 495 step to the top. Interesting climb up more fun coming down. The view from the top was worth the effort. If you have climbed the Duma in",
          "The most amazing view of the city, that you will struggle to have! It's a long way to the top, with narrow, very inclined, wooden stairs, so be prepared. The end of your journey up will surely reward you.",
          "We were fortunate to have the tower to ourselves for a few minutes because we got in at the front of the queue. There are 498 steps and it is challenging without a certain degree of fitness. If you enter near the back you could get held up so queue early and speed up those",
          "Getting the chance to climb the oldest medieval tower in the world shouldn't be missed. After the 500 steps hike you get the most impressive view you could have in Bologna. The rooftops of the old buildings make a mosaic that is worth the hike.",
          "I really enjoyed this tower experience :) Tickets are about 4e/person, about 500 stairs to the top of the tower. Amazing views on the city center, piazza di Maggiore and the architecture. Must have in Bologna :D",
          "We been recommend to visit this place and all I can say is, that those 5\u20ac as an entrance fee was worth it. Although nice view can be experienced, be aware that you must walk up tones of stairs and might happen that the terrace will be crowded :-) Small windows and many people",
          "This is a mandatory photo-stop on your Bologna visit. Right in the heart of the city. Yes, they both lean a lot! Take a few photographs from a variety of angles - they look especially good at night.",
          "Frankly there were far too many people allowed in at once, which made the ascent slow, expecially if you are near the back of the long queue. And when you reach the top you struggle to get on the platform as there are people literally blocking the way. Then you have people",
          "No matter how many pictures I had seen, seeing the towers up close was amazing. They are breathtaking.",
          "Good workout for a fabulous view. Book tickets in tourist office in Piazza Maggiore for a specifie time to enter, then queue up at your entry time and climb the tour. Towere staff efficient in getting ticket holders in, given enough time to appreciate the magnificent views",
          "The thought that this tower has survived earthquakes, lightning, wars and who knows what else--for 900 years--makes this a special place to visit. It is definitely worth the 5Euros and 30 minutes of your visit, especially on a sunny day. If you are in good shape, try to get to",
          "Interesting to compare the towers and would have loved to see the view from the top. Slight slope on one.",
          "Great experience climbing appr. 500 stairs up the medieval tower and of course it is an amazing opportunity to get perfect shots of Bologna from above. Definitely worth it!",
          "It was a very interesting place to visit...to go to the top of the tower it was a challenge..many many stairs (wood stairs) kinda cramped place but the view WOW ! seeing the city around it was so incredible... took many pictures from there and to go back down..is very tired",
          "in order to climb the tower stairs you need to purchase a ticket at the travl info office in piazza magiorre opposite the basilica. when you get in line at the tower, it will be you and a number of eager stair climbers. they send groups up the stairs at set intervals. it is a",
          "We walked around Bologna and found this tower. Hidden by the fame of Leaning Tower of Pisa, but this one is also as impressive. Great cafe nearby too.",
          "Pisa is famous for its leaning tower and here we have a couple that I\u2019m informed lean more yet not at all known around the world. A good historical building to cross of the bucket list I guess. I love this kind of stuff but have to admit being slightly underwhelmed by it all.",
          "Well worth visiting and climbing to the top,lots of steps, but the views from the top are worth it,also it\u2019s not expensive",
          "This is a MUST to do in Bologna....its a steep climb but you are rewarded with the most beautiful views of Bologna...one of the best big little cities in Italy. Try and do it early in the morning when it first opens as the stairs are not busy and you get to spend some proper",
          "Well worth making the effort but the stairs are pretty narrow and very steep in places, so be prepared.",
          "Hard to miss these fascinating towers in the heart of town .You are then surrounded by the beating heart of Bologna.",
          "The title says it all. Nearly 500 steps up - 97 metres above the street - well organised groups so no passing on the stairs and 360 degree views from the top. \u20ac5 well spent. And did I mention the tower was built in the 12 century? Jaw dropping!",
          "You must get timed tickets in Piazza Maggiore to climb it. This is the tallest old tower in Italy. I made it up but felt wobbly the whole way, looked at the incredible, misty red-tiled roof views and got back down!",
          "Great way to see all of Bologna at one time!! It's not for the fainthearted, as there are 500 steps to get to the top. It is worth it if you've got the stamina. A panoramic view of the city and the hills beyond. Truly wonderful.",
          "This was the start point of a free walking tour and it was interesting to learn of the history of the towers and the associated stories. This set the theme for the remainder of the tour which was well worth doing.",
          "Climb the tower if you want to have a breathtaking view over the city. Totally worth the walk up and down the steps.",
          "Ambivalently we bought tickets to climb the tower on our arrival to Bologna. There were a lot of people in our time slot and very old stairs that are in parts very narrow and steep. The view from the top was however absolutely worth the effort- stunning! Ps. I recommend",
          "Torre Asinelli is a medieval tower only a few mintues away from Piazza Maggiore. It's Bologna's landmark so it worths climbing the 498 steps to get on the top and amire the breathtaking view of the city. Entrance costs \u20ac5, but you must buy your tickets from Bologna Welcome store",
          "But I know is for safety reasons otherwise 500 tiny stairs to get to a crowded top where you can't really move. No high heels is very hard to go down on those stairs Anycase every high spot is worth it so don't miss it just don't fool yourself you ll get something more than",
          "Wasn't expecting this to be such an arduous climb! I do a lot of sport and I was out of breath at the top. The stairs are very worn and narrow, and coming back down is quite tricky. If you have any mobility issues, I'd give it a miss. Otherwise, we'll worth 5e for the view and",
          "These towers seem to be the iconic landmark of the city. They are very close to the centre and the streets around them are interesting. It is well worth a wander out to see them even if (we didn't) you don't go inside. From something I read, Bologna used to have more than 100",
          "There are two towers near the center of Bologna. It is possible to climb to the top of the tall tower (495 wooden steps). There is nothing inside the tower aside for the stairway. The view from the top is spectacular and provides 360 degree of the city. The interesting thing",
          "They are Towers. They are old. One is taller than the other one. But quite frankly, they're just Towers in the middle of a busy intersection.",
          "My heart was racing as we climbed the steps to the tower but not because there were 498 steps, but because I am scared of heights and was paranoid about the stability of wooden stairs in a near-1000 year old structure. Once you get to the top, you will be rewarded by an amazing",
          "Just recently been to bologna and these towers were on my wish list. We got our tickets from the visitors centre in maggiore square which are 5 euros per person. You get a time slot on your ticket and this is when you have to climb the tower. There are 498 steps to climb and to",
          "Great value for money, my partner was insistent on climbing the tower, I on the other hand wasn\u2019t so keen as I\u2019m not very good with heights and enclosed spaces but my god even I would thoroughly recommend it! The stairs are challenging, but there is a few little landings you can",
          "Amazing, although my 54 yrs old legs felt like jelly for an hour after, there were times when I didn\u2019t think we would make it, but there are levels on the way up you can have a breather. Do it.",
          "These are two of some 20+ towers around the city. You need to buy tickets for the Asinelli Tower at the tourist Information office. This towers is 97m high and the views are well worth the climb",
          "A pity... is not valued as it SHOULD!! With a great illumination at night .... such a great inclination ..... and not protected and well kept as it SHOULD BE ...... with great night lights and indications ...... inmho a must monument to se. A look at the inclination !!!!",
          "`Twin towers next to each other in the city center of Bologna. Both slightly leaning (seems to be a common theme in towers in Italy :)) Very cool. You can go up in the bigger one, which we did not do. Pretty to look at",
          "Very interesting to look at, with a very interesting story behind it. Worth getting a enthusiastic guide that can provide all of the color behind the reason for the towers in Bologna.",
          "This area right here was the loveliest part of town. So much activity, lots of hustle and bustle. 2 amazeball towers to stare at, one completely squeue! Try to go up if you can.",
          "A long climb to the top (500 steps!) but well worth it for the beautiful 360 degree view over bologna",
          "A must visit for any tourist, great historical landmark, and the near 500 steps up to the top will help you burn off your food and wine over indulgence! Best 5euro Ive spent!",
          "See the 2 towers from the bottom and be amazed that one of them is still standing it leans more than the one in Pisa Climb to the top of the Asinelli Tower but pay before you get there! You can book on line or go to the tourist office in Piazza Maggiore Discounts for students",
          "When you want to go on the top of the Asinelli Tower you have almost 500 steps but the view is the best in whole Bologna!",
          "even though I lived most of my life in Italy, and knew about the towers from the history books, I never really had the chance to visit. it only happened now, as a tourist after having been in Australia for 20 years. the towers deserve to be seen, another ageless testimony of the",
          "My partner and I wandered early morning. This place is lovely, great for people watching and photos. Loved Bologna.",
          "These towers started together but only one was finished and in this medieval city it\u2019s height is super impressive. Perfectly straight unlike Pisa and built of stone. But almost as appealing to the eye. Yet another Bologna highlight",
          "The towers definately lean, situated off Piazza Magiorre the two towers are a majestical site. Wandering down the lanes to reach them is a great experience with lots of bars and food shops along the way!",
          "Wonderful way to have fitness during your vacation. Need to buy the tickets before that and they are for predefined hour, but the view is great.",
          "You can see these towers all across Bologna but this one stands next to a smaller leaning one. You have to book online for \u20ac5 adult \u20ac3 concessions. Once you have a time slot you\u2019ll need to queue before ascending the 498 steps up quite narrow and wooden spiral staircases, however",
          "Easy to access . Easy to find and worth finding out what it\u2019s about. For amusement. \u201cThe Two Towers \u201c",
          "Well worth the climb. I don\u2019t usually like heights but this climb is ok as there are very solid wooden steps with rails both sides. I didn\u2019t feel scared at all but be prepared if you don\u2019t like heights it is a tower after all!!! The views were amazing. You can really get a sense",
          "Please please buy your tickets before you get to the tower. There are timed entries. You can book on website or at Piazza Maggiore. So many people just turn up. We managed to press wrong button & had to wait 45mins!",
          "My girlfriend and I visited 2 weeks ago. My purchased our ticket from the tourist office and was able to go up the tower immediately. Once at the top the views are fantastic!",
          "Take time and stroll thru this gorgeous old city and be amazed at the buildings, Bolognas own leaning tower.",
          "Worth the climb for wonderful views. You must buy a ticket online in advance, which is efficient but a slightly frustrating website experience. I have vertigo and felt perfectly ok at the top. The stone staircase seems narrow to start with but widens into wooden sections. I",
          "If you are fit and able then, if you don't climb to the top when in Bologna, you have not seen ALL of the City....you will from the top though. It is a truely magnificent view. Don't worry too much as you start to tire ascending the stairs as I noticed that they have a",
          "The wonder really is that these towers have even survived as both of them are leaning and one has had to be shortened at least once. Imagine, if you can, that there were once 180 of these towers in the city!",
          "Part of the sights to see around the town centre. You can climb up the taller tower but the steps are narrow and it is a steep climb. Better to sit down at one of the nearby cafes and people watch.",
          "The Asinelli tower was something we had to do. It was 498 steps to the top. Views were great and the visitor numbers well managed. No need to rush as you get 45 minutes to climb to the top, look around and the walk down.",
          "If you are okay with stairs and don't mind confined spaces, this is a a must do in Bologna. The views from the top are gorgeous and it's great to see the city laid out in front of you. You MUST reserve a space and buy a ticket in advance. You can buy it over the web, but we",
          "You must reserve online previously, but we did it the same day without problem. To go to the top you must climb around 500 steps, some of them little and slippery. Not reccomended for old people or children. Once we arrived to the top we were completely sweaty... The views are",
          "As others have mentioned you must pre-book your tickets. It's almost 500 steps to the top. Wear good shoes. More interesting the the leaning tower of Pisa.",
          "Make sure you pre book tickets online \u20ac5 each. 498 stairs to the top, highly recommend wearing trainers as the steps aren\u2019t very wide. The climb is not too bad but I wouldn\u2019t recommend for those with and mobility problems.",
          "The views from the top of the tower are really good. To climb to the top of the tower is hard work and the stairs are very steep and windy. If you have a tough time climbing steps, avoid coming here as there is only one way up and one way down. You can't buy tickets at the",
          "Mea Culpa, we didn,t actually dare to take the 496 steps to visit the Asinelli tower. Thought we might have needed rescusitation at the top.",
          "It's great!!! Very high, very beautiful. Be aware: it's impossible to buy the tikets in tower. You should go at first to the touriscenter. If You are not fit, it Will Be very difficult, to climb 498 very tight steps.",
          "A must see in Bologna. Great subject for pictures. The area around it has wonderful shops if you like food.",
          "Book your time slot and experience the beautiful view! I had read that the evening is the prettiest view (for the sun light). Tip: there are a lot of stairs, do not underestimate it! Not for people with fear of heights.",
          "Obviously you can\u2019t miss Bologna\u2019s twin towers, but if you get the opportunity and can handle the many flights of stairs, there are fantastic views to be had from the top, especially over the shorter, more leaning tower. (Which gives a slight feeling of vertigo when viewed from",
          "It is pretty amazing that they still let you go up despite the fact it is leaning already. You cannot go up without a reservation so I suggest booking ahead online. Each session is 45 mins and the last one is 6.30pm.",
          "Despite the fact that you will need to go by stairs a long way, and it is no so easy (old, wood and stear stairs) it worth it! The view of Bologna is beautiful!",
          "Dont be put off by the climb, as once you get to the top, the views of Bolgna are fantastic. The day of our trip was sunny and with the clear sky we could see for miles......",
          "This is a must for any tourist - the climb up the stairs may kill you but it will be worth it for the mind blowing view from the top. Groups go up and down together so there is no horribly scary passing on the stairs and there are refuge areas that you can have a short break",
          "The towers are incredibly high, it's aldo possible to climb up (real challenge). Impressive feature of this city",
          "Being built many years ago and part of the city overall cultural scenery and architecture. Worth seeing",
          "Not too difficult to climb, as we expected worse considering we are fit :P, and the view from up there is awesome...!",
          "Sit at a cafe nearby and be amazed at the leaning tower. Top tip - don't go at a weekend when there are very long queues. We went on a Tuesday and could have gone straight in.",
          "Nice to watch from outside. The tickets can\u2019t be bought at the entrance, one has to buy them at the tourist information wich is ca 400 meters away, so one would need to go back. Disappointed.",
          "If you going to Bologna we must see it. Be ready to 489 steps :) but go up and get a incredible view 360. Do it better in the morning.",
          "Well worth the 498 steps to the top!! The views were beautiful from every angle. It was sometime difficult to snap a picture with so many people, but it is manageable and 45 minutes is plenty of time to get to the top and wait for a good picture. Take in the sights and enjoy",
          "94 metres height is worth it, however not for people afraid of heights, price was 6 p.p. , tickets can be bought on-line",
          "The towers had timed tickets which I was able to buy there and then with my phone. The whole visit took a little over 30 minutes as it\u2019s a long climb. The view is very good though for photographers there is quite a lot of glare and very strong shadows even in the morning.",
          "i do appreciate the awesome view from the top and amazing building that has stand of hundred years already. yet because i am not not impressed by the small-narrow stairs and how cramped the observation area above, i would not mind to miss this attraction. especially if you bring",
          "Not for the unfit or faint hearted - lots and lots of stairs, some steeper than others and not very even. Once at the top, the views over Bologna are amazing so worth the effort. Tickets need to be purchased in advance for timed entry so, I guess, this might mean a wait at",
          "Bologna\u2019s own \u201cleaning\u201d tower is neat to see but as it\u2019s right by a main intersection and lots of wires around, tough to get a good view. Was going to climb the one tower but annoyingly you can only book tkts online, no sales on site and no Wi-fi so out of luck unless your phone",
          "A must when in Bologna, to climb this medieval tower. If you\u2019re not great at climbing stairs be careful as it is quite strenuous. Great views of the city . Buy ticket on line with set times 5 euros. You can stay up top for around 20 minutes before descending .",
          "This is quite a climb. I know, because many years ago, as a teenager, I climbed halfway up the tower and then realized I had to walk back down, so I turned around. The towers mean a lot to me because I had climbed up so many years ago. This time, I just wanted to see them and",
          "Not for the faint hearted 400+ steps and not for those not keen on heights. Take about 0-12 minutes to walk up but great views at the top. A must if you are in Bologna and do not mind the steps of height!",
          "These are one of just a few main attractions in the city so certainly go have a look. We didn't go up inside them because the line was outrageous. I don't feel like we missed out really. They are very cool to see.",
          "I really enjoyed the climb up such old stairways and thought the views were beautiful and totally worth the trip. Also, if you are in halfway decent health, the climb isn\u2019t that difficult. Bought our tickets at the city\u2019s visitor center the day of and climbed with about 30-40",
          "the climb was tough but we enjoyed the challenge, the view from the top was great. we thought we would receive more information on the history of the place however.",
          "Worth the climb, amazing views. Grab your tickets from the main tour office in the main piazza, these will come with a time slot. A great experience!",
          "This is not a climb for the faint hearted, it is steep and there are lots of stairs! Getting a ticket was a little difficult, you had to go to another location to get one. Because it is so narrow and steep only a set amount of people can visit at one time, which means you are",
          "Prior to my visit to Bologna, I was not aware of the existence of these two towers. It was a pleasant surprise to come face to face during my city walkabout. Unfortunately there's no large garden space surrounding these towers unlike the Leaning Tower of Pisa to highlight its",
          "If you go to Bologna, don't loose the opportunity to at least one time visit Asienelli Tower. Prepare your lungs and legs to go up this old tower, but the view at its top worth it.",
          "Well when being in Bologna you must visit the towers. An iconic landscape of this wonderful city that cannot be missed",
          "Very impressive buildings. we didn't take the stairs, but some wonderful shots and photo's in the middle of town.",
          "This tower has 498 steps, straight up, but the view from the top is amazing and if you can master the steps, which are a bit steep and narrow in places, it is worth doing. You have to buy a ticket for a visit time as there is a limit to how many can climb and descend the tower",
          "Brilliant but quite serious going, but I\u2019m 60. A few twenty somethings were struggling but it\u2019s not too bad and you can pause on landings. Trips up go on the hour and you can buy tickets in the tourist office by the cathedral. Or there\u2019s a link from the poster next to Tower to",
          "This is a great workout and offers beautiful views of Bologna. We just purchased our tickets online at the door and used those for entry. It was quite hot the morning we went, early 30s but we were able to climb to the top without stopping to get some unabstructed views of the",
          "There are many towers in Italy that lean and one of these certainly does. You can get to the top but not for the faint hearted.",
          "We managed it on a sweltering 39'C day. Good price, good customer service. The stairs are nicely staggered with platforms, so seems less daunting. The climb down was freaking me out more than the climb up, but my partner advised me to walk down backwards on the narrower steps",
          "Tickets are \u20ac5 each for adults or students can get a ticket for \u20ac3 with a valid student card. Tickets can be purchased from the Bologna Welcome Tourist Office in Piazza Maggiore for a time slot later that day. Make sure you\u2019re at the bottom of the tower early to queue; it gets",
          "\u20ac5 each. Quick to do. Worth it for the view. Fills 30-60 minutes. Get at the front of the queue to get up first as it gets crowded after 10 minutes or so.",
          "Great place to be visited during the day as well as during the night!!! Outstanding architecture and extraordinary atmosphere!!! A must see if visiting Bologna!!! Utterly remarkable!!!",
          "If visiting Bologna a short visit to the Two Towers is a must do!!! It is even more appalling at night time, however superb views during the day as well!!! Sublime architecture and superbly great athmosphere!!! Stunningly beautiful!!!",
          "You can find thous two tall towers in the heart of Bologna. One of them is similar to Pisa tower from the way how it stands, it's really impressive to see such a tall and lean tower. You can climb in one of the left, usually is no long waiting lane and price is reasonable.",
          "We bought tickets at the tourist office for \u20ac5 each, they can also be bought online. Groups climb the tour every 45 minutes as it is too narrow to have people going up and down at the same time. I found the climb terrifying because I\u2019m not great with heights. The views at the",
          "This is not is a major attraction to warrant a reservation. They should accommodate people as they come.",
          "OK, once you make your way all the way up you will be revarded with a breathtaking view of the Bologna. Inside the tower that reaches almost 100 meters, and around 500 wooden steps, not much to see, but Ifelt great respect for those ancient masons and architects who made this",
          "Please buy the tickets oneline or from the tourist info. No proper guidance, only one guy with bad english who tried to explain what to do and when to enter. Almost 500 steps. No elevator",
          "We have bought tickets through internet a few days before (5\u20ac). We was looking forward to beautiful view at all Bologna. But.. when we saw the tower we started to be not very sure to go up. It was surprisingly easy to get around 500 stairs, and that view was really a bit of",
          "Its worth spending the \u20ac5 to climb the stairs to the top of the tower. The views are incredible from up the top.",
          ".. in more sense than one - the taller of the two is strikingly visible from streets around, and I guess you\u2019re obliged to brave the 498 step climb to the top for the panoramic views of the town. You can\u2019t buy tickets at the towers themselves (just at the tourist bureau in",
          "When we arrived in Bologna it was cloudy and raining so i postponed my trip up the tower until the weather improved. You have to buy your tickets from the tourist information point in the main square which is a little distance away and a little inconvenient. Not surprising there",
          "It is a beautiful, historical building. And there are many stores and restaurants nearby selling traditional Italy foods.",
          "A friend and I spent a day on a walking tour of Bologna. Our #1 site to see was the Two Towers of Bologna. We were NOT disappointed. The Two Towers are quite a site and both lean. How many people know there are two leaning towers in Bologna.",
          "498 steps to the top of this medieval beauty and every one was worth it. Wonderful views of a wonderful city.",
          "Even in the rain worth the climb. Get your tickets at main square first. History of the towers is cool too. Read up before you go.",
          "It was a challenge to climb the 498 steps but not that difficult. Arrived above we gave a great panorama of the city but unfortunately the safety features do not allow you to take pictures of the beauty seen from the 98 meters altitude.",
          "These towers are magnificent to look at and even better to head to the top to get the view. While it is a 498 step trek up, and down again, it is well worth it for the scenery that you get to see from 97.5m up in the air.",
          "During walking around the city, 2 towers can be seen from vis Rizzoli. Aproaching there, yes, they are leaning.",
          "In bologna you can find many tower. In 1400\u2019s was a way to show your wealth. It is a nice place to visit.",
          "As you are walking through Bologna, you can\u2019t miss these towers, since they are at or near the center of town. Always crowded with people\u2014 very pleasant to stroll around the entire area",
          "Super view after some efforts.... Very well organized system to visit the tower. Better to buy in the tickets in the tourism office",
          "I don't need to tell you this us tall. Its in fact the highest leaning medival structure in the world. An incredible view of Bolonga not to be missed. Tickets (\u20ac5) are NOT brought near the tower. You need to visit the tourist information centre on the opposite end of Piazza",
          "We Climbed the Tower and we really enjoyed it, we had to purchase tickets from the Bologna Tourist Office before gaining entry, the ticket cost was 5 Euro each which I think is pretty reasonable! You have to book a time slot and go up in groups of maybe 50? We got stuck in",
          "Well worth the 5euro ticket if its hot then go early as the 498 wooden steps to the top are killers!!!. But when you get too the top the views are amazing so glad I did this.",
          "The Towers of Bologna are not as widely known as Leaning Tower of Pisa, but they are also a symbol of the city where they are located. The tallest, Asinelli, is not as inclined as her neighbor, Garisenda, but it is much higher: the height of the Azinelli tower exceeds 97 m. This",
          "Really nice view and not expensive at all! A quick littlw fun thing to add to your day to see a beautiful view.",
          "Ok because it\u2019s only \u20ac5 to climb by the view from the top is just ok. There\u2019s bars over all the windows so it\u2019s a bit limited and the cityscape isn\u2019t overly impressive from above. You can\u2019t walk up independently and instead get sent up in groups so you end up being stuck being",
          "its a rather long climb up to the top. i'm not a young man, but I did get winded on my way up. its worth the view and the bragging rights. took some great photos from the top, as well as from the street level.",
          "These are good to see but if you are not going to climb the hundreds of stairs just take photos. One is fascinatingly tilted/leaning .",
          "So many stairs and not for the faint hearted. It\u2019s a medieval structure so of course there is no lift or modern stairs and it can be a bit of a frightening climb. However the view from the top is unparalleled in the city and definitely worth it.",
          "Bologna is the city with the three (3) \"T's\" - Tortellini; - Towers; - Tities (Sorry no offense intended) Amazing engineering and skill in building this structure so many years ago. A must visit attraction while in Bologna",
          "This is a fun way to spend 30 minuets to an hour. Make sure you have water as it\u2019s a long climb to the top of the tower. It\u2019s a beautiful view once your up there. Would recommend.",
          "The most leaning tower in the world, its definitely worth a visit. You have to clim 498 steps to get to the top, but wow. If in Bologna, don\u2019t miss this viewpoint/attraction.",
          "The two towers, the smaller one leanning rather badly, are tributes to the past. They are striking by their presence but a good guide book will tell many interesting items about them (living quarters, holes to allow boards for entry...). The chruch behing them is worth a short",
          "498 steps sounds daunting but you walk up in a queue, very slowly and everyone huffs and puffs and laughs all the way. Fabulous views at the top make it all worthwhile. Only 5 euro per person. You need to buy tickets online or at the tourist office nearby in Place Nettuno.",
          "498 steps I\u2019m told but well worth the effort. Visits are timed and you buy tickets from the tourist information in the main square close by. The views from the top are amazing.",
          "Not noticeable from the piazza. The lean becomes obvious when viewed above the tower. Gives the piazza a nice old world charm.",
          "I couldn't not go to visit considering I was in Bologna on a business trip. The towers are very beautiful and tell a great historic story",
          "This is a pair of leaning towers just to the East of the main square of Bologna (Piazza Maggiore). One tower is still complete and stands at around 300ft in height, the other is about half as high but leans over at quite a worrying angle. You can book online to get a ticket to",
          "One of Bologna old towers are still available for visitors. Ticket to tower need to buy beforehand from internet and same time have to book time slot for visit. It kind of exhaust to climb about 500 steps but view on top of tower is very nice. Stair are very narrow and partly",
          "This is no easy task climbing the 22 flights of stairs or 498 steps but you can see the whole city from the top so it\u2019s well worth the climb!",
          "It is interesting to find out that many Italian cities have leaning towers \u2013 Pisa is not the only one. Bologna actually has a pair of leaning towers and one is taller than the iconic campanile! These two tall examples standing in the Piazza di Porta Ravegnana are the most",
          "Booked online in advance at a set time as you cannot buy tickets at the tower and had downloaded them to phone. Well worth the climb to the top - amazing views. The number of people who can go up is limited to make sure the top is not overly crowded which it isn\u2019t.",
          "The 900 years old tower had very important military functions (signalling and defence), beside representing with their imposing heights the social prestige of the noble families that owned them. It's a a great experience to climb them and enjoy a very wonderful view of Bologna.",
          "These towers are iconic and thankfully they have not been destroyed by earthquakes with roux enters near Bologna",
          "Apparently in medieval times it was common for families to build towers like this, partly for defence but mostly prestige. Bologna now only has 2 left but nearby San Gimignano has dozens like this.",
          "I was so happy and completely surprised to see the twin towers - that is a really nice monument of majestic Bologna !",
          "Apparently there used to be more towers, used for both defensive and status reasons. The smaller tower was once 70m+ but is now only 48m - and leaning. Much more impressive to see the dozens of such towers at San Gimignano, not too far away.",
          "Given my fear of heights i was delighted to be climbing the inside of the Asinelli tower on a rickety wooden staircase in almost 30 degrees - that said for a 40 something i managed to hoof it up the stairs ahead of the crowd. The views from the top are spectacular (although if",
          "Very impressive, stands out in center of town, nice that it has been left as an attraction for those of us that live in a country that is young.",
          "Beautiful. Good area with lots to see and do, especially busy on weekends when there is a mix of locals and tourists.",
          "Well worth the climb up the 995 steps. The view is incredible!! The climb is not for the faint hearted as it is hot inside, only a small burst of air in a gap every now and again, very steep in parts, and the ancient steps are made for size 3 feet only. The best way to do it is",
          "went there on Friday June 1 in the afternoon not too hot day - good for climbing the 486 steps to the top - safe climb - beautiful 360 view of all of bologna we had 45 minutes to get up and down and take pictures along the way - plenty of time recommended to do when in",
          "We decided to visit early in the day as it was so warm. We bought our tickets from the tourists office at piazza maggiore, you cannot buy tickets at the tower. You can book online. Good plan to visit early as the assent to the top was hard going, 498 steps is claimed and my calf",
          "You now get tickets either online or from Tourist Centre in Piazza Maggiore at Euro5. It is quite a climb when it's hot . Excellent views of the city. They now allow one group in at a time , so there is no longer a meeting of visitors on the stairwell.",
          "We bought a entry ticket at the Information Centre at Piazza Maggiore to climb the 500 steps of this tower. Possibly the highest point in Bologna.",
          "It is a wonderful opportunity to climb this very old tower and see the magnificent views from the top. Pre-booking to climb the tower is essential. The 498 steps are easy to climb so long as you don't mind that the steps don't have backs in them and you don't suffer from",
          "It's just incredible to think that after 900 years not only are these towers are still standing, but the tallest one can withstand thousands of people charging to the top every day! This was probably the highlight of my City visit, so much so that I did it twice - once first",
          "Stairs. A lot of them. And then more. And again. But when you reach the top... amazing, just wow. A visit to the top of the tower is a must do. I recommend climbing the tower first thing you arrive in Bologna to really get a sense of the whole city beneath.",
          "It's certainly proving difficult not overindulge so any exercise is welcome. You can can buy the \u20ac5 ticket online then queue for the nested quarter hourly entry time. It's 500 steps to the top, or thereabouts, so you'll need to be in reasonable shape. You'll be rewarded with",
          "It's good that are still a few examples of these largely pointless buildings. Erected to show off wealth these have been knocked down over the years due rejuvenation or simply how dangerous they are as they begin to lean These are a good example of a good condition tower and",
          "Didnt know about these towers. So much for the leaning Towers of Pizza. These were leaning and shoot right up. Located in the middle of the city. Impressive",
          "Stand at the base of these two towers, the tall one over 90 meters tall, and you will notice with respect' they lean. Not as much as the tower of Pisa, still, very impressive. The athletic tourist may climb the steps inside the tall tower , admire the beautiful panorama of the",
          "Great value at 5 euro. Tickets can be bought online or at Welcome Bologna in the main piazza. Your time will be allocated. The climb is worth it, take it steady and there are places to rest on the way up. Fantastic viewing from all areas of the platform. Be careful on stairs",
          "At 5 euros a ticket this was good value for money. The climb isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds and the 400 steps go pretty quickly. The view from the top is beautiful, very much worth the effort. Not a lot of room to pass in groups going the opposite way so bear this in mind if you want",
          "Very high tower. Buy timed tickets online for 5 euros. Lots of steps. Great view at the top. Must do in Bologna.",
          "For stunning views of Bologna's red rooftops climb the 498 steps of the Asinelli Tower. The panorama over the city is stunning. At the top, expect to jostle for position as tourists take selfies from the limited look out positions. It is Bologna's ultimate selfie spot. Climbing",
          "This is the 97.2m tall tower next to the leaning one and it dominates the skyline of Bologna. We purchased our tickets from the tourist office and queued up at the foot of the tower when it was our allotted time to ascend. There are 498 wooden steps to the top with platforms",
          "havent been in them because i am scared of heights but they are dominating old bologna and look really impressive especially considering their age.",
          "This is the best place to get an aerial view of a spectacular city. It\u2019s 422 steps but the experience from the top is well worth the effort.",
          "The climb up the tower is fairly long, and the stairs are sometimes a bit challenging, but this is not a difficult climb. The view from the top is quite nice, though not spectacular. Wouldn\u2019t call it a must-do, but it is a standard site, and a nice experience.",
          "It is very lively spot almost 24/7 in Bologna, which you simply cannot miss. if it is not raining, just take a gelato sit close to the towers and enjoy the city, it life and view on the towers. we did not go inside the tower but enjoyed it from outside: an outstanding",
          "Once a city of 70 or up to 180 towers, now there are just 5 visible towers remaining. Towers were built by families as a sign of wealth and prosperity. Later they were used for offensive/defensive purposes during conflicts. These two towers are the most significant of the 5",
          "We booked a 10.15 slot on a Sunday and joined the queue and climbed the tower! It's a slog but you get rewarded with great views, the only problem was the overcrowding at the top. It was like a cattle pen and we couldn't move for the sheer problem of people that had been sold",
          "The two towers Torri degli Asinelli e Garisenda are a pair of peculiar buildings when you start to look at them from outside. Then imagine that somewhere between the 12th and the 13th century, the number of towers in the city was possibly up to 180. One hypothesis for the",
          "The short climb is interesting. Too many tourists in each 1/2 hour time slot means the narrow roof area is quite restricted to move around , to take photos. And, frankly , looking down over roofs is uninspiring. Still, it's only a waste of half an hour.",
          "For starters remember Bologna is more about being rather than seeing world famous sights. In other words, the magic of Bologna is finding out of the way small osterias and tratorias rather than visiting monuments, museums or basilicas. Having said this, it is kind of fun to",
          "Well we expected a climb and we've done other towers in Italy so we knew what was coming, however, I think a few others with us didn't know it would be such a push. Great view from the top and took some fab photos but you do feel like this structure is a bit like the tower of",
          "While being on the top of the tower, me and my sister experienced one of the best tower's views ! The price is about 5 euros (not sure if it's not free for university students).",
          "Supposedly the angles are leaning in greater degree than the tower of Pisa, quite dramatic view. We did not try to climb the tower, this one looks tough. Unfortunately these towers are located at a very busy intersection with electrical poles and cables obscuring some of the",
          "If you\u2019re not afraid of heights do this, if you want a great view of the city do this, if you\u2019re scared of enclosed spaces, long staircase climbs and especially heights, don\u2019t do this. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but my partner didn\u2019t, and have up a third of the way up. Should",
          "The climb is pretty rough and I actually got a bit scared, being afraid of heights, because you can see through the stairs as you climb. It\u2019s really narrow, the stairs are wooden and you might feel like you\u2019re gonna fall at times, but it\u2019s worth it once you get up. The view is",
          "There are 500 steps to the top but it was woth the effort since the view on Bologna from above is just amazing. Caution: You have to be fit to master it and I would not recommend taking young children. Very little place on top- it is pretty crowded when the group makes it to the",
          "We walked towards our hotel and passed by this amazing landmark. One torre is the highest tower in town and next is the smaller tower. And of course on the same square is a church. This is a great benchmark to see where we are in town. Also possible to climb the tower for a",
          "I really enjoyed visiting these towers! They are placed really in city centre, they are unique and really antique, and leaning! Wow!",
          "Medieval towers are very remarkable and can be seen throughout the city. The higher is almost 100 meters high. There is an opportunity to climb to its peak.",
          "Took about 15 minutes to climb up. You go up in groups and they estimate it should take 20 minutes to go up, then you get 20 minutes up at the top, before descending. The views of the city are lovely, but I personally did not stay up there for the full 20 minutes as I am not a",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful view of the city but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone with a heart condition. Remembering it a fairly ancient monument set your expectations in terms of amenities at the correct level and it\u2019s really not to be missed !",
          "The view from the top is worth the stair climb. FYI: There are stops along the way and a defibrillator. The steps can get quick narrow and steep in parts. Also make sure you buy your tickets in advance online.",
          "The most prominent landmark in the city and one of the two famous leaning towers. I didn\u2019t actually climb up!",
          "The tower itself is nice but they let too many people at one time so it gets very crowded at the top and it ruines the experience",
          "Well worth the 5 Euros to climb to the top of the tower, the view over the whole of Bologna was wonderful, even though the weather was a bit overcast, no doubt much better on a sunny day. There are areas to stop at to catch your breath if not as fit as you'd like to admit.",
          "It's hard to imagine that the shorter of these two towers (Garisenda) is still standing, given its' incredible lean! The two towers were apparently built in competition between two families to own the highest tower in Bologna, but the shorter of the two had to be abandoned",
          "What a great spot. This area was settled by the Romans & others who came after. The leaning tower plus the other tall one are amazing. You can go up if you want. Lots of shops, cafes & restaurants around here too",
          "Don\u2019t be put off by the amount of steps. There are lots of places to stop and have a little break. Well worth the effort for the great view. \u20ac5 each. Would recommend pre booked, many people didn\u2019t realise this and were turned away as the tickets had sold out.",
          "For the people who enjoy a nice climb of stairs this is the place! It doesn't scare you because the stairwell has a lot of room , once up top it offers you the perfect view of the city , you can't buy tickets from the tower you have to go to Piazza Magiore .",
          "We didn't even know you could do this but saw the signs, went to the web site and booked a time. Well organised; people go up in relatively small numbers to avoid congestion on the steps, of which there are a lot, hundreds I imagine. So if you've got dodgy knees or are very",
          "We couldn't wait the line to climb up those nearly 500 stairs. I am sure the view would be fantastic. Not for the light hearted. Only for fit people.",
          "You should do this. We booked a reservation at the Bologna Welcome center in Piazza Maggiore where we also bought the bologna welcome card. We bought the card at 10:50 and got a reservation on the 11:00 climb on a Thursday in the middle of April. The climb itself is pretty",
          "The two most famous of the centuries old towers in Bologna, even if you don't ascend the Asinelli (498 steps...) take a moment to stand underneath and gaze upwards. Yes, they are leaning, but safe... The only downside is the amount of traffic going past, plus the overhead power",
          "The nearly 500 steps to the top of the Asineli tower, crafted from wood, recently restored but already shoeing signs of wear, make this a challenging activity, you need to be reasonably fit. Once at the top the views are, predictably, amazing. Go for it, they have a",
          "I really wanted to climb the tower so that I could get take some fantastic aerial view photos of the city. Sadly, I only managed approximately 200 of the 500 steps before claustrophobia set in and I had to go back down. The climb is well organised and you have to descend before",
          "Great viewfrom the top and the steos were good. Well organised time slots so that there is plently of time to get to the top and enjoy the views before descending.",
          "It was possible to make reservesion online and we could choose the hour for climbing. Nice view from the roof!",
          "Well worth climbing the 498 steps to the top. 360 decrees views over the stunning old town of Bologna. Buy your tickets from tourist information in the town and reserve a time slot. Get 45 minutes in total, which is plenty of time. This is a must for those able to do the climb.",
          "It really was a fantastic view up there. I have given it 5 stars because the Tower itself is great but getting tickets was a bit of a nightmare. They cannot be bought by the tower. There was an option to buy online from a QR code but it didn't work. We had to schlep back to the",
          "An interesting starting point for your walking tour of Bologna but not that exciting unless you want to climb to the top. Get tickets first at the tourist office. Good gelateria nearby for when you descend....",
          "You need to book online or get tickets from tourist information place. You can\u2019t just turn up and pay. You get a timed ticket. There\u2019s nearly 500 steps to climb. There\u2019s a few places you can stop on the way up, especially if you are holding people behind you up!! Nice views of",
          "These two towers are rightly an emblem for the city. The tallest in 97m high, and still stands nearly straight. This one can be climbed, giving great views of the city from the open top. I would highly recommend it, especially on a clear and sunny day. Once there were 139 of",
          "A day to remember, it is an emblematic place in Bologna therefore you should go there if in Bologna even for a day.",
          "We arrived at the iconic landmark symbols of the City. The towers of Torri degli Asinelli and Garisenda. The Asinelli tower stands at 97.2m and has inclination of 2.2m apparently more than the Pisa tower. To access the Asinelli tower you must first buy tickets at the tourist",
          "Climbing the Tower was exhilarating, over 500 steps. You have to buy tickets in advance as a group climbs up together at a specified time. The steps aren't made for people to be climbing both directions at the same time. The climb is well worth the stunning view at the top,",
          "One of the major sights in Bologna. Make sure you try to get in for a nicer, higher view of the Old Center. I sat at the base of the smaller tower, and just be fascinated with how these towers don't really fall down!",
          "Signed up for an 11:45 entrance. They allowed far too many visitors in. The climb up was slow due to the numbers heading up the stairs. At the top was crowded and little consideration by most for sharing the limited viewing portals. Great view though.",
          "We counted almost 500 steps, many parts are quite steep so it\u2019s not recommendable for people who are afraid of heights or have walking problems. The view is however stunning.",
          "500 steps, nice view. Mind this is the proper (vertical) tower, not its leaned sister that is 10 meter away from it.",
          "The towers themselves are not that spectacular but the environment around them is fantastic, a couple of smaller squares and lots of cafes around. Lovely place to sit and watch Bologna",
          "You have to buy the tickets in advance, from tourist information on Piazza Maggiore or online, and you can choose a time. It's in 45-minute slots to get up, look around and get down, which is perfectly manageable. Not for the very claustrophobic or people with vertigo but it",
          "Bologna is great to visit early spring. The city is great at the end of the day. Typical towers will guide you through city centre.",
          "Sadly it was raining for the 45 mins we were climbing up and spent at the top, but that didn't detract too much from how worthwhile the climb is. You have to pre-book. Tickets can be purchased from information office at piazza Maggiore. Best bought with Bologna card which throws",
          "I was so excited to see the famous twin leaning towers of Bologna. My entire life I had only heard of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. So when I heard there were Leaning Towers in Bologna I made them the first things I had to see and was not disappointed. It is located in the city",
          "You have to reserve your ticket for a specific time (they have 45 minute timeslots) either at the tourist office in Piazza Maggiore or online (which didn't work for me. Some of the steps are rather narrow and steep, but all in all it feels very safe. The view of the city from",
          "It\u2019s a must do when in bologna. The views are stunning and it took me 9 min to climb 489 stairs (because some people walk slower and it\u2019s almost impossible to overtake in the narrow staircase) Only thing that could be better is the procedure of buying the ticket. You need to",
          "The Asinelli tower has looked over Bologna for centuries and is well worth the effort of climbing. The trip has to be pre booked, either at the tower or as we did, online a few days before, 6 Euros well spent. The climb is relentless over steps that appear as old as the tower,",

          "500 stairs to go to the top. Worth to see the view on top and the stairs are not so bad. Need to book the entrance if you want to climb. The place with the two towers (one falling) is very nice as well, worth to see.",

        "wiki": "The Fountain of Neptune (Italian: Fontana di Nettuno) is a monumental civic fountain located in the eponymous square, Piazza del Nettuno, next to Piazza Maggiore, in Bologna, Italy The fountain is a model example of Mannerist taste of the Italian courtly elite in the mid-sixteenth century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the fountain was commissioned by the Cardinal Legate Charles Borromeo, to symbolize the fortunate recent election of Borromeo's uncle as Pope Pius IV. To clear space for the fountain, an entire edifice had to be demolished.\nThe design and assembly of the fountain was completed by the Palermitan architect Tommaso Laureti in 1563. The fountain was completed in 1565. The over-life-size bronze figure of the god Neptune was completed and fixed in place around 1567. The statue was an early design by Giambologna, who had submitted a model for the Fountain of Neptune in Florence, but had lost the commission to Baccio Bandinelli.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNeptune Fountain has its base on three steps, on which it is situated a tank made of the local boulder and covered by marble of Verona. In the centre of the tank, there is a base where there are four Nereids who holding their breasts, from which jets of water emerge. The base is decorated with pontifical emblems, ornaments that - connected to four cherubs - hold dolphins (which are allegorical representation of major rivers from the then-known corners of the world: the Ganges, the Nile, the Amazon River, and the Danube. In the centre of this base raises the majestic figure of the Neptune sculpted by Giambologna's; the statue is a typical expressions of the manneristic theatricality.\nThe Neptune stretches his left hand in a lordly gesture, appearing to be aiming to placate the waves; this posture is interpreted as symbolic exaltation of the  new power of the Pope Pius IV: just as Neptune was the master of the seas, the Pope was the master of Bologna and of the world.\n\n\n== Inscriptions ==\nOn the four sides of the marble tank there are four inscriptions in Latin provide the background to the fountain's construction:\n\nFori Ornamento (to decorate the square);\nAere Publico (built thanks to public money);\nPopuli Commodo (built for the people);\nMDLXIIII (built in 1564; the date is wrong though, since the fountain was officially finished in 1566).The four main sources of political power for Bologna then are also inscribed on the base: \n\nPius IIII Pont. Max (Pope Pius IV)\nPetrus Donatus Caesius Gubernator;\nCarolus Borromaeus Cardinalis; (Cardinal Carlo Borromeo)\nS.P.Q.B. (Senatus Populusque Bonononiensis) (Senate of Bologna)\n\n\n== Symbolism ==\nThe trident of the Neptune's statue inspired and it was used by Maserati brothers as emblem for their first car, the Maserati Tipo 26. The logo was realized in 1920 by one of the brothers, Mario Maserati, at the suggestion of a family friend, Marquis Diego de Sterlich. This is still today the logo of the Maserati car company The fountain and its sculpture are one of the most iconic symbols of the city and references to them can be found in many symbols, commercials and logos. This includes the historical students' fraternity (Goliardia) \"Excelsa Neptuni Balla\", on whose emblem figure two tridents.\n\n\n== Copies ==\nSeveral copies of the fountain exist around the world, such as in Laeken (a suburb of Brussels) commissioned by king Leopold II; in  Palos Verdes Estates in California; and in Batumi in Georgia. A copy of the statue of Neptune can be found at the entrance of the Yamato Museum in Hiroshima, Japan, while a cast - made in 1907 - is kept in the Bologna's Archeological Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFountain of Neptune, Florence\nNeptune\nMythology\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It is definitely worth a visit. It is really nice fountain. My little boy was amazed with it, as he is a big fun of Roman and Greek mythology and it was a big adventure to see all the perfect statues and fountains.",
          "This famous statue and fountain has recently undergone a thorough restoration and is no longer swathed in scaffolding. The trident being held is reputed to be the inspiration behind the logo for Maserati cars. Ultimately though, it's just a statue in the corner of a square. If",
          "I have seen a few similar fountains in different European cities. This one looks really nice. It is not huge, its attractiveness doesn't lie in its size. What is pretty about it, is the precision of its details as well as the quality of materials used to erect it.",

          "The last time we were in Bologna (April 2017) that beautiful fountain was in scaffolding and under refurbishment. So, there wasn't much to see but we have seen it during previous visits to the city and really liked the statues composition. It's adjacent to Piazza Maggiore and",

          "Piazza Maggiore has one artistic decoration, a fountain, dedicated to the God of water. A huge bronze figure stands on the top of the interesting composition with symbolic figures of women with big breast on each side of the pedestal. Sculptures and composition are a masterpiece",
          "Next to the main square you can not miss this lovely statue. Built in the 16th century by Flemish sculptor Giambologna, it is a symbol of the power of the Pope.",
          "Splendid what more can I say.There is so much to see in this lovely city.Wear some comfy shoes/boots as there is a lot of walking involved.",

          "Not much to see, the fountain is under construction. You onlu see the statue surrounded retauration materials.",
          "We took the 30 minute train ride from Florence to Bologna. On arrival, it's a 15/20 minute walk to Piazza del Nettan which is the main square but there were plenty of cabs available outside the station. If you can, I suggest the walk. On leaving the station, go straight across",
          "Although the fountain is interesting, I would not rate it highly. The square is beautiful, but as of now the fountain is shrouded and under repair. Check before you undertake a visit with high hopes.",
          "Sure it would have been just stunning had we been able to see it. These things do happen as nothing lasts for ever.",
          "At the moment the fountain of Nettuno is covered with scaffolding for restoration. Would have loved to see it but everyone need some pampering once in a while. :)",
          "Although it is covered and under restoration this fountain is beautiful and still worth going to see. We had a one hour informative tour which took us inside the scaffolding where they have stairs winding up the fountain so you can see pretty much view each part of it. It was",
          "I was disappointed that I could not observe the fountain but weather is hard on these pieces of art and I am glad that restoration is happening.",
          "The bad news is that this statue is closed\u2014the good news is that it is being fully restored with a working fountain. Currently all you can do is sneak a peek under the scaffolding and read about its restoration on the banners surrounding it.",
          "The fountain is under repair at present so cannot be seen. Plenty to see in the vicinity though - Piazza Maggiore etc.",
          "Unfortunately the fountain is undergoing restoration and access is extremely limited to guided tours at certain times. Did not see due to protective barrier around fountain.",
          "This fountain is being refurbished so currently this is a tarpaulin covered eyesore. In Rome the restoration if the Trinita dei Monti above the Spanish Steps resulted in a very imaginative canvas on the tarpaulin- not so here sadly. Having seen how imagination can be",
          "What more do you expect? But for being a fountain it's beautiful! Well, not while under construction, but I saw it a few years back not under construction and it was lovely.",
          "Currently being restored, and unavailable to view; being situated in the squares in front of S.Patronio it would be silly[ and hard] to ignore. It is the work of Giambologna.",
          "The statue is under a large cover since it is being restored. You can for a price walk through and see the fountain. We saw it a few years ago when in Bologna and it was very cool and worthwhile, Chose not to pay to see it this time. Lots of bars, restaurants and so on near",
          "Saw it 1992, but will have to come back when the restoration is complete. All you can see is Neptune,s head!",
          "It is wrapped in plastic for renovation. It looks like it will take a while before it reopens for public viewing.",
          "To bad that it is still not finished, and that I couldn't see it only from the pictures. It is one of the main attractions of bologna and from what I read it has been under construction for a long time already",
          "We visited this as part of the tourist office three day card. It was well worth it. The guide was excellent, clever, witty, learned and fun. It was wonderful to see the restorers at work and to hear about the challenges they face as well as seeing them work from close quarters.",
          "We really enjoyed our tour of the renovations (11am daily at the time we visited - tickets from the tourist office). It was fascinating to hear the history of the gigantic statue and future plans for it and also to watch the people delicately working on the restorations.",
          "The statue is being renovated. Took a free tour of the site with Bologna Welcome as part of the Bologna card package. Tour was too lengthy because of the need to translate information in Italian and English. Not so interesting.",
          "This beautiful fountain was build in mid XVI century. The gigantic bronze Neptune is surrounded by four sirens. Simply beautiful.",
          "The statue is still being renovated and won't be finished until the end of the year. You can take a tour around the statue at 6pm most days which you can book and pay for in the Tourist Office. You can walk up to the top of the scaffolding and get a closer view of the statue",
          "Saw it before the renovation. Nice XVIth century fountain in the Piazza del Nettuno. Typical Italian-style, of course, it has its place in the center of the city.",
          "The fountain makes an impression. Right next to it is a water hole in which we can fill empty bottles. And by the heat of the holidays this is a very useful point. Unfortunately since last year it is under renovation, so I am waiting impatiently for renewed views :)",
          "Can not be see for the moment. It's closed for renovation. That's a pity-it's not possible to see it.",
          "Unfortunately Neptune's fountain was under polythene due to it being refurbished while we were there. The Piazza however is still worth a visit due to the surrounding buildings, restaurants, cafes and wine bars. Great place for people watching.",
          "Great place to spend some time, particularly on hot summer days. We happened to be there at the time of a wedding. Great pictures! This is really one of the most pittoresque places in this area. The streets around it are just as lovely, with their medieval arches and many, many",
          "The fountain is being restored and is totally sealed off during work. Only text detailing the work is visible at this time. Use the time to visit the other great sites nearby.",
          "This time nothing of seeing this fountain. They are working on it. Sorry that we couldn't see it. Last time in Rome also couldn't see a Fountain Di Trevi and the church on Spanish steps. My kids was really unhappy",
          "One of the most iconic attractions in town, Completely shrouded behind scaffolding indefinitely, but for. \u20ac 5, you can climb inside and peek at Neptune's face up close.",
          "The fountain is presently being refurbished, so it's hidden from public view. Not sure when the fountain will be visible again.",
          "The fountain is currently closed for renovation but a guided tour up the scaffolding is included within the Bologna Welcome Card that can be purchased at the tourist office. Our guide was very knowledgeable not just about the fountain but the town too. It was good to see",
          "Walking in the town is nice to see the Nettuno's fountain, it was Sunday night and the traffic was cut and we can watch the lights of the fountain so well.",
          "presently all covered up for repairs but i have been there in 2013 june very nice place and you hae the statue of masserati a must vist i will recommend",
          "The fountain Looks beautiful but we can't see it as it is under repairs. Guess we'll have to come back!",
          "All covered up under repair so can't see anything . Area around it was dirty and uncempt , didn't stay in this area",
          "Not much to see as scaffolding surrounds the statue. Plenty of other sites and things to do in the immediate area.",
          "We could not visit because the fountain is closed for repairs. After all, Neptune is due for major make up and re-adjustment after standing in the elements for centuries in the same position. I guess they are sharpening his trident.",
          "Went to see this and was unable to as it is currently being refurbished and is covered in scaffolding and screens. Check that it has reopened to avoid dusappointment",
          "Such a shame but we will return to see it. Scaffolding means you cannot see this. Not sure when it reopens but check if you intend to visit.",
          "Hopefully by the time you read this review it will have been restored and no longer covered up. Turn around and look at the faces of the resistance fighters on the memorial behind you instead.",
          "This is one of the most known monument in Bologna but unfortunattely under the renovation, so it cannot be seen. We were a little bit dissapointed but what can you do if it needs the renovation.",
          "The Fontana is the iconic symbol of Bologna and is undergoing complete overhaul at the moment so it is covered in scaffold etc. But you can be given a tour around so get very close and see the detail much better than from the ground . As a bonus our guide gave a history of the",
          "Unfortunately under renovation at present. I had a peep through the protective fence and clearly this is magnificently grand fountain. Looks like it is about to be made great again!",
          "Nothing to see as yet apart from plastic sheeting covering the statue. Shame but still there is an awful lot to see and do in the close vicinity.",
          "If you came to Bologna expressly to see this statue, you're going to be disappointed as it is completely covered up. But it is located in the attractive piazza maggiore so you're going to see it \"inSitu\" anyway. From pictures, it looks impressive.",
          "Restoration work was going on. We had a guided tour of the statue. The guide was informative and interested in sharing extra information also.",
          "I love this part of Bologna... I think this piazza is lovely and place you can visit this city in the spring time.. a lot of places to eat at.. plus, a great place for shopping..\ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42",
          "If this is a must do in Bologna be aware that it is undergoing renovation work at the moment. You can get tickets for a inside tour to view the work being done. Ch ck with the information office in the piazza maggiore.",
          "We booked the tour to see the fountain under scaffold through the Tourist Information Office around the corner. The only slot available in our weekend was for 7.00pm. The guides conducting the tour arrived promptly asked everyone where they were from then proceeded to conduct",
          "The Fontana is a wonder to see when it is lit up at night. We have seen it often, but on this stay in Bologna we discovered that it was being worked on and thus surrounded by scaffolding and weather proof \"wrap\". But, you can see the work inside the \"wrap\" if you fill out a",
          "Normally it is a place not to miss in Bologna. Currently, the Fontana del Nettuno is under construction and everything is hidden behind a solid coverage.",
          "We visited Bologna in September 2016 and were very disappointed that the fountain was completely covered up and undergoing renovations. It seems that as of March 2017 (6 months later), renovation is still ongoing...",
          "At the moment, the highlight of the Piazza is behind netting whilst it undergoes repair and refurbishment. Should be complete by the summer. We found out that you can see the statue at close quarters if you book a tour at the Tourist Information office. Tickets are \u20ac10 each,",
          "Statue is currently under cover of scaffold and sheeting during works - March 2017 Access to the square is still open just don't expect to see the statue, not sure when its due to be finished",
          "Unfortunately the fountain is restored at the moment. Therefore it is completely covered and can not be visited.",
          "This is one of my favorite sites in Bologna. Right now it's covered for restoration and I look forward to seeing it look all new in the future.",
          "You can see the original statue in the city museum but the fountain itself is boarded up at the moment (Feb 2017).",
          "Situated in piaaza maggoire, this is of course an interesting landmark in the city of Bologna :) It is there right in front of the Bologna Library :)",
          "I saw the statue first some 20 years ago and remember the beauty and strength. Now it is invisible: it's being restored under a gigantic tent. Check out status of restoration before you make the trip.",
          "The fountain was under construction when visited it.But it is a part of Bologna and can not be missed!",
          "The Fontana was on our top 5 things to do list but unfortunately it was closed and covered for restoration and whilst such works have to be done; meaning a few will miss out, it left the square soleless.",
          "I tried to see the statue in January 2017 and it was closed for refurbishment. It its totally surrounded by boards so there is no chance to see it. I of course understand that it is required to preserve the statue, but please don't go to Bologna expecting to see it any time",
          "Ok, it was closed. Will be for several months if not years. That means you cannot view the fountain in action as of January 2017. The good news is you can still visit the renovation site by buying a guided tour tickets from the Bologna tourist office just a stone throw. 5",
          "Couldn't see much since it's being restored. Still nearby places are stunning and so are the buildings.",
          "Though I think it a little overrated, it is still a very nice monument, surrounded by many historic sites and buildings, well worth visiting!",
          "This is currently being cleaned restored so is completely surrounded by scaffolding. However was still well worth doing the guided tour of the statue which can be booked at the tourist office next door, because the guide was able to give a lot of interesting history about the",
          "This is under renovation, but that was hard to figure out while searching. I did find out you can book ticket to see the workers doing the renovation at the tourist booth, but that was up to Dec 2016. We didn't do it, so missed it. Just wanted to let everyone know it is",
          "The fountain is still covered in scafolding and banners, but supposedly you can arrange for tours during certian hours.",
          "The fountain of Neptune, my favorite Roman god is easily found in between the main Piazza Maggiore and Piazza del Nettuno. It wasn't running while we were there but still beautiful. Great area to walk during your evening walk.",
          "Unfortunately, right now the fountain is under restoration, being closed in a temporary building and surrounded by scaffolding.",
          "you could not see this fountain because it was enclosed and being refurbished. If you wanted to go inside to look at it you had to pay a fee to get inside the construction area",
          "Can you really miss this fountain? Probably not. It's a nice landmark in the city surrounded by beautiful old buildings.",
          "Top tip currently (as of November 2016) the fountain is being restored.....so you can only see what it looks like online or via the boarding around it! Wrong!!!! All you have to do is go to the Tourist Information Office located in the Piazza Maggiore, opposite the Basilica.",
          "This is currently under restoration and is covered up. They offer guided tours but from what we saw from the outside it's worth visiting when open again",
          "I were there in sptember and the whole statue was wrapped in with metal, wood and fabric. I was really disapointed.",
          "As per August 2016 the fountain in under restauration and cannot be seen. It is covered in Scafolds. We tried to peek but not much can be seen.",
          "Omg so disappointed when I went to see this must see attraction in bologna. Walked quite a ways to discover that the fountain was completely encased in scaffolding and walked off as well, boooo",
          "Unfortunately at the moment the fountain is being restored so the access to it is very limited. Hopefully will be re opened soon.",
          "The mighty man and his retinue are currently in a gigantic cage during restoration. It looks like he and they will be incarcerated for some time to come. Not so much as the base is available for viewing; the box/cage makes an unsightly blight on the Maggiore as did the booths",
          "I am not an artist or art critic.....I just love looking at artwork. I love stopping and looking at the sculpture. A great place to hang out and have a gelato.",
          "The fountain is undergoing major refurbishment and you are unable to view it, which is a shame as this is one of the landmarks we were looking forward to seeing",
          "We didn't get to see as it was being restored... It is great like they take care of their national monuments, but it's sad that I was here at that exact time. Anyway... the low score is because of that.",
          "This is in the main square so easy to find. It was partly in scaffolding when we visited but yiu could see enough to see it is impressive.",
          "The fountain is shut for restoration but you can get up lose on a guided visit inside the tent. Great guide and wonderful views.",
          "The one disappointment in Bologna was that Neptune was under wraps and only available with a guide and by prior appointment",
          "Not filled with tourists, Bologna is a lively college town. Young people walk the streets, laughing and talking.",
          "My husband and I recently visited Bologna, Italy. The statue of Neptune is at the center of the city and an important sculpture to see. Unfortunately, it is being restored and was not visible under all the coverings. You will have to wait for them to finish.",
          "Unfortunately monument is being restored so not available to view for another several months. A pity for us to miss out.",
          "This was on my list of items to visit and photograph but currently is completely closed off for reconstruction and draped with canvas. The date for re-opening is not clearly stated",
          "We wanted to see but totally covered and being worked on. It is shrouded in huge white tents and i am sure will be terrific but not for a while.",
          "Walked around for 20 minutes with google maps on my phone and couldn't find the statue ... Finally realised I walked past it a dozen times but it was rapped in plastic for restauration...what a fool I am....",
          "At time of writing (Sept 2016) this is coverered in the ubiquitous scaffolding that is the scourge of every tourists photo opportunity. Not sure when restoration will be finished but certainly don't go out of your way to see this right now!",
          "Currently being restored,and covered with scaffolding. Could not believe that they want you to pay \u20ac3 to see it by climbing up scaffolding. Felt insulted!",
          "Closed off with scaffolding and wooden fencing so you can't see it. But there's Basilica di San Petronio ( the big church ) and other museums nearby so don't fret.",
          "Sept 2016 it's entirely covered for repairs or something. Not sure how long this will last. Last time there it was functioning and fantastic!",
          "Everyone has told us that Neptune is at the centre of this beautiful city and how brilliant the statue is and when we headed towards him he is being restored and cleaned so we were unfortunate but I would still give this 4 stars as just know that if the scaffolding and covering",
          "This, one of the amazing sights of Bologna is undergoing a massive restoration, It has suffered deterioration of both stone and metal and apparently the waterworks side has never really worked properly. The lighting is also being fully updated so come back next year and see this",
          "This is under restoration but it is possible to visit for a guided tour but you must book at tourist office as places are very limited and tour only at 10am.Though we would have liked to see the fountain in entirety the tour guide explained everything about it and you could get",
          "Well not true since the mermaids spout water from well you know while the massive physique of Neptune leaves little to be seen!!! The town fathers meant it that way-- oh the jealousy!!! Anyway you can't miss these bronze beauties when touring the Piazza Maggiore and the basilica",
          "This fountain is located in one of the main squares so you'll probably pass it anyway. It's nice, and has an interesting array of water nozzles, but lacks the majesty of say, the one in Florence.",
          "You cannot see the statute as it is surrounded by scaffolding. Perhaps we will be able to visit Bologna again and see it then.",
          "I was looking forward to sharing with my son Fortana del Nettuno. Unfortunately he is covered in scaffolding obviously getting renovated. Hopefully he will reappear resplendent soon.",
          "As title says, statue is being renovated. So i found a picture online, looks impressive. I always have this.. Sigh .....",
          "The statue is under restoration and our hostess at the B&B didn't know when it would be open again. See my review of the PIazza Maggiore for more.",
          "Must be beautiful but is invisible by maintenance works. The fountain is completely enclosed by a large tent with scaffoldings.",
          "What a disappointment for me to rush to Piazza Maggiore to view the Fountain of Neptune---one of the most important pieces of 16th-century public sculpture in Italy. When I was there in June, it was completely covered up for restoration. I couldn't even properly peek through for",
          "It was covered, I suppose for maintance. It was pity I couldn't see it. In some others monuments usually the cover has at least a picture of it. This time nothing.",
          "In the heart of Bologna where you can find the Roman architecture. Weekend you can find lots of activities going over there. I think is better to view this fountain with a guide. The hidden messages in the gestures and the history behind the sculpture need explaining for us to",
          "If you are planning on seeing Fontana del Nettuno keep in mind that it is closed for restoration and with limited viewings only at 10:00am Monday through Friday, there is a sign that says it will be under restoration until December 2016 so you will not get to see it in all of",
          "very disappointed not to see the statue. There was no explanation as to how long the restoration, or how long it would be hidden from view. Just managed to see a small model of it in the town hall.",
          "I was last in Bologna 20 years ago and failed to see Neptune then as he was being \"restored\". Just my luck to miss him once more and for the same reason. Taking months to do - may be done by Christmas.",
          "Unfortunately for us - and fortunately for future visitors - the statue was under wrap due to repairs /restoration. Otherwise the site is easily reached. Near the Basilica of Saint Petronio on the Piazza Maggiore.",
          "The entire fountain is cordoned off for renovation but this place is beautiful at night. You might be disappointed if you're visiting Bologna in the next few months to see this fountain.",
          "It was in scaffolding for renovation. When I've seen it, it was wonderful located in a lively piazza.",
          "Completely covered in scaffolding and sheeting and likely to be for some time as this is a major restoration",
          "It is located on Piazza maggiore and it should be part of your oerall walk around the city center, to see the architecture of the buildings, the shops, the people. Nothing spectacular, just the interesting statues.",
          "The Fontana was all enclosed and not available for anyone to see it. Disappointing. Since it's close to the Piazza Maggiore you can visit this area and do a lot of shopping and stop to people watch or eat. The Basilica di Santo Stefano is there as well and is worth visiting.",
          "They were working on this massive fountain when we were in Bologna. It seemed a goal for those working that no one be able to see any part of this monument. It is blocked off very well, so don't waste your time. However, Piazza Maggiore and San Petronio are close and awesome.",
          "Disappointed to find that it was shrouded in scaffolding and concealed behind protective covering, obviously being restored or cleaned!.",
          "I wouldn't have reviewed but when we arrived it was covered in drab scaffolding and tarpaulin. They could of put printed tarpaulin showing what was inside and what they were doing. Instead it just let the area down.",
          "Central point of Bologna. Lots of good restaurants and shops in walking distance. Interesting ancient buildings surrounding.",
          "We recently stayed in Bologna and view of this lovely attraction is currently hampered by the metal scaffolding surrounding the statue which is being restored. I believe it will be completed by the end of the summer. Maybe we'll get to see it on a future visit.",
          "Very disappointed, as completely obscured by scaffolding and you really struggled to see anything of the fountain",
          "As other contributors have mentioned, this statue is currently hidden behind rather a lot of scaffolding. I wasn't aware of the restoration work that was taking place prior to my visit, so a bit of a shame. No doubt there will be a grand unveiling ceremony, but I can't imagine",
          "The statue is surrounding by scaffolding at the moment for cleaning and restoration, and will remain in this state until the end of the year. so it is impossible to give a review. However what I could see, looked pretty special.",
          "Great to see normally, but currently enclosed in scaffolding as it is under renovation...who knows how long it will be? (rhetorical question)...",
          "Repair working will be going on throughout the summer and this unable you to see the statue, poor timing !",
          "Don't go make a special trip looking for it at present as it's covered by scaffolding and sheets while restoration is being carried out.",
          "We enjoyed the very compact centre of Bologna and used this impressive statue as an aid to navigating the small streets around it. It is very easy to explore the historic district as the attractions are close together and the centre of Bologna is mercifully flat after the steep",
          "It's always a delight to see the Fountain of Neptune in Piazza del Nettuno, which was built in 1567. Neptune stands high on the top of the fountain, while around the basin are dolphins and sirens squeezing water out of their breasts. I just wish you could get a clear view of",
          "Outstanding statue but unfortunately it is currently covered with scaffolding and plastic sheets which make it very difficult to see. Best to go with a guide to get an explanation of the finer points of the statue.",
          "This fountain sadly is not functioning as well as those seen in the likes of the Trevi or Bernini in the Piazza Navona in Rome. It does however have a unique part in motoring history: the Trident held by Neptune is said to be the base origin of the famous Maserati emblem.",
          "You need to view this fountain with a guide. The hidden messages in the gestures and the history behind the sculpture need explaining for us to understand it fully. As it stands the sculpture is impressive and well executed, and brings a touch of interest to this section of the",
          "Its in the Heart of city. You can find the Roman architecture. Weekend you can find lots of activities going over there.",
          "Fantastic designed stature. Is sadly currently under casing of scaffolding means it's not easy to see but still a great place to start a tour of the city. Other sights within few hundred yards.",
          "The fountain was in the main Piazza within bologna. There is another fountain which offer drinking water. Many people sat around enjoying the fountain.",
          "We have moved to Bologna for a period of months from the US and it is one of , if not, our favorite cities ever. We will be hosting many visitors this summer and find that the statue will be cleaned and covered until December. While I understand the need for this maintenance, it",
          "you may have a little glimpse of Neptun, as he is all behind bars for reconstruction (May 2016). Not much to see here for the time being.",
          "Unfortunately the statute is completely surrounded by loads of scaffolding so it's difficult to see much!",
          "A big statue of Neptune and his mermaids - all are impressive surrounded by a fountain. A great tourist attraction.",
          "This is a beautiful fountain in a large, impressive square. usually, there are not too many tourists around it, so the fountain can be viewed in all its glory.",
          "You can't miss this as it is big and right in the square. Neptune is vast and the four female mermaids(?) have to be seen to be believed! Shame water isn't coming out of all the places it's clearly intended to be coming out of, but it's an incredible piece of baroque",
          "Wonderful centrepiece of the central square Maggiore. Very imposing and artistic. With it's own legends regarding Neptune's manhood and his sirens endowments! A must see and great photo opportunity.",
          "Why the raised eyebrow? I'm of a generation where a fountain with water spouting from breasts is a little risqu\u00e9. This fountain is in the middle of a square with plentiful restaurants but is quite a busy area. We visited in April so the summer crowds hadn't arrived. Around the",
          "Just a statue for the cameras. Not much to do there. Take a picture and move on. Bologna has more to offer than a statue in an almost deserted square.",
          "The fountain is great and is definately a landmark of Bologna. But the huge and powerful Neptune, with his huge body, has one part of his body unproportional small.... It was the decision of city authorities. But the sculptore did not resign and Neptun's hand is the trick. Look",
          "Beautiful fountain sitting in a beautifull piazza. Alot of photo opportunities justvaround eveey corner",
          "In central Bologna fountain with Neptune. Not as grand as some of the Roman fountains but still nice to see. Can fill your water bottle from an offshoot albeit very slowly. Had the somewhat unusual sight of someone using a stepladder to go round the fountain taking",
          "Great place for a memorable photo in the heart of Piazza Maggiore. Very well preserved fountain. Looks great in the night when lit.",

          "Nettuno it's one of the most popular symbols of the city center. When Bologna was \"the\" basket city in the 90's the baskeball supportrs used to celebrate the championships wins by running around it. It's placed in one of the most beatuful squares of the town, facin an ancient",

          "This was a below average fountain, nothing really special about it. If you didn't see it, you not missing out!!!!",
          "The fountain and the statue are really nice. It is part of piazza maggiore, so you cannot miss it while in Bologna.",
          "This lovely statue is located on the main square of Bologna's center. It is an area full of lovely shops, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, beautiful monuments and buildings.. So naturally it is an area for locals to meet and tourists to see. So it is lively even in cold dark",
          "Piazza Maggiore is the major town square in the center of Bologna, Italy. Crowded with students, visitors, cafes, gelateria, and pigeons, its a fun place to meet for coffee or aperitif. The fountain of Neptune is a beautiful statue of the sea god, Neptune, surrounded by",
          "Ok honestly mixed feelings... My boyfriend and I came here I think every single day of the trip to sit on the steps. We ate panini's there, drank our gelato frappes there, it was our go-to resting spot. However, be careful. My wallet got stolen from right next to me on these",
          "The fountain is fine, but be wary of the people offering to take your photo! You might end up paying Eur 10 for someone using your camera for 2 minutes ..",
          "It looks bigger on photo than is does in reality. Furthermore traffic is spoiling the view. It remains a nice entry to the piazza maggiore",
          "i loved this spot, especially because of the weekend's absense of cars,people everywhere around,walking, it was splendit!",
          "tHIS is an ideal spot for meeting up with friends etc., can't be missed or mistaken for anywhere else.... the fountain wasn't working whilst there. Used more for seating than anything else and a magnet for beggars of the area which was a bit disappointing as it was obvious that",
          "But I just wish the women fountains worked! That, as silly as it sounds, was the highlight! I had heard about the fountain before going and wanted to see it. Ah well, it was still a nice fountain.",

          "Giambologna originally made Neptune's penis too large for Cardinal Legate (the man who commissioned the fountain), and had to make it smaller as to not offend the church. So, mischievously, Giambologna positioned Neptunes left hand so that it appears as a large penis when you",

          "I guess Neptune's fountain is THE place to go to have your picture taken while in downtown Bolgna. It's a nice statue of Neptune along with various sea creatures including mermaids doing erotic things. You'll see that Maserati got their symbol from Neptune's trident.",
          "In my opinion, one of the most gentle and \"plastic\" bronze statues from good ol' times. Inscribed into a beautiful frame, Piazza del Nettuno.",
          "The fountain is no longer in working order, the water barely flows out of a few small hole at the very bottom. The monument was covered in pigeons at the top and surrounded by drunk people laying all over it at the bottom. Very disappointed! I'm sure it once was great but not",
          "nice fountain. for us, it resembles a lot with the ones in Florence. we expected a larger square around the fountain. many people surrounding the fountain.",
          "What a fountian. It's not often you see water spraying out of ladies bosoms and many other places. It is a brilliant piece of sculpture. A great place just to sit and listen to the water and watch the world go by. There normally part of it shaded at some time in the day.",
          "It is the landmark of the square! Visit it if and make your pictures for memories! It the best Nettuno sculpture of italy!",
          "This fountain stand right at the heart of the Plaza and lends it a regal character. Like many fountains across Italy its beautiful and is a nice photo spot. Worth looking at if you are in the area.",
          "amazing piece of art. Not to be missed ! For photo opportunity, you better go early morning or late at night. Too many people relaxing on its steps which does not complement the photo for sure.",
          "Where else but Bologna would you see a naked Neptune, sculptured fish, and some kind topless of 2-tailed mermaids all on a huge fountain? It really is something to see, especially when it is lit up at night. A true Bologna landmark.",
          "it is a really crowded place but if you go early in the morning you will get a lot of pictures all by yourself!the stroll all around the fountain is also beautifull",
          "This is a nice piazza, full of people. The design is unusual for Italy. We enjoyed the city but this area was a bit too crowded.",

          "Unique and Beautiful with spectacular sirens that must have been a bit controversial in the 16th century! Jean de Bologne is a great artist and his statues are always full of vitality.",
          "Here is where you meet for any encounter before exploring Bologna. Its at the entrance of the Piazza Maggiore and near cafes. From here in the heart of Bologna you can venture to restaurants, shopping on the Via Independenza or see the \"due torre\"",

          "I spent many hours in the Piazza del Nuttuno as I found it an exciting place to people watch. For the price of a bottle of wine and some snacks, you can laze away the afternoon at one of the restaurant tables and watch the ever exciting crowd of locals and tourists pass by.",
          "This small square is adjacent to Piazza Grande and, if one comes down the main road one can visit it before entering the bigger Piazza. It's worth visiting.",
          "The Bolognese are rightly proud of this great square which dominates the centre of their city. Even in the snow and rain, it was busy and bustling with visitors, workers and shoppers. The statue of Neptune is very impressive.",
          "This fountain is located in the main Piazza. The fountain is very pretty - though it could use a bit of a face lift. I suggest a stop!",
          "You would expect this fountain, the 'symbol' of Bologna, to be in the middle of the Piazza Maggiore, but it's tucked off to the side. The fountain no longer has water because of a massive freeze last winter when the pipes froze. No money yet to fix it. Pity. Bit of trivia:",
          "This is a lovely fountain in a lovely square. It is a meeting point in Bologna and it is often surrounded by people waiting for friends and family. Very charming by night.",
          "Maybe I'm just used to Rome's great fountains, but this old, tarnished looking statue without any real fountain was not even worth taking a photo. However the piazza around it is lovely.",
          "This area has lots of points to see like SALABORSA , Palazzo and churches . Very close to to towers Asinelli and Garisenda.",

          "nettuno's fountain was great to visit. even the piazza as a whole (piazza nettuno and piazza maggiore)...great music in the piazza as well",
          "There's an interesting story about a pope not liking how endowed Neptune was and instructed the sculptor to tone things down, so the sculptor put one of Neptune fingers at such an angle that when viewed just right he appears much more delighted than one would have originally",
          "This would have been much nicer had it been fully functional with water coming from all of the jets instead of a weak stream from just a few of them.",
          "I have written about this under the heading of the fontana in error. The piazza is an important place because of the war memorials.",
          "beautiful palazzo on one side of the fountain and war memorials on the other. We often found pamphlets on political issues being distributed here by people keen to discuss their causes. This seemed so appropriate in front of the memorial to people who lost their lives in",

          "We loved the Piazza on Saturday night. The whole town seemed abuzz hanging out in the Piazza, dining in an outdoor cafe, or on a gelato. The buildings/fountains are interesting in their own right. By day it was equally interesting and a center of activity. Great city!",
          "The Neptune fountain sits between the Piazza Maggiore and it's own Piazza del Nettuno. Without writing a book about this lovely fountain, it is a lovely bronze creation of the Renaissance by Jean Boulogne, known as Giambologna.Influenced by classical Greek sculpture and the work",
          "The fountain is pretty, but doesn't compare to many in Rome. However, the plaza was fun to see--in the evenings in June they showed free movies. Many were in English with Italian subtitles.",
          "This fountain is definitely not like Trevi Fountain.. However, it's still nice to see the Statue and what it represents",
          "Want to meet but don't know where? Everyone can find the Neptune statue on the piazza Nettuno. Neptune rules the waves but more importantly he stands out from all possible directions. Otherwise a little impressive statue.",
          "This fountain of Neptune is beautiful and a wonderful setting for photos and for relaxing in the sun. Cafes nearby, wonderful for the late afternoon to have an aperativo or gelato...I love to people watch...so many beautiful children, people from Bologna, and not overcrowed",

        "wiki": "The National Art Gallery of Bologna (Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna) is a museum in Bologna, Italy. It is located in the former Saint Ignatius Jesuit novitiate of the city's University district, and inside the same building that houses the Academy of Fine Arts. The museum offers a wide collection of Emilian paintings from the 13th to the 18th century and other fundamental works by artists who were in some way related to the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Accademia Clementina ===\nAccording to 18th-century Italian art historian Luigi Crespi, it was cardinal Prospero Lambertini, who would later become Pope Benedict XIV, the one who planned a Gallery for  altarpieces  in the churches of the city.\n\nThe gallery's first nucleus of works came from the acquisition in 1762 by monsignor Francesco Zambeccari of eight early 15th-century altarpieces, salvaged from the demolition of Saint Mary Magdalene's church. Bought for the Istituto delle Scienze, the art pieces were to be preserved by the Accademia Clementina, the Institute's artistic section. In 1776 a dozen of 13th-century altarpieces and Byzantine icons, which came from Urbano Savorgnan's legacy and formerly located at the Saint Philip Neri's Oratory, were also bought for the Accademia.\nAnother Bolognese conservation pole was the Appartamento del Gonfaloniere at the Palazzo Pubblico. From the late 16th century onwards, the Appartamento had been housing paintings from artists such as Vitale da Bologna, Raphael (The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia), Cima da Conegliano, Lorenzo Costa, Francesco Francia, Pietro Perugino (Madonna in Glory with Saints)  and Annibale Carracci, alongside works like the Pala del Voto by Guido Reni, preserved there for their high civic significance (another painting by Reni in the museum is the Massacre of the Innocents, 1611.\n\n\n=== Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts ===\nIn 1796, with the fall the Pope's regime and the new republican laws, which suppressed many convents and all the guilds, and shut down the old regime's head offices, the Bolognese senate decided to merge the suppressed churches' and convents' paintings and Accademia delle Scienze's holdings into one single collection, gathering almost one thousand works, organized first at the former Convent of Saint Vitalis, then in 1802 at the former Jesuit novitiate of Saint Ignatius in the Borgo della Paglia, now called via delle Belle Arti 56, made by Alfonso Torreggiani in 1726 to house the newly created gallery of National Academy of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\nWith the fall the Napoleonic empire in 1815, many works seized by the French were returned from the Louvre to the city. The first enlargement of the collection, carried out by Leandro Marcon dates back to this time. In 1826 Gaetano Giordani made the first catalog. The collection was enlarged again in 1844, when the museum now added the convent's chapel, which had ceiling frescoes depicting the Apotheosis of St Ignatius of Loyola. Between 1867 and 1868, many paintings coming from further suppressions were added. In 1875, the pinacoteca was opened regularly for the public, in 1882 the Gallery became autonomous and, in 1884 Zambeccari Collection was acquired.\nIn the first years of the 20th century another wing was built under the supervision of Edoardo Collamarini. In the late sixties the, under supervisor Cesare Gnudi and based on Leone Pancaldi's project, the Salone del Rinascimento was created to host the frescoes brought from the Sant'Apollonia di Mezzaratta church. In 1997 the Gallery was completely renovated to comply the European standards, and it is one of the best known Italian art galleries, internationally known and appreciated for its space dedicated exclusively to temporary exhibitions and for its educational activities.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\nG.P.

          "Rather nice Museum. While there are many not very interesting paintings in the first 15 rooms, to me the Reni room and a painting by Raffaelo were great.",

          "Among many precious 12th, 13th and 14 th century paintings you will find a room of Guido Reni and two Vassari that shows he was a serious painter besides a chronicler of his time and his more famous contemporaries. Notable paintings also by father and daughter Fontana. To get",
          "We enjoyed exploring the progression of art - from the 1300s forward. The majority of the pictures were religious. The rooms were well numbered and the art was nicely displayed. There was typically one sign that was in English for the room that provided an overview.",

          "Has an extensive collection of Bolognese church art from Giotto to Reni.Which is the strength, and weakness of the gallery. With so much of it , over 40 rooms, many works are quite average. And if you prefer a more balanced art gallery, with art from Giotto thru to 20th century",
          "Extremely rich art museum, dedicated mainly to local masters. Much of the museum is dedicated to local pre-Renaissance religious art. However, there are works by some of the great Renaissance masters. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "A reasonable collection of nice tryptichs, icons, religious art...well worth seeing it although the size of the collection hardly justifies the ever increasing entrance ticket.",
          "It was about 7 Euro to get in but definitely worth it. A really good variety and range of paintings arranged more or less chronologically. Loved the Guerchinos in particular. The museum itself is air conditioned in places. There are lockers for large bags as youare not allowed",
          "Before visiting, I should really have researched better what was in this art gallery. Because for me, this was an overdose of religious art, and we had already visited a number of churches with impressive art in-situ. It is all quality stuff, I just don't like looking at",
          "The building is carefully climate controlled to preserve these art pieces.It is located right next to the university's art school, so students have easy access. Highlights of the collection for me included A Giotto polyptych and Raphael's Ecstasy of Santa Cecelia,",
          "This place sounds as if it'll be better than it is. You hear they have Giotto and El Greco... but there's one Giotto, and it looked to me like it was done before Giotto developed the genius that made him revolutionise painting. Likewise the El Greco is a scrappy little thing,",
          "One of the countrys great collection 14,15,16,17,18th paintings. Nice gallery space. Might have been helpful to have had an audio guide because the information in each of the rooms or for each picture is very minimal",
          "Like Pinacoteca in Siena, this one - Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna is a great place/museum. I prefer this one and Siena one to much more famous Pinacoteca Brera in Milano. There were maybe only few people when I was there, so it was peaceful and you could really enjoy it.",
          "Lots of religious paintings, very beautiful if you like this kind of paintings. Students do not have to pay.",
          "If you are interested in Italian art, then do visit this gallery. Much of the collection is from the 13C to the 18C of art from Bologna. There are also good collection of Guido Reni and Caracci works.",
          "If you want to get away from the tourists in Bologna, and enjoy a close up view of some beautiful art, this is the place for you. There was hardly anyone there when we visited. We got the prize Giotto to ourselves and were able to sit and contemplate it in blissful peace. In",
          "We visited the Pinacoteca on our last day in Bologna and I wished we had gone earlier. This gallery holds the most amazing collection of sacred art - look out for the painting of St Petronas holding the city of Bologna in his hands. The tilting Garisenda tower was tilting back",
          "Great art gallery, one of the few in Italy where one can have the whole place to oneself. Off the tourist beaten track, nestled in a place built in the second half of the 15th century near the Accademia delle belle arti is a must for the art and history enthusiasts.",
          "This was a lovely surprise to visit this great museum. The paintings and the frescos are displayed in a very interesting way and the collection of paintings is of a very high quality. We loved the pinacoteca and will be sure to revisit on our next visit to Bologna Yona S.",
          "Although this is mostly Medieval & religious themed artwork, I thoroughly enjoyed our visit here and worth the 6 euro entrance fee. It was only a 15 min walk from Piazza Maggiore thus saving cab fare or figuring out which bus to take",
          "This was quiet museum where I could be alone with Perugino, Raphael, and Parmigianino. Delightful! The exterior is not well marked, however, and one might easily miss it.",
          "Pinacoteca Nazionale offers a nunique collection of paintings from 14th to 17th century. What is interesting about it, is its thematic unity. You can examine the development of style from late Medieval religious paintings to late Renaissance and Mannerism.",
          "I expected wonderful early paintings but these were outstanding in every way. Pseudo-Jacopino's works were filled with movement, colour, modelling, depth. While others had produced stiff little illustrations, Pseudo-Jacopino painted vivid glimpses of dancing, flying, rounded",
          "Very fine painting collection, focussing mainly on regional painters (of which there are many fine examples) with a few big names (representative rather than great works). The chronological arrangement was very helpful in understanding trends and styles, and the space was very",
          "Don't wear yourself with every picture! Look for Titian, Parmiginiano Cambiaso, and Costa Most important - Raphael.",
          "The Pinoteca Nazionale is a vast art gallery most notable for its pre- and early Renaissance religious paintings, including some stunning altarpieces aglow with gold leaf and vibrant reds, greens and blues. Proceeding through the galleries chronologically elucidates the",
          "I love the art gallery. It's never too crowded so it's possible to get some one on one time with the art works. A lot of the collection is religious art - which I love. If you look closely some of the Greek and Roman legends are represented as well.",
          "Worth the visit for one room which houses the fresci from a church. The museum has replicated the church itself. The paintings are wonderfully alive.",
          "I learned of this place from Andrew Graham Dixon's \"Italy Unpacked\" (TV prog) and came especially to see Guido Reni's \"The Massacre of the Innocents\". The gallery contains works from the 14Century onwards and mostly by local artists but also including very important works from",
          "The way the world is heading, it won't be long before every art gallery in the world has ultra-sensitive proximity alarms, jobsworth staff and a whole plethora of sensitive security measures - in order to \u201cprotect the art\u201d. This draconian, (but understandable), attitude could be",
          "If you are in Bologna, and if you have even the very minimum interest in Renaissance paintings, do not miss with very rich and well-organised collection of paintings from the 14th to 19th Century - the Renaissance section is the best represented, I think. You'll find works by",
          "must see gallery , masterpieces inside , renaissance and not only...10-15 minutes away from the train station by foot...",
          "We visited as the Festival Internationale Di Fumetto was in town. A great space to exhibit the comic artwork plus all the usual religious works. Good value for 6Euro.",
          "Begins with the 11 or 12 Century and gets to 17th Century. Much religious art by masters - Caracci, Vasari, Reni, etc. Stunning canvases in a modern setting, not always lit to best advantage. A very fulfilling experience and would have been a loss to have missed.",
          "A fine collection of religious art - but not much else. We had hoped to see more secular art by local artists - some but not much. Many of the pieces were not well illuminated and they need it.",
          "The gallery is in a newish building and part of the University. It has a good number of rather old religious paintings, many on wood panels. I feel the woodworm killer company must have had a good contract when they were appointed! As previous reviewers have pointed out, the",
          "Focuses mainly on late mediaeval and early Renaissance artists mainly from the local region, most of whom are little known outside of Italy. But the works are stunning. Frustrating that there was no accompanying book - in English or even Italian.",
          "Too.expensive for what it offers. Not that great a selection of paintings. We all expected so much more. A dissapointment.",
          "The emphasis of this gallery is religious art. Most of the artists are of the local Bolognese school, but there are a few works by world famous painters such as El Greco and Raphael. Some of the accompanying descriptions are in English but it helps if you have some familiarity",
          "There are 29 rooms in the gallery, which means it's not a huge one, but it took us more than 2.5 hours to get round it. There are some very interesting and beautiful paintings, and the early works are particularly interesting. It's not for those who don't like religious art , as",
          "If you enjoy early artwork this is an exceptional collection of pieces - It's not overly large so makes a pleasant hour or two of viewing.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this pinacoteca. It is well laid out, the reviewers who say it wasn't obviously didn't follow the clear numbering of rooms from 1 to 29, almost completely in chronological order. Most of the artists may not be well known, but there are some beautiful",
          "This art gallery is amazing if you love Medieval and Renaissance Art. There are some great works in here. It's not very expensive to get in as all. There is so much to see take your time or you will get to saturation level. It's not to far from the centre of town so don't be",
          "We like to go to art museums and so of course the BNP was on the list. I hate to sound like a philistine, but I find it very helpful when a museum's collection is laid out chronologically - it makes it easier to grasp what went on. The collection goes from some unusual medieval",
          "The art gallery is in the university quarter of the city, and the area is full of small bars and cafes and trattoria. It's not big, and it has a limited range of 13th-18th c. works of painters who worked in the Bologna region - but it's well-organised and well hung and lit. The",
          "we were lucky enough to get here during the museum night - sadly the guided tour was a) full and b) in italian but that didn't stop us having a very interesting wander around. Particularly good if you are interested in the religious art of 12-15 centuries and I thought it gave",
          "some few good pieces, some few interesting ones, and a lot of square meters not worth to mention... For the first two rainy days in Bologna, there are better alternatives. Maybe on the third rainy day you will show up here.",
          "The museum shows a beautiful chronological survey of paintings made in Bologna from the 13th up to the 18th century. Highlights are Giotto, Raphael and Carracci. I especially loved the gothic altarpieces often with the crowning of the Virgin as central theme. Schedule 1.5h to",
          "If one is discerning, there are a number of interesting pieces here. Some of the early art had rather graphic depictions of Devils, souls in hell, skulls, etc.",
          "Very nice gallery with lots of interesting pictures. Well laid out and interesting. Handy for a rainy day.",
          "The Giotto was on loan and they close half the galleries in the afternoon so I couldn't see the Rafael. The museum features the Carracci brothers, so it is a great place if you are a fan. The interior is well laid out and some of the exhibition space is beautiful. It is",
          "This gorgeous collection is,as very often in Italy, but unexpected in a rich city like Bologna, shown in a scandalously unflattering way. Many light bulbs dead, others lighting up a piece of wall next to a painting. When a bit better aimed, they create bothersome",
          "A compact gallery - mostly religious paintings. Good way to see the work of local painters. Not terribly crowded but obviously popular with locals as well as tourists.",
          "Great art museum with good medieval to baroque art (that's when I stop looking at it). Not too crowded.",
          "There are some very good works here on display, but the content is 95% biblically themed with an inordinate number of crucifixion scenes that wear on you after awhile. The occasional portrait was a well welcomed treat. 4 euros on a rainy day though was not a bad stroll through",
          "I think most people could enjoy the art here, but it may be particularly enjoyable for the art lover. They display the art in roughly chronological order, which helps see the development of art on the Bologna region. As some people have noted, there are works of art by masters",
          "We were looking for an indoor activity on a rainy Sunday and were lucky to enough to come here on the day of the month that they offer free admission. On this visit, we spent our time mostly in the galleries with late medieval and early Renaissance pieces. I was struck by the",
          "Lovely modernized old building. Went to see Rafael's St. Cecila- on lone to show in Milan, disappointing. A few nice paintings but not to my liking. Parts of museum opened at different times because of staffing problems. Good for a rainy day.",
          "We were promised Raffaello - out on loan until 2016 ; Giotto - out on loan; Tintorello - out on loan; a \"late masterpiece of Titian\" - out on loan. We did find \"one of the few examples in Italy of El Greco\" which, despite its size of not much bigger than a large postcard, way",
          "Good historical selection of religious paintings. Highlights for me were St George rescuing the Princess (from the dragon), and St Cecilia by Raphael.",
          "Really enjoyed the visit to the historical art gallery not to be missed architecture and fabulous pieces of work. However all information is in Italian, but this didn't ruin our visit.",
          "Not really my thing, but my husband wanted to visit. The gallery is well laid out and the art is quite beautiful. Worth visiting if you like Italian art or if you get a rainy day!",
          "The collection is almost entirely of religious pictures mostly by not-quite-top-rated artists. The very occasional portrait or landscape comes as a relief. The one Raphael of St Cecilia doesn['t, for me, quite make up for the sameness of the rest.",
          "We went this time again and was this time again very happy. It is very well organized, if this gallery would be in Rome, most probably you would wait hours to get in. Here in Bologna was very calm, almost no visitors, but they have an excellent collection and it is a must to see.",
          "If you like religious paintings like I do, you will love this gallery, but if you don't, you will be disappointed. The size of the gallery is good for a visit that lasts 1-2 hours, and it's not that crowded, so you will have plenty of time to admire these works of art. The most",
          "Fabulous gallery, well laid out with some very extrodinary work by female artists. Thrilled to see Lavinia Fontana so proudly displayed!",
          "- There are many many paintings in the Gallery, I liked a lot. - --- This is not a very large gallery / collection like the big ones but those kept are very good. - If you love paintings particularly the older ones -till impressionists (not modern ) and if you are in Bologna",
          "This is an interesting and well laid out gallery. Don\u2019t expect to see lots of famous artists, but the medieval altarpieces are well worth a look. You can take photos, without a flash or tripod. The gallery is off the beaten track for tourists, but it\u2019s an easy walk from Due Tori",
          "Unless you're into no-name religious works, you risk disappointment if the big-name works have been sent out to exhibitions. It would be nice to be warned before handing over the admission fee!",
          "A very relaxing space, and well laid out galleries. The flow of work from early medieval through the renaissance really shows how artists developed their work. The restored frescoes were very interesting. Of course the majority of work is religious- because that's where the",
          "A brilliantly executed exhibition of the history of bolognese painters and the evolution of their styles. If you are interested in art, it is well worth a trip. The admission fee is also quite reasonable. We truly enjoyed our visit.",
          "A little further away from the center. Great collection of Italian medieval and renaissance paintings. Worth the walk, no question!",
          "After visiting the Prado in March and making a return visit after several years to the National Gallery in Washington, DC, I have been especially enjoying seeing paintings this year. The National Picture Gallery is certainly world-class. The focus is more on artists active in",
          "ended up staying a full afternoon. great painting collection. Pinacoteca is not that big and it could use an outside (or even inside) caffe for refreshments. still worth the visit",
          "A pleasant and extensive art gallery, which gave me an appreciation for the Bolognese school (actually I thought there were several works there better than the highly touted Raphael) Without crowd, one can take some time with the art, and with a little effort learn something",
          "Some good paintings, but sadly a lot of pious mediocrity. Certainly not a must-see!At least the layout is much better than when I was last here 15 years ago.",
          "If you love early Renaissance paintings, and I do, the Pinacoteca will not disappoint. The collection is unusually large and unusually fine, and the pieces are all beautifully framed and displayed. This was a highlight of my time in Bologna.",
          "A gallery that contains the city's most important art. Such artists here are Raffaello, Parmigianino and Perugino.",
          "This is a marvelous museum near the University of Bologna, a beautiful building with an impressive collection of paintings.",
          "The works are well displayed in a spacious Museum sparsely attended. They are arranged in chronological order and many are monumental in size including huge frescoes. Pictures without flash are allowed .",
          "Found the lay out and the various rooms difficult to follow, and whilst some of the leaflet guides were in English many of the rooms had no guides at all. Also I felt the entrance way should have been clearer to follow. I had to persevere up two flights of steps to enter with",
          "The selectio of Italian art is awsome. The restoration of the artwork is impressive. We had a great guide who had a good knowledge of all the most important pieces in the gallery. Allow plenty of time as you will not realise how the time will fly by when you are there.",
          "There are a few beautiful Giotos and Tinttoretos that I really liked. The museum is nice and is defenetly worth a visit",
          "The Pinacoteca Nazionale has a nice collection of Italian masters, especially 17th century Bolognese artists, and is well worth a visit. The paintings are grouped in periods and hung in a series of spacious, uncrowded rooms and galleries. Unfortunately, the museum doesn't",
          "The Pinacoteca has a good collection that is interestingly displayed... not as large as the museums you might find in other Italian cities but several great pieces by the masters. Giotto, Raphael, Titian... many more. A wonderful hour or two. Well worth a visit.",
          "Only small but a nice way to kill an hour. Highlights were Giottos Polyptych and the works by Guido Reni. Also fun to try and spot images of Bologna in the works!",
          "The paintings in this city museum are well hung and lit. There are some good early renaissance paintings but the main strength of the collection are the Bolognese painters of the 17th century, too busy and big for my taste, but worth getting to know.",
          "First of all, don't believe opening hours posted on their website - they are NOT open 9AM-7PM. We visited the gallery on Friday and it was open 2PM-7PM (but part of the gallery closes at 3:30 PM when another part opens - really confusing, but I assume it's for the good of the",
          "When you evaluate that Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna has over twenty rooms with a numerous paintings from different periods, you can understand that that museums keeps real treasure. It was not busy in there, so I felt truly pleasant.",
          "Really great gallery with enormous number of paintings divaided in different periods. There is a lot of space and pictures are nicely positioned.",
          "I come to the Pinacoteca quite often, when I need good vibes and new inspirations for my works or for my thoughts",
          "A gallery of wonders. Giotto, Raphael, Tintoretto, Titian. And a host of unsung artists from the late middle ages and early Renaisance who outshine the later masters with their inventive detail and sincerity. The most amazing thing is that you can see them all, up close, hung",
          "If you into religious pictures you will be in heaven (excuse the pun) Part of it open for some of the time then that closes and another part opens. Odd",
          "Initially we missed the entrance as the gallery was closed for lunch, but eventually found it (we thought that there was minimal signage). For a very reasonable entrance fee of 4 euro, we saw some very beautiful early 14th century art, in particular the highlight of the visit",
          "The museum mostly consists of local Bolognese artists, including the famous Carracci family. There are some jewels in the collection - a decent Raphael and a fantastic Perugino.",
          "This was to be the highlight of my museum visits, but it wasn't. Not because the beautiful art isn't there, but because I go to museums to learn about art and the Pinacoteca is very short on information both in Italian and other languages. There is NO audio guide! How is this",
          "You like Medieval art? You know, crucifixes, gilding, saints, angels and Madonnas, Satan down there in hell at the Last Judgment, etc. THIS IS THE PLACE. The art is stunning, beautiful, well displayed, worth every minute you'll spend here (almost alone). And while you're at it,",
          "Last week I was in Bologna, I had time and I visited the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna. I read something about it before going and I was a bit 'prepared. The Pinacoteca is located in the same historic building of the Accademia di Belle Arti. Its interior was a real",

          "It's quite common in Europe for museums to be closed on Mondays. Most internet sites, including their own, say that this museum is open every Tuesday to Sunday, in other words every day except Monday. Consequently we visited on the first Sunday in September. Annoyingly, there",
          "As has been the case with other reviewers, we found a nearly empty museum on our visit. The works are sumptuous, well presented, and seemed to us more accessible than one usually finds with such a high quality collection. Most certainly worth a visit if you like 14th-18th",
          "What a great surprise ! the pinacoteca has an amazing collection , my partner and I were absorbed for hours with the works in this museum. Incredible frescos, bizarre paintings, incredible collection of Carracci brothers work. This was our favorite art experience in Bologna, and",
          "I am not usually a great fan of medieval art, preferring something a little later, but the collection here is magnificent and the vast majority is just hung on the walls - no glass - so that one can get very close indeed. The collection is in chronological order so that the",

          "One of the best museums in Italy to see a chronological arrangement of Italian painting from the 13th through 18th centuries...Bologna and Emilia was always an important center for the arts, and though some of the painters may be less familiar than the Tuscans, that's our fault,",
          "We visited the museum on 26 May 2010. The museum is a ten to fifteen minute walk from the main Piazza, just beyond the main university buildings, along Via Zamboni, at the junction with Via Belle Arti, located in the Pinacoteca building (no 56). You need to leave rucksacks",
          "This is Bologna's most important museum. It houses paintings by major painters in Bologna area including Reni, Albani, Caracci and so on. To visit this museum is to open the door to understanding the painting style in Bologna. This museum is also one of the few which allow"

          "For the price of 6 Euro to spend about 1,5 h in this Gallery it is not to expensive. You can't maybe see many pieces of really famous painters but it ist still worth to go there. The biggest disadvantage in all museums of Bologna is lack of english descriptions",

        "wiki": "The Archaeological Civic Museum of Bologna (Italian: Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna) is located in the fifteenth-century Palazzo Galvani building at Via dell'Archiginnasio 2 postal code 40124 Bologna, once known as the Hospital of Death. Founded in September 1881 by the merging of two separate museums: the one belonging to the University of Bologna \u2013 heir of the Room of Antiquity belonging to the Academy of Sciences founded by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili in (1714) \u2013 and that belonging to the City of Bologna (enriched by the antique collection of Artist Pelagio Palagi (1860) and the large amount of finds from excavations conducted in and around Bologna during these times.\nThis museum is among the most important in archeological finds in Italy and is highly representative of the local history from prehistoric period to Roman Age. Additionally, its ancient Egyptian collection is among the most important in Europe. Between 1972 and 2012 the Museum has housed over 150 exhibitions with focus on archeology but also on arts.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== The Prehistoric Section ===\nOut on exposition are materials from the Lower Paleolithic Age (almost 700,000 years ago) until the Late Bronze Age (10th century B.C.)\u201d. The Paleolithic times are documented by items made of flint and chert: bi-facial choppers, points, scrapers, and cores. However, items representing the  Mesolithic Age (11,000 years ago) and Neolithic Age (4,500 to 3,000 years ago), are more scarce. With the Bronze Age, finds became more frequent as testified by the numerous ceramic containers, tools made of  bone, horn and metal, discovered, together with the casting moulds, in the big villages on the plain during the early half of the second millennium BC. The section is completed by prehistoric materials coming from Italy, Europe, and beyond.\n\n\n=== The Etruscan Section ===\n\nThis section of the museum displays material from diggings from the 19th and mid 20th centuries done within the Bolognese area and deals with the reconstruction of the development of the ancient settlement of the Etruscan civilization from its origins (9th century B.C.) to the founding of the city of Felsina (the settlement of Bologna during Etruscan times) between the middle of the 6th and 5th centuries B.C.\nThe oldest phases of the Etruscan Bologna (Villanovan and Orientalising, from the 9th to the middle of the 6th century B.C.) are illustrated by the vast selection from the approximately 4,000 tomb kits discovered: vases characterised by a bi-conical form (for the deposition of the ashes of the dead), objects for personal use and bronze tools, pottery and bronze vases. Among the many pieces on display one may find: the Benacci askos, a very rare vase typology used to contain the oil for the lanterns and the \u201ccloset of Saint Frances\u201d i.e. the deposit of a foundry made of a big vase (dolium) containing more than 14,000 bronze pieces.\nThe urban phase of Felsina (mid 6th century B.C. - beginning of the 4th century B.C.) is primarily represented by tomb kits. Some standouts are the \u201cTomba grande\u201d (Great Tomb) and the \u201cTomba dello sgabello\u201d (Tomb of the footstool)  coming from the rich necropolis of Giardini Margherita. They include some fine vases from Greece for drinking wine, others were luxury goods like a large candle holder or a seat made of ivory. Worth mentioning is also the \u201cCertosa's Situla\u201d, a refined bronze container decorated with scenes of military, civic, and religious life.\nA room is dedicated to the Villanovan culture of Verucchio (the main site of  Romagna of the first Iron Age) where a prince tomb is on display characterised by small tables for offerings, china, a throne with a wooden footrest, all perfectly preserved.\n\n\n=== The Celtic Section ===\nThe Etruscan society ended in Bologna during the beginning of the 4th century B.C. with a Celtic invasion that occupied a great part of Italy north of the Apennines and the Marche region. The Boi tribe settled in the Bolognese area. This section displays the most important kits of the Celtic necropolises in Bologna, characterized by the presence of traditional trans-Alpine iron weapons and the use of Etruscan-made fine china for banquets.\n\n\n=== The Lapidarium ===\nThe larger part of the contents in this section are Roman tombstones coming from Bologna and its surroundings dated between the 1st century B.C. and the mid 2nd century A.D.  Emperor Nero's statue with cuirass might be of particular interest (mid 1st century a.d.) discovered during the 15th century at the seat of the destroyed Roman theater, Piazza de' Celestini.  Also present in the courtyard a series of milestones of the via Emilia road.\n\n\n=== The Greek Collection ===\n\nHere on display is the most representative find of the Palagi Collection: the head of Lemnia Athena,  a marble copy of Augustan times of a bronze statue made by Fidia during the 5th century B.C. Also the other marbles finds on display are mainly Roman remakes of original Greek pieces. The Greek ceramics collection is very rich, most pieces are of Attic make and, along with others, of Magna Graecia make.\nAlso valuable are the finds of jewellery and antique and modern gems. Two computer stations are available for the consultation of this section's database.\n\n\n=== The Roman Collection ===\nThis one is a large collection of glass table wear, shaped bronzes, and domestic instruments such as keys, pots, needles, spoons, bells, weights, scales, and more fine china. The series on Early-Christian ivory art (diptychs and ciborias), decorated with sacred and profane motives (5th century B.C.). The marble sculptures are statues and public and private portraits, documents of the activity of the Roman shops during imperial times.\n\n\n=== Egyptian Collection ===\n\nWith 3,500 objects on display, the museum's Egyptian collection is among the most important in Europe. The sarcophagi, the stele, and ushabti all document three-thousand years of a society. The modern staging of these makes for a chronological order, starting from the Old Kingdom all the way to the Ptolemaic period, with sections of further investigation on areas of particular interest. Among those are funeral instruments, scriptures, and amulets. More over, the most-noted discoveries from most important excavations are those that come from the tomb of Horemheb, located in Saqqara (13th century BC) \u2013 a recently uncovered monument to which the museum dedicates a computer-graphic video.\n\n\n=== The Numismatic Collection ===\nThe Archeological Museum also prizes a wide numismatics collection of nearly 100,000 specimen of coins, medals,  and other coinage. Among the most important collections, noted are the consistent cores of the Roman samples (from the republican and imperial times), samples from Italian coin-making factories, and the cores from papal medallions. The database of this collection is not available to the public but can be consulted by making an appointment with museum.\n\n\n=== The Collection of plaster casts ===\nIt is a collection of plaster copies of celebrated Roman and Greek sculptures.\n\n\n== Services ==\nThe Museum is endowed with the following: an educational department, a specialized library with a reading lounge, a historic archive (available for consultation with an appointment), a photographic archive (also available for consultation with appointment or by written request), a restoration lab, special access for disabled visitors, rooms for temporary expositions, a conference room, and a bookshop.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Archaeological Museum of Bologna\".

          "There is not much to see. Only 3 exhibitions are open (as of the time I went) and they are all mostly boring. The Egyptian exhibit was kind of cool, but the guard sitting in the building kept saying \u201cshh\u201d to us when we were quietly talking and no one else was even in the",
          "Well, just 3 sections were available. They do have good set of Egyptian collection. Pottery from prehistoric period with some items from the bronze could be seen as well. Most part of the museum have been closed for restoration since 2017. As a result not much could be seen.",

          "Because these works require close-up attention to all the fascinating details, we only managed half of the Hokusai show in London. Exhaustion set in, so we were surprised and delighted to have an opportunity to continue. It has all the famous prints, 36 views of Fuji, inc the",

          "Like all the major museums in Bologna, this one is impressive and well worth visiting. However, what stands out at the moment is the fact that it is hosting the Egitto - Millennia of Splendour exhibition, which is on until July 2016. It is without doubt one of the best curated",

          "We were surprised to see the unique collection of Etruskan art. It's amazing and too vast to comprehend. Lots of beautiful works of art from ages before Christ. The Egyptian collection is also very interesting. If you are at Bologna, visit this museum. It's really worthwhile!",

          "It is a nice museum worth a visit. It's quite big and has a big collection. I liked the Egyptian section with sarcophagus and hieroglyphics.They have big amounts of rocks and that wasn't so cool because I didn't found a big pile of rocks particularly interesting. Another minus",

        "wiki": "On 27 June 1980, Itavia Flight 870 (IH 870, AJ 421), a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 passenger jet en route from Bologna to Palermo, Italy, crashed into the Tyrrhenian Sea between the islands of Ponza and Ustica, killing all 81 people on board. Known in Italy as the Ustica massacre (\"strage di Ustica\"), the disaster led to numerous investigations, legal actions and accusations, and continues to be a source of controversy, including claims of conspiracy by the Italian government and others. The Prime Minister of Italy at the time, Francesco Cossiga, attributed the crash to being accidentally shot down during a dogfight between Libyan and NATO fighter jets. A 1994 report argued the cause of the crash was a terrorist bomb, one in a years-long series of bombings in Italy. On 23 January 2013, Italy's top criminal court ruled that there was \"abundantly\" clear evidence that the flight was brought down by a missile, but the perpetrators are still missing.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\n\nThe aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 flown as Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870, was manufactured in 1966 and acquired by the airline on 27 February 1972 with the serial number CN45724/22 and registration I-TIGI (formerly N902H, operated by Hawaiian Airlines).\n\n\n== Flight history ==\nOn 27 June 1980 at 20:08 CEST, the plane departed with a delay of one hour and 53 minutes from Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport for a scheduled service to Palermo Punta Raisi Airport, Sicily. With 77 passengers aboard, Captain Domenico Gatti and First Officer Enzo Fontana were at the controls, with two flight attendants. The flight was designated IH 870 by air traffic control, while the military radar system used AJ 421.Contact was lost shortly after the last message from the aircraft was received at 20:37, giving its position over the Tyrrhenian Sea near the island of Ustica, about 120 kilometres (70 mi) southwest of Naples. At 20:59 CEST, the aircraft broke-apart in mid-air and crashed.\nTwo Italian Air Force F-104s were scrambled at 21:00 from Grosseto Air Force Base to locate the accident area and search for any survivors, but failed to do so because of poor visibility.Floating wreckage and bodies were later found in the area. There were no survivors among the 81 people on board.\n\n\n== Official investigation ==\nAfter years of investigation, no official explanation or final report has been provided by the Italian government. In 1989, the Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism, headed by Senator Giovanni Pellegrino, issued an official statement concerning the disappearance of Flight 870, which became known as the \"Ustica Massacre\" (Strage di Ustica).\nThe investigatory phase of the case has suggested that:\n\"the action is primarily an act of war, a de facto unreported war \u2013 as is usual from Pearl Harbor onwards, until the last Balkan conflict \u2013 an international police operation, in fact, accruing to the great powers, since there was no mandate in this sense; a non-military coercive action exercised lawfully or illicitly, from one State against another; or act of terrorism, as it was later wished, of an attack on a head of state or regime leader.\"{Ordinanza-sentenza, 1999, p. 4965}\nThe perpetrators of the crime remain unidentified. The court, unable to proceed further, declared the case archived.\nIn July 2006, the re-assembled fragments of the DC-9 were returned to Bologna from Pratica di Mare Air Force Base near Rome.\nIn June 2008, Rome prosecutors reopened the investigation into the crash after former Italian President Francesco Cossiga (who was prime minister when the incident occurred) said that the aircraft had been shot down by French warplanes. On 7 July 2008, a claim for damages was served to the French President.\n\n\n=== High treason charges against Italian Air Force officials ===\nThe role of Italian Air Force personnel in the tragedy is unclear. Several Air Force officials have been investigated and brought to court for a number of alleged offences, including falsification of documents, perjury, abuse of office and aiding and abetting. Four generals were charged with high treason, on the allegations that they obstructed government investigation of the accident by withholding information about air traffic at the time of Ustica disaster.\nThe first ruling, on 30 April 2004, pronounced two of the generals, Corrado Melillo and Zeno Tascio, not guilty of high treason. Lesser charges against a number of other military personnel were also dropped. Other allegations could not be pursued further after the expiration of the statute of limitations, as the disaster had occurred more than 15 years prior. For this same reason, action could not be taken against the other two generals, Lamberto Bartolucci and Franco Ferri. However, the ruling did not acquit them, and they were still alleged to be guilty of treason. In 2005, an appeals court ruled that the accusations were made on a complete absence of evidence. On 10 January 2007, the Italian Court of Cassation upheld this ruling and conclusively closed the case, fully acquitting Bartolucci and Ferri of any wrongdoing.\nIn June 2010, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano urged all Italian authorities to cooperate in the investigation of the incident.In September 2011, a Palermo civil tribunal ordered the Italian government to pay 100 million euros ($137 million) in civil damages to the relatives of the victims for failing to protect the flight, concealing the truth and destroying evidence.On 23 January 2013, the Civil Cassation Court ruled that there was \"abundantly\" clear evidence that the flight was brought down by a stray missile, confirming the lower court's order that the Italian government must pay compensation.In April 2015, an appeals court in Palermo confirmed the rulings of the 2011 Palermo civil tribunal and rejected an appeal by the state attorney.\n\n\n== Hypotheses on the causes ==\nSpeculation at the time and in the years since has been fueled in part by media reports, military officials' statements and ATC/CVR recordings. Adding to the widespread conjecture was the observation of radar images showing trails of objects moving at high speeds.\n\n\n=== Terrorist bomb ===\nAfter the series of bombings that hit Italy in the 1970s, a terrorist act was the first explanation to be proposed. As the flight was delayed in Bologna by almost three hours, a bomb's timer may have been set to actually cause an explosion at the Palermo airport, or on a further flight of the same plane. The technical commission supporting a 1990 judicial enquiry reported that an explosion in the rear toilet, and not a missile strike, was the only conclusion supported by the wreckage analysis.Fourteen years after the accident, a 1994 joint investigation was carried out by the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Italian investigators; this team included veteran British Air Accident Investigator A. Frank Taylor and Engineer Goran Lilja of Sweden. The team was surprised that anyone came to any conclusion with so little of the aircraft recovered and asked the Italian government to fund another salvage operation to recover more of the aircraft from the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. While investigating the 21 December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, A.Frank Taylor helped create a software program that could locate widely scattered debris. This software program had two effects, 1) how far a piece will travel in the direction that the aircraft was originally traveling, and 2) how far the piece will be blown downwind. An additional 40% of the aircraft wreckage was located within a few meters of where the software program predicted it would be found. The location of the wreckage on the sea floor demonstrated which pieces came off the aircraft first.The investigation found conclusive physical evidence (as per the wreckage recovered) that a bomb had indeed exploded mid-flight in the rear lavatory. A large section of the aircraft's fuselage around the lavatory was never recovered (presumably having disintegrated in the explosion). A test explosion in a DC-9 lavatory showed the resulting deformation in the surrounding structure to be almost identical to that of the incident aircraft.\nFrom \u201cA Case History Involving Wreckage Analysis: Lessons from the Ustica investigations\u201d\n4 Investigation Findings\n4.1 It was concluded that the accident was brought about by in-flight break- up resulting from extensive structural damage caused by the detonation of an explosive charge in the rear (starboard) toilet.\n4.2 The charge was probably located in the outer wall of the toilet although other nearby positions cannot be ruled out.\n4.3 For the preferred position the charge would most probably have been inserted via the tissue holder just forward of station 801 and pushed rearwards to lie to the rear of the frame at station 801 and at a height at or just above the lower skin of the adjacent engine pylon.\n4.4 Other less likely but possible and accessible positions include either inside the toilet waste tank, via the waste hole, or on top of it, via the cupboard under the wash basin.However, the Italian high courts dismissed this final report as insignificant to their own investigation, and the report was never considered.\n\n\n=== Missile strike during military operation ===\nMajor sources in the Italian media have alleged that the aircraft was shot down during a dogfight involving Libyan, United States, French and Italian Air Force fighters in an assassination attempt by NATO members on an important Libyan politician, perhaps even Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was flying in the same airspace that evening. This version was supported in 1999 by investigative magistrate Rosario Priore, who said in his concluding report that his investigation had been deliberately obstructed by the Italian military and members of the secret service, in compliance with NATO requests.According to the Italian media, documents from the archives of the Libyan secret service passed on to Human Rights Watch after the fall of Tripoli show that Flight 870 and a Libyan MiG were attacked by two French jets.On 18 July 1980, 21 days after the Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870 incident, the wreckage of a Libyan MiG-23, along with its dead pilot, was found in the Sila Mountains in Castelsilano, Calabria, southern Italy, according to official reports.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\nSeveral conspiracy theories explaining the disaster persist. For example, the vessel that carried out the search for debris on the ocean floor was French, but only US officials had access to the aircraft parts they found. \nSeveral radar reports were erased and several Italian generals were indicted 20 years later for obstruction of justice. The difficulty the investigators and the victims' relatives had in receiving complete, reliable information on the Ustica disaster has been popularly described as un muro di gomma (literally, a rubber wall), because investigations just seemed to \"bounce back\".\n\n\n== Memorial ==\n\nOn 27 June 2007, the Museum for the Memory of Ustica was opened in Bologna. The museum is in possession of parts of the plane, which are assembled and on display, including almost all of the external fuselage. The museum also has objects belonging to those on board that were found in the sea near the plane. \nChristian Boltanski was commissioned to produce a site-specific installation.\nThe installation consists of:\n\n81 pulsing lamps hanging over the plane\n81 black mirrors\n81 loudspeakers (behind the mirrors)Each loudspeaker describes a simple thought/worry (e.g. \"when I arrive I will go to the sea\")\nAll the objects found are contained in a wooden box covered with a black plastic skin.\nA small book with the photos of all objects and various information is available to visitors upon request.\n\n\n== Dramatization ==\nThe accident was featured in the 13th season of the Canadian documentary series Mayday in an episode entitled \"Massacre over the Mediterranean\". The film examined the heavy public pressure placed upon investigators to uncover the cause of the accident, and also considered the three separate technical investigations that occurred. It ultimately advanced the conclusions of the third and final technical investigation, which concluded that the wreckage ruled out a missile and pointed to an explosion in or near the rear lavatory.The documentary was highly critical of the Italian judiciary's failure to officially release the third technical investigation to the public, or to consider its conclusion that missiles were not responsible. Interviewee David Learmount of Flight International magazine made the following comments:\n\nThe judiciary in Italy just found Frank Taylor's findings inconvenient. I don't think they ordered it not to be published, they just made a decision that they wouldn't publish it.\nI'm sorry, but Italy is a dreadful place to have an aviation accident. If you want the truth, you're less likely to find it there than just about anywhere else in the world.\nFrank Taylor's team didn't reach any conclusions except ones which were based on hard physical evidence. There was no theorizing going on.\nFrank Taylor, a British investigator involved in the third technical inquest, also commented:\n\nWe discovered quite clearly that somebody had planted a bomb there, but nobody on the legal side, it would appear, believed us and therefore, so far as we are aware, there has been no proper search for who did it, why they did it, or anything else. As an engineer and an investigator I cannot see why anybody would want to consider anything other than the truth.\nA 1991 Italian film by Marco Risi, The Rubber Wall, tells the story of a journalist in search of answers to the many questions left open by the accident. The film theorises on a few possible scenarios, including the possibility that the DC-9 was mistakenly shot down during an aerial engagement between NATO and Libyan jet fighters.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1956 B-47 disappearance\nAir France Flight 1611\nCold War (1979\u20131985)\nList of unsolved deaths\nNotable decompression accidents and incidents\nOperation Gladio\nStrategy of tension\nYears of Lead (Italy)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site of the Association of the Relatives of the Victims of the Accident (dead link)\nAirDisaster.Com Accident Synopsis of Flight 870\nAccident details at planecrashinfo.com\nIl Muro di gomma on IMDb, film about the accident\nThe mystery of flight 870 \u2013 Guardian Newspaper.\nhttps://www.webcitation.org/6SAEPRdmq?url=http://aviation-safety.net/pubs/other/Taylor_paper_Ustica_illustrated.pdf",

        "wiki": "Palazzo d'Accursio (or Palazzo Comunale) is a palace once formulated to house major administrative offices of the city of Bologna, region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy. It is located on the Piazza Maggiore, and is the city's Town Hall. The palace is also home to the Civic Art Collection, with paintings from the Middle Ages to the 19th century; the Museo Morandi, with the works by Giorgio Morandi; and the Biblioteca Salaborsa, the town libraries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest structure of the  Palazzo d'Accursio originally began as the residence of the jurist Accursius, but over time, it incorporated and expanded to include adjacent buildings to house civic offices. In 1336 it became the seat of the Anziani (\"Elders\"), the highest magistrates of the commune, and then seat of the government. In the 15th century it was refurbished under the designs of the architect Fioravante Fioravanti, who added the Clock Tower (Torre d'Accursio). The bell in the tower was installed by Gaspare Nadi. Further reconstruction occurred in the 16th century, after the fall from power of Bentivoglio family in Bologna.\nIn 1920, in a period of turmoil in Italy caused by the rise of the Italian Socialist Party in the wake of the end of World War I, and the initial violences of the Italian Fascist Party, numerous people were killed while a session of the local council was being held inside the palace. Some were shot by Fascist who had invaded the square in front of the palace, firing against Socialist demonstrators, and some by Socialists themselves, who inadvertedly threw hand grenades against their fellows from the palace's windows. Further, when news of the massacre in the square reached the meeting, Socialist politicians shot a member of the Liberal Party who also taking part in the council, killing him, while others were also wounded.\n\n\n== Art and architecture ==\nThe fa\u00e7ade features a portcullis and a Madonna with Child, a terracotta by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca (1478) in the upper section. Over the portal is a large bronze statue of the Bolognese Pope Gregory XIII (1580). A bronze statue of Pope Boniface VIII, once here, is now in the Medieval Museum.\nThe Hall of the Communal Council, on the first floor, is where the Bolognese Senate met, and contains a gallery ceiling frescoed with Baroque-style quadratura by Angelo Michele Colonna and Gioacchino Pizzoli (1675\u20131677). The ceiling depicts the following scenes:\nMinerva (goddess of knowledge)\nMars (god of war), who, along with Minerva, convinces Fame to trumpet the town's virtues.\nCybele (Magna Mater Goddess) pointing to the glory of Olympus, which could also be seen as a metaphor of Papal Power.\nBacchus, Pomona and Ceres, who symbolize the fertile lands of the surrounding countryside.The Farnese Hall, on the second floor, was rebuilt in 1665 by Cardinal Girolamo Farnese: it was previously known as \"Royal Hall\", since in 1530, Charles V was crowned King of Italy here with the Iron Crown (the imperial coronation took place, however, in the Basilica of San Petronio). The hall was frescoed with stories of the city from the Middle Ages to the 17th century, by pupils of Francesco Albani. The Chapel has frescoes (1562) by Prospero Fontana.\n\n\n== References ==\nPage on the palace (in Italian)",

        "wiki": "The Basilica of San Domenico is one of the major churches in Bologna, Italy. The remains of Saint Dominic, founder of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans), are buried inside the exquisite shrine Arca di San Domenico, made by Nicola Pisano and his workshop, Arnolfo di Cambio and with later additions by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca and the young Michelangelo.\n\n\n== History ==\nDominic Guzman, on arriving in Bologna in January 1218, was impressed by the vitality of the city and quickly recognized the importance of this university town to his evangelizing mission. A convent was established at the Mascarella church by the Blessed Reginald of Orleans. As this convent soon became too small for their increasing number, the preaching Brothers moved in 1219 to the small church of San Nicol\u00f2 of the Vineyards at the outskirts of Bologna. St. Dominic settled in this church and held here the first two General Chapters of the order (1220 and 1221). Saint Dominic died in this church on 6 August 1221. He was buried behind the altar of San Nicol\u00f2. \nBetween 1219 and 1243 the Dominicans bought all surrounding plots of land around the church. After the death of Saint Dominic, the church of San Nicol\u00f2 was expanded and a new monastic complex was built between 1228 and 1240. The apsidal area of the church was demolished and the nave was extended and grew into the Basilica of Saint-Dominic, This church became the prototype of many other Dominican churches throughout the world. \nThe big basilica was divided in two parts:\n\nthe front part, called \u201cinternal church\u201d, was the church of the brothers. It was built in a protogothic style with a nave, two aisles and ogival vaults.\nthe church for the faithful, called \u201cexternal church\u201d, with the simple columns and the  trussed flat roof of the old church.Both churches were divided by a ramp. The church was consecrated by Pope Innocent IV on 17 October 1251. On this occasion the crucifix by Giunta Pisano was shown for the first time to the faithful.\nThe remains of the saint were moved in 1233 from its place behind the altar to a simple marble sarcophagus, situated on the floor in the right aisle of the church for the faithful. Since most of the pilgrims, who came in great numbers to see the grave, were not able to see this shrine, hidden by so many people standing in front of it, the need was felt for a new shrine. In 1267 the remains of Saint Dominic were then moved from the simple sarcophagus into the  new shrine, decorated with the main episodes from the life of the Saint by Nicola Pisano. Work would continue on this shrine for almost five centuries.\nThe church was enlarged and the two sections were modified in many ways in the course of the next centuries. New side chapels were built, the majority in the 15th century. A Roman-Gothic bell tower was added in 1313 (recently restored). The dividing wall between the two churches was finally demolished in the beginning of the 17th century. The choir was at the same time moved behind the altar. Between 1728 and 1732  the interior of the church was completely renewed by the architect Carlo Francesco Dotti, sponsored by the Dominican pope Benedict XIII, into its present-day Baroque style.\nEarly on the church began receiving many works of art from the faithful. This has grown into the present-day vast collection of exceptional art treasures created by some the greatest Italian artists, including Giunta Pisano, Nicola Pisano, Arnolfo di Cambio, Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca, Michelangelo, Iacopo da Bologna, Guido Reni, Guercino and Filippino Lippi.\n\n\n== Square and fa\u00e7ade ==\n\nThe square in front of the church is paved with pebbles, as it was in medieval times. The square was used by the faithful to listen to the sermon from the preacher from the pulpit on the left corner of the church. It was also the original cemetery.\nThe column in the middle of the square is a brickwork column with the bronze statue of St Dominic (1627) and on the back of the square a column in marble, bricks and copper of the Madonna of the Rosary, after a design by Guido Reni (1632), commemorating the end of the plague in the city. \nBehind the first column stands the tomb of Rolandino de\u2019 Passeggeri by Giovanni (1305) and on the left, adjoining a house, the tomb of Egidio Foscarari (1289), enriched with an ancient Byzantine marble arch with relief works from the 9th century.\nThe Romanesque fa\u00e7ade dates from 1240 and was restored in 1910 by the architect Raffaele Faccioli. In the center is a large, embroidered rose window. The lunette above the portal contains a copy (1921) of St Dominic blessing Bologna by Lucia Casalini-Torelli (1677\u20131762).\nOn the left side of the fa\u00e7ade is the Lodovico Ghisilardi chapel in Renaissance style. It was built as an example of Vitruvian classicism by the architect Baldassarre Peruzzi around 1530.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\n\n=== Nave ===\nThe church consists of a central nave, two lateral aisles, several side chapels, a transept, a choir and an apse. The interior was completely renewed in Baroque style with refined elegance and well-balanced proportions by the architect Carlo Francesco Dotti (1678\u20131759). \nIn the lunettes above the Ionic columns along the nave we can see 10 paintings, depicting episodes (true and untrue) in the history of the church. The first two are by Giuseppe Pedretti (1696\u20131778), the others by Vittorio Bigari (1692\u20131776).\n\n\n=== Chapels on the right side ===\nSt. Rose of Lima : the painting above the altar, portraying the Ecstasy of the Saint, is by Cesare Gennari. The altar-piece Virgin appearing to St. Hyacinth by Ludovico Carracci (now in the Louvre), used to stand here.\nSt. Vincent Ferrer : the painting above the altar (St. Vincent brings a young boy back to life) is by Donato Creti (1731). On both sides of the chapel are two painting, representing the Miracles of the Saint, by Giuseppe Pedretti. The elegant stucco angels are by Angelo Pio (1690\u20131769), one of the best artists of his time.\nSt Antoninus of Florence : The painting above the altar (The Lord and the Blessed Virgin Appearing to St. Antoninus and St. Francis) is by Pietro Facini (1562\u20131602), while the paintings on the side walls (Blessed Matteo Carreri and Blessed Stefania) are by Pietro Dardani (1728\u20131808).\nSt. Andrew the Apostle : paintings of the Coming Martyrdom of the Apostle, Blessed Imelda and Blessed Giovanna are by Antonio Rossi (1700\u20131753)\nMadonna of Fevers: above the altar is the painting Sant\u2019Emidio by Filippo Gargalli (1750\u20131835). The painting Slaughter of the Innocents by Guido Reni, now in Bologna\u2019s Pinacoteca Nazionale, was once hung in this chapel.\nSt Dominic\u2019s chapel: this is the main chapel of the church. It has a square plan and a semi-circular apse, where the remains of the saint rest in the splendid Arca di San Domenico under the cupola which contains three Michelangelo sculptures, Angel, St. Proclus, and St. Petronius. The chapel was built by the Bolognese architect Floriano Ambrosini, replacing the old gothic chapel from 1413, to match the splendour of the other existing chapels. It was decorated between 1614 and 1616 by important painters of the Bolognese School, Tiarini (1577\u20131688), Mario Righetti, Lionello Spada, Mastelletta, culminating in the fresco on the cupola of the apse St Dominic\u2019s Glory, a masterpiece by Reni, painted between 1613 and 1615. The Theological and The Cardinal Virtues in the niches of the apse were painted by Giovanni Todeschi between 1617 and 1631. The bust in white marble by Carlo Pini (1946) represents the real face of Saint Dominic, modeled on the precise measurements performed on the saint\u2019s skull.\nChapel of St Pius V : the altar-piece is by Felice Torelli.\nChapel of St Hyacinth of Poland : with the painting A Miracle of the Saint by Antonio Muzzi.\nChapel of St Catherine of Siena: with St Catherine\u2019s Mystic Communion by Francesco Brizzi (1546\u20131625) above the altar.\nChapel of St Catherine Virgin and Martyr: the painting above the altar, Mystical Marriage of St Catherine, is an important panel and one of the last works by Filippino Lippi (1501\u20131503).\n\n\n=== Chapels on the left side ===\nChapel of St. Louis Bertrand : contains two canvases: (on the right) Blessed Pietro Geremia by Alessandro Tiarini and (on the left) St. Albert the Great by Clemente Bevilacqua (died 1754)\nChapel of the Holy Blood has some important paintings : (on the right) Annunciation by Denis Calvaert (1540\u20131619), (above the central altar) St. Michael Archangel by Giacomo Francia (1484\u20131557), (on the left) St Martin de Porres by Renzo Magnanini, (in the big lunette) The Disputation of St Catherine Virgin and Martyr by Prospero Fontana\nChapel of Blessed Benedict XI with the painting The Blessed is taken to Heaven by Felice Torelli (1667\u20131748)\nRosary Chapel is the most prominent chapel on this side of the church. The vivacious fresco on the vault (the Assumption) and in the apse (Heaven and Earth praising the Madonna of the Rosary) were painted between 1655 and 1657  by Angelo Michele Colonna (1600\u20131687) and by Agostino Mitelli (1609\u20131660). The two choir stalls were designed by the architect Carlo Francesco Dotti in 1736 after the redesigning of the interior of the church. The altar was designed by the Bolognese architect Floriano Ambrosini (1557\u20131621). But the most important paintings in this large chapel are the famous Mysteries of the Rosary, finished in 1601. The most prominent artist of their time worked on the decoration : Lodovico Carracci (the Annunciation and the Visitation), Bartolomeo Cesi (the Nativity), Denis Calvaert (Presentation of Jesus in the Temple), the female artist Lavinia Fontana (Jesus among the Doctors and the Coronation of the Virgin), Bartolomeo Cesi (Christ in the garden), Ludovico Carracci (the Scourging and Christ falling under the Cross), Bartolomeo Cesi (the Crowning with Thorns, the Crucifixion and Pentecost), Guido Reni (the Resurrection), Domenichino (the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin).Young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played on the organ in this chapel, while he was studying with padre Giovanni Battista Martini in 1769.\n\nVestibule of the side door contains the marble tomb of Alessandro Tartagni (1477) by Francesco di Simone Ferrucci da Fiesole (1437\u20131493).\nChapel of St Joseph : the canvas above the altar is Death of St. Joseph and St Anthony abbot by Giovanni Battista Bertusio (died 1644), and the paintings on the left (San Teresa di Ges\u00f9) and on the right (St Anthony of Padua) are by Giovanni Breviglieri.\nChapel of St. Peter the Martyr : the painting above the altar Kneeling Saint is by Giuseppe Pedretti, while the paintings on the left (Sant\u2019Agnese da Montepulciano) and on the right (St Catherine de Ricci) are by Pietro Dardani (1728\u20131808)\nChapel of St Raymond of Pe\u00f1afort contains the famous canvas the Saint plowing the Waves on his Mantle by Ludovico Carracci\nChapel of Blessed Ceslaus with the painting the Blessed by Lucia Casalini-Torrelli\n\n\n=== Right transept ===\nThere is a small chapel on the right side of the altar with a painting by the Baroque artist Bartolomeo Cesi and a canvas by Guercino St. Thomas Aquinas writing the Holy Sacrament (1662)\n\n\n=== Left transept ===\nChapel of the Holy Cross: On the wall is a marble slab, carved in 1731 by Giuseppe Maria Mazza, commemorating the death in 1272 of King Enzio of Sardinia, son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. He had been captured by the Bolognese Guelph forces in the Battle of Fossalta in 1249. The painting above the altar is Christ being laid down by Pier Francesco Cavazza (1667\u20131733), while on the right is the Assumption of the Madonna by Vincenzo Spisanelli (1595\u20131662).\nChapel of St Michael the Archangel : Here on view is the imposing Crucifixion, the masterpiece by Giunta Pisano (mid-13th century). It is still much influenced by the Byzantine style and represents one of the best examples of 13th-century Italian painting. This crucifix has much influenced Cimabue, who would then slowly evolve into his own style. On the right side we find the marble monument, spanning the two chapels, dedicated to the Bolognese ruler Taddeo Pepoli (died 1347) (who added in 1340 a barrel span to the northern transept of this church). This monument was begun in the 14th century and only finished in the 16th century. The fresco on the left wall St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Benedict dates from the 14th century.\nChapel of the Sacred heart: The papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 bust of Ven. Serafino Capponi, a theologian (died 1615) is on the left side of the altar. Beneath the altar is the urn with the relics of James Griesinger, the Blessed James from Ulm (died 1491), who added most of the stained-glass windows to this church (now destroyed). He is also depicted on canvas in this chapel by Giacinto Bellini (1612\u20131660). The fresco Madonna with Child among the Saints is by an unknown Emilian artist at the end of the 13th century. Facing King Enzo\u2019s monument is a fragment of a 14th-century fresco Face of St Thomas Aquinas\n\n\n== The choir ==\n\nThis monumental choir was moved behind the high altar in the 17th century. The original altar was a masterpiece decorated with basreliefs and nine sculptures by Giovanni di Balduccio (1330), a pupil of Giovanni Pisano. Now only the statue of St Peter the Martyr still exists and is on display in the City Museum.  The present high altar was made by Alfonso Torreggiani (died 1764).  In the middle of the golden altar-piece at the back of the apse, is the Adoration of the Magi by Bartolomeo Cesi, flanked by paintings (on its left side) of  Saint Nicholas of Bari  and (on its right side) of Saint Dominic.  Below is the Miracle of the Bread by Vincenzo Spisanelli.\nThe 102 wooden choir stalls are an exquisite example of Renaissance carving by the Dominican friar Damiano da Bergamo. (1528\u20131530).  Between 1541 and 1549 they were inlaid with intaglia by the same artist, using a series of drawings from a book by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, and carved by his brother Stefano da Bergamo.  The work was finished by brother Bernardino da Bologna.  These decorations display scenes from the Old Testament (on the right side) and from the New Testament (on the left side).  Because of its extraordinary artistic value, this remarkable marquetry work was considered by its contemporaries as the eight wonder of the world. It is also noted in the Vite (IV,94) by Giorgio Vasari\n\n\n== The museum ==\nThe church's small museum houses many important works of art and a wide collection of precious reliquaries, chalices and monstrances. \n\nA small selection : \n\nThe reliquary of Saint Louis IX, king of France, is of special interest as a most elaborate example in Gothic style of an unknown French goldsmith at the end of the 13th century.  It was a gift to this church by king Philip IV of France, following the canonization of Louis IX in 1297.\nThe remains of a  terracotta Piet\u00e0 (1495) by the architect, painter and sculptor Baccio da Montelupo (mentioned by Vasari in his Vite)\nA polychromed terracotta Bust of Saint Dominic by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca (1474)\nThe remains of a fresco of Madonna with Child and Saint Dominic by an unknown Bolognese artist (possibly Cristoforo da Bologna) (second half of the 14th century), this fresco is known among engineers and scientists for the detailed pattern of the water flow wake near the St Cristopher's heels that likely has inspired Theodore Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n in his studies\nMadonna of the Velvet, tempera on wood by Lippo Dalmasio (c. 1390)\nThe Paschal Lamb, an oil painting on wood sometimes ascribed to Giorgio Vasari\nMadonna with Child, Saint Dominic and Vincenzo Ferreri (c. 1773), one of the best works of  by Ubaldo Gandolfi (1728\u20131781)\nSeveral valuable intarsias by fra Damiano da Bergamo, such as The Story of San Girolomo, and geometrical figures.\n\n\n== Convent and library (Biblioteca di San Domenico) ==\nThe square-shaped convent next door is also worth visiting for its cloisters (14th, 15th and 16th centuries) with various tombstones and memorial tablets in its walls.  The chapter room displays a precious fresco of Saint Dominic from the 14th century. It is the oldest known image of the saint.  On the ground floor of the old dormitory is St Dominic\u2019s cell, so called because it is an original cell from his time and possibly the cell (or a similarly one) where he died.  Some original letters of introduction and his canonization bull of 9 July 1234 are here on display.  At the front of the library is a fresco Madonna with benedictory Child (by an unknown artist). \nThe three-aisled Renaissance library, the Biblioteca of San Domenico, planned like a basilica and built by Gaspare Nadi, dates back to 1469 and contains many precious books. Part of the library complex is now the seat of the faculty of philosophy and theology, run by the Dominicans. Another part is used as a conference room with a wooden-paneled coffer ceiling. At its end hangs the Baroque painting Ecstasy of St. Thomas Aquinas by Marcantonio Franceschini.\n\n\n== Other burials ==\nGuido Reni, in the Rosary Chapel\nElisabetta Sirani, also in the Rosary Chapel\nJames Of Ulm\nEnzio of Sardinia\n\n\n== References and sources ==\nReferences\nSourcesAlce, Venturino.

          "This church is very close to Hotel Touring. Looking at it you wouldn't think much of it until you get inside and have a guide who tells the story of the Church. The Tomb of Saint Dominic (Dominican founder) is located here. One of his relics is his skull entombed in a gold",
          "Basilica di San Domenico is centrally located and is a very beautiful and big basilica. There is an altar/sculptor of Michelangelo inside it.",
          "The beautiful frescoes and paintings in the cupula are incredible. There are some works on Michelangelo in the tomb of S. Domenico. Very central, its worthy to visit, you will not be disappointed.",
          "It always amazes me that a city the size of Bologna could have so many beautiful churches the size of San Domenico. But, it has. And, Basilica di San Dimenico should not be missed. The highlights include two side chapels that are more ornate than the main altar and the choir",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches. Most interesting is the Arca to Niccolo Pisano\u2019s tomb which was carved by Niccolo di Bari. There is a Filipino Lippi painting too.",
          "There are lots of churches in Bologna, and you can get overloaded with them. But this is special for the marquetry in the choir stalls behind the main altar. It is not obviously which way you go to see them, but preserve. It is well worth it. Once described as the 7th wonder",
          "The cathedral is huge and impressive structure, reflecting its history, and so are its surroundings. One of the paintings is of Filippino Lippi, the famous renaissance painter",
          "After doing a lot of walking, we spent a few minutes of reflection in this wonderful old church. The queues to get in (on a nice day) can long so pick your moments.",
          "Probably this is the nicest basilica of Bologna. Or at least according to me. You can see sculptures from Michelangelo here. Absolutely great.",
          "Of the 4 churches we visiting in Bologna, we thought this had the most beautiful interior. (Not that the others were any less impressive)",
          "This Basilica is little bit out the way of an ordinary tourist. It's famous for St. Dominic being buried here - the founder of the Dominican order. Famous artists worked on his grave led by Michelangelo. Entrance is free, but there's a small donation required for cloisters which",
          "As stated above You've seen one and after a while they all look the same. Well they do they all look the same",
          "We stumbled across this Basilica and went for a look. We were pleasantly surprised and stayed for a while just admiring everything. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "If going in one is surprised by the vast space, there isn\u2019t any decorative element calling the attention, until reaching the two lateral chapels. Mainly in the S. Domenico one becomes astonished with the richness of the Saint\u2019s tomb; be sure that you walk around it to observe",
          "When visiting Bologna, make sure you stop by this very impressive dominican church and take some time reading up on the history and the different works of art inside.",
          "Another of Bologna\u2019s imposing churches set in and overlooking its own square of Piazza San Domenico, internally it probably has more interesting features than some of the other churches in Bologna with the highlights being the marble ark containing the remains of the 13th",
          "A little away from the centre but worth a visit. It overlooks a cobbled square, from where the faithful used to listen to the sermon. San Domenico of Guzman founded the church around 1200 and his remains are in the main chapel. his arca is made of marble decorated with",
          "You have to pay to see this remarkable terra cota statue group, but it is definitely worth it. The expressions on the faces are extraordinary.",
          "Beautiful but very busy due to it being Easter. Well worth even a few minutes as a beautiful building.",
          "The highlight of this lovely church is a multi-layered altar piece, on which some of the carving (one amazing angel in party) was done by Leonardo da Vinci when he was only 19 years old. There are many other interesting features in the church, but this is the main reason for",

          "A warm and cozy church to visit! The colors, the paintings the sculptures, give the sense of warmth and relief. Situated very near to the center, its worth it to spend one hour to visit this place, full of art.",
          "As they say this is an amazing church, very richly decorated and very awe inspiring. The fresco's are delightfull and so intricate they give a full 3d effect long before anyone knew what 2,3,d effect were, Take your time in here and take it all in",
          "The church is a few blocks from the main historic center of town but well worth a visit - it has three early sculptures by Michelangelo.",
          "Basilica di San Domenico is \"a-must-see\" place in Bologna from many aspects. The architecture of the building is beautiful, reflecting a couple of styles like renaissance and medieval. When you go inside, the beauty goes on surprising you even more. The chapels are designed in",
          "It\u2019s a bit further out from the town centre, but definitely worth the walk. It\u2019s a really magnificent church, and a bit quieter than the nearby San Petronio which makes it a bit more enjoyable.",
          "The tomb of St Dominic is an elaborate composition by artists from different periods, The part by Nicola Pisano is stunning.",
          "The art treasures within the Basilica are extensive and splendid to see. We were fortunate also to receive a personal tour of S Dominic's cell and to see furniture he had regularly used and various of his personal belongings, and to be taken through a full history of the",
          "This is a must see in Bologna. Pay the l euro and go behind the altar and see the amazing choir stalls, inlaid with scenes, separated by stop fluted carved wood columns, all circling a central inlaid table on top of which is a huge holder for the music for the choir.",
          "Fantastic architecture but charged 2 euros to take photo, which to be fair probably doesn't meet the upkeep.",
          "This was a short walk outside the main tourist area- just before you get to the church, judging from the names of the shops we walked past, must be one of the wealthiest areas of the city. The church itself is enormous, two of the side chapels were particularly breathtaking.",

We also bought the \u20ac2 wrist band to allow to take photos and the \u20ac3 pp entrance to the Chapel of the Magi, This allowed us to take photos of the meridian unimpeded by rows of people trying",
          "Because this basilica is off the beaten track, it\u2019s makes for a more relaxing visit than other, more centrally-located churches. Reason to go (unless you\u2019re a devotee of St Dominic) are examples of work by Nicola Pisano and early Michaelangelo, Guido Renni, a beautiful suspended",
          "The Basilica is beautiful but more important is the historical importance. It tells a bit of the history of San Domenico and the Christian congregation the Domenicans, one of the first in Catholic history. If you are Catholic or religious you are likely to enjoy it.",
          "The church from outside give the impression of a humble church but once inside, one can admire the grandiose of Italian finest art. The remains of St. Dominic is in a marble shrine. There are smaller chapels inside for praying that is worth a visit to admire artwork in this",
          "This magnificent church is well worth visiting, not least for the 'Arca', a sarcophagus, which was worked on over three centuries by artistic giants including Michelangelo Buonarroti and Niccol\u00f2 di Antonio di Bari who, as a consequence of his amazing work on this monument,",
          "Walking past this basilica (en route to hotel) I was going to give it a miss. So glad I didn't! Stunning, and I saw the tomb unintentionally. My favourite church in Bologna",
          "Pisano's Crucifixion and the Ark of Saint Dominic (partially decorated by Michelangelo) should be enough of a reason to visit this church. Notice the square where it's located, with tombs from 1289 and 1305.",
          "We had the good fortune of walking in during choir practice. They towered over the altar and their voices carried everywhere. It\u2019s as if they were signing beside you. The remains of Saint Domini, founder of the Domenican order are on the left of the main altar. The remains",
          "An impressive basilica a short walk from the city centre, and in a pleasant area of the city. Interesting history and architecture make this worth a five minute walk from the central square.",
          "On the square are two tombes outside in their own mini building. Inside the Basilica are beautiful paintings of the young Michelangelo. And the alter has a lot of ornaments, very richly decorated. We were lucky to see the priests sing and pray.",
          "A big Dominican church. Here is buried the creator of the Order of St. Dominic. It was built in the 11th century.",
          "Located in a lovely, quiet area of this lovely town the badilica is an architectural gem, peaceful, tasteful, beautiful and loaded with religious and historical significance.",
          "The interior is bright and spacious and holds a lot of amazingly beautiful paintings and sculptures. I came in in the middle of a mass, so I could not enjoy all the works of art properly. Next time I'm in Bologna, I will definitely come to see the church again.",
          "It is in this church that the saint Dominicus, who started the Dominican order, is buried. There is a special chapel dedicated to his tomb, which is very well worth seeing. On the tomb itself, artists, including Michelangelo, worked for over 300 years. Other points of interest",
          "The church itself is large and grand. Much of it is very ornate. Stand out parts for me were the shoir stalls (costs 1 euro for choir and cloister) which are covered in fantastuc marquetry and the cloister which is an oasis of peace and calm.",
          "Somehow even though this is very central, it seems to be missed by many tourists. It is definitely worth a visit.",
          "An important place dedicated to the founder of the Dominican Order. San Dominica\u2019s tomb is quite impressive. The building itself is lacking compared to so many others. The interior was refurbished in a Baroque style in the 18th century.",
          "A very important Basilica in Bologna, beautiful sculptures and paintings are inside also the remains of St Dominic.",
          "This is one of the major churches in Bologna and the remains of Saint Dominic are buried inside a shrine behind the altar of St. Nicholas. The church is located in the Piazza San Domenico. The exterior is quite plain compared to similar Basilicas. There is a room full of relics",
          "We almost missed this most beautiful chapel but for a review we had read we would have - its through some gates up a couple of stairs & out of immediate view. The Basilica of San Domenico is one of the major churches in Bologna, Italy. The remains of Saint Dominic, founder of",
          "On a recent trip to Bologna, Italy my husband and I went to the Basilica of San Domenico. It is a lovely church and has three statues by Michelangelo who lived in Bologna for a time. The priest who was there was very friendly and showed us some of the art works. Just do not",
          "Having spend a couple of weeks in Italy, one can get a bit spoilt... oh well another amazing church with amazing painting etc. So it is nice to see one that has some differences- most of the church is quite plain, white and ordered (and has some Dominican monks around to add to",
          "This was our first sightseeing trip within a few minutes walking distance from our hotel. Don\u2019t be fooled by the unassuming brown-brick, fairly plain Romanesque fa\u00e7ade. The interior is a Renaissance masterpiece with three small sculptures by Michelangelo: Saint Petronius, Saint",
          "Stunning church, steeped in history. It has 3 early sculptures by the young Michelangelo . Mozart also practiced on one of the organs here when he was in Bologna preparing for an exam at the Philharmonic Academy. It is preserved to the right of the altar. Well worth a visit.",
          "Basilica di San Domenico is another of the lovely churches in central Bologna. Though not our favorite, the church is quite impressive inside and holds a beautiful shrine containing the remains of Saint Dominic, founder of the Dominicans. Young Mozart is said to have played",
          "Another pretty church in Bologna.Nice piazza.If you have time go there and have a look. Dress proper",
          "Huge Basilica, when we visited it, it was guarded by armed military units. Quiet busy, that\u2019s probably the reason why. Inside fascinating departments with old statues and paintings. Worth the visit.",
          "The church is beautiful inside and contains the remains of Saint Dominic in a shrine called the Arca di San Domenico. Many great artists including Michelangelo worked on the shrine which took 500 years to finish. It is stunning. The 13th century painted wooden crucifix by Giunta",
          "We visited this and found it to be very interesting , the museum inside is free but closed on a Monday it appears, you have to either wear clothes to cover your shoulders, or you can borrow a thin shawl whilst in the church, tip ... take your own !!",
          "Wonderfully ornate building. Lovely square outside to sit and enjoy cool breeze on hot day. Dont miss the tomb of san Tommasso.",
          "This church needs a guide. I came here without a guide and thought wow what a sexy church. I came here with a guide and thought I will die to protect our first born. Get someone who knows this place to show you around. If not, get to the back of the church and look at the",
          "A must see in Bologna. Part of the walking tour from the tourist office if you do it. Well worth a good look around. Lovely church.",
          "Lovely reflective space where the silence is palpable, easy to spend a few quite cool hours in the shade of the colonades",
          "This was our second trip to Bologna. We loved the Central city the first time we visited and vowed to come back. We spent our first visit, walking down the portico-covered sidewalks, gazing into shop windows and stopping for delicious meals and treats. Of course, we experienced",
          "Its a must see for anyone on a holiday that likes an old Italian Basilica. Great place to cool down and relax.",
          "We only stopped here since it was very near our hotel and entrance was free. There was some interesting artwork and I enjoyed the frescoes on the dome ceiling above the high altar. There St Domenico's ornate & impressive sarcophagus in a side chapel. I was glad we popped in",
          "The Tomb of St Dominic is the highlight - it is a must see. The Church is in a peaceful square away from the main bustle of the city. Worth seeing - and only a few minutes walk from the centre.",
          "Old and majestic, this church / basilica is renowned for having inside the tomb of Saint Dominic (the creator of the Dominicans order). Also his tomb is decorated with wonderful statues, out of which 4 were sculpted by Michelangelo.",
          "In a city \u2013 in a country \u2013 with many beautiful old churches, this one is up there in the first rank. Yet \u2026 perhaps because it\u2019s slightly away from the city centre, or perhaps it was the time of our visit, but there seemed to be very few visitors. Which is a pity. The interior is",
          "This church is ornate and has many wonderful artists' works there. If you find St Dominic's tomb, walk behind it and there are two figures carved at the top. The one on the right was done by a young Michelangelo.",
          "We saw this during the Saturday evening Mass - and what a sight! Full to bursting, brilliant choir, real sense of worship, and all in a magnificent building. Don't miss it.",
          "I was just walking around and decided to check it out. Beautiful and peaceful, a nice thing to experience. Check it out.",
          "The Church is very impressive and beautiful and we really liked The churchyard inside the church building!",
          "We went there on a sunny afternoon, at first it felt as if it was closed, but you can just walk through the front door. Once in, we where overwhelmed by the pure size of the church! It was surprisingly big and even more surprisingly there just 5 people in there. Don't forget",
          "Have visited lots of churches over the years -- this is beautiful. The highlight is clearly the Arc of St. Dominic, sculpted by numerous great artists (including a small contribution by Michelangelo). Don't forget to go around the tomb/alter, as you can see his reliquary on the",
          "Beautiful building, nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the main streets....only 5 minutes from Piazza Maggiore. Lovely atmosphere and paintings.",
          "It is in the hear of the old city of Bologna. The achirtecture of the inside of the church is simply amazing. One wonder how did they build huge pillars then?",
          "I passed by San Domenico on a quiet Friday afternoon, and the church was flooded with light and flowers (preparations for weekend services). A beautiful, airy church that offers a sense of calm and relatively few visitors.",
          "A very beautiful large church and with being able to use the builders lift for the superb view was even better.",
          "We have lived in Bologna on a number of occasions and always in the neighborhood of San Domenico where we would worship. On the first visit (in 1996) we discovered that there were 3 small Michelangelo's, including one that clearly (in our view) the forerunner of the David. If",
          "I have seen quite a number of Italian basilicas but this one stands out somehow. Definitely worth to see. Has a cloister as well. Visit it as well.",
          "This church is well worth a visit and is one of the most beautiful that I have been into anywhere. The altar of Saint Dominico is simply superb",
          "Before entering the church, pause to notice the distinctive raised tombs in the plaza. The one closest to the church\u2019s entrance has a pyramidal green tile roof. Another, smaller raised tomb with a red tile roof is beyond it. Outside, the church is simple, with a brick fa\u00e7ade.",
          "So when we entered this church I looked around and wondered what we were there to see. It looked like a fairly ordinary parish church in an ancient Italian city. The first paintings I could see were definitely second rate, or not that good. So what was there and why had we",
          "Founded in the 13th century, this is yet another astounding church. Brick-built, and still in wonderful condition. As ever, there is a lovely cloister. An interesting small museum, which opens at 10:00. It has its own noisy cat.",
          "We thought this was the best of the many churches we visited in Bologna. The basilica itself is beautiful and it's worth paying the small fee (I think it was 1 euro each) to visit the area behind the altar as well as the cloisters which are lovely.",
          "As it seems to me, the exterior of the Basilica is quite drab and almost forbidding. However, once again open the door one is transported into a special place. Whether Roman Catholic or not, it is impossible not to appreciate and admire the skills and craftsmanship invested in",
          "The treasures of San Domenico could easily be overlooked. Make sure you don't miss the chapel containing the sarcophagus of the saint - you can enter for a small donation. The stone carving is magnificent. Don't forget to walk to the back where the gold reliquary containing",
          "Fantastic -- also had the opportunity of visiting the 'treasure' of the cathedral. Splendid history and artwork.",
          "Compared against the Italian standard, one could call it rather austerely decorated. However, it does feature some impressive works, such as Michelangelo's , which should be, by themselves, a good enough reason to visit. He was only 20 something when he sculpted the Angel and",
          "this basilica is surprising when you go inside because it is not as ornate as some. But for us the \"must see\" is the sarcophagus with the incredible carving all around it. It is awe inspiring, and the later additions by Michelangelo are a bonus!",
          "We really fell across this passing looking for a cafe! Get your camera ready as some great sites inside, just so much to see - don't forget to cover up!",
          "Visited here because my partners name is Dominic and we felt obliged to see his church! We were unable to go inside due to a religious ceremony but never the less we were glad to visit. The exterior was radiant in the crisp winter sunshine and the column outside the church was",
          "We walked to this church, about six blocks from central Bologna. As others have said, where else do you see this number of Michelangelo works without any crowds to fight. For those who are interested in the Dominican religious order, this is also the site for St. Dominic's",
          "A beautiful church with a great feeling of calm. Hardly any tourists when we visited in the morning. We missed it last time we visited Bologna because it is a little away from the centre. Worth the detour.",
          "Where else can you see 3 Michelangelo sculptures together? And his first sculpture at 20 already a masterpiece. Church is lovely too. Ask the staff to show you which sculptures are his, you can tell by how much movement and refinement they have compared to the others.",
          "There are 3 sculptures by Michelangelo in Bologna's very beautiful San Domenico, a church filled with wonderful art and only a short walk from the Piazza Maggiore. The 20-year-old Michelangelo produced these 3 sculptures during a brief period when he was forced to leave",
          "As are many of the churches in Italy are, this Basilica is no exception. Beautiful architecture, art and design from the great masters of art present. The altar is beautiful and it is truely a place to see while in Bologna.",
          "Another very beautiful basilica worth seeing. Every church in Bologna is different. Always a pleasant surprise.,",
          "We chose to visit San Domenico after reading about the artworks housed there. The Basilica feels like a living church rather than a museum and the silence was well respected. The monument for San Domenico has 2 sculptures among the 12 created by a young Michelanglo. The choirs",
          "Great architecture and well maintained, no entrance fee but worth while giving a few euros to help maintain, definitely worth a visit",
          "we spent a long time here as there is so much to see. Not commercialised at all - just a lovely place",
          "This must be visited to be believed. I was overwhelmed by the majesty of the building and atmosphere. The sense of history, spiritual beauty and peace left me in a mood of quiet contemplation as did other centres of historic Christianity in this city.",
          "Basilica di San Domenico is one of the richest churches in terms of art and history.The remains of San Domenico , founder of the Order of Preaches are buried inside the shrine \"Arca di san Domenico\" made by Nicola Pisano. The church is located by Piazza San Domenico",
          "We were wandering around on a hot Sunday and came across this Basilica. Whilst not as large as the main basilica it is still large. The main central nave is not decorated to any great extent, however the 2 large side chapels are truly inspired and quite marvelous. Do go out of",
          "A beautiful church housing some of Michaelangelo's works from when he was a student. A lovely old man showed us around",
          "This church is a bit more removed from the city centre than other important churches. It's worth the stroll, though, south from the main area. You'll probably see the red-brick, not-that-attractive, bulk of the 13th-century church looming as you get closer. People come here",
          "Two extraordinary chapels richly decorated with gold, stunning frescoes and wooden carvings that are totally absorbing.",
          "Make sure you dress appropriately when visiting the cathedral as you should all the catholic churches. Some people were taking photographs which seemed inappropriate while people were praying. There are a lot of different chapels and windows to admire so take your time to look",
          "Incredibly beautiful church with fantastic interior. The outside doesn't look like much but once you get inside it's absolutely breathtaking.",
          "For half a euro you can enter the choir. If you know the Bible sort of well, it may be a lovely quiz to figure out the biblical scenes in the chorus stalls. We spent at least half an hour with this and really enjoyed ourselves.",
          "A rather quaint church, in a silent neighbourhood. The church is beautiful and has two very beautiful chapels inside. These two chapels are breathtaking with their sheer brilliance and beauty. We spent a lovely afternoon sitting on the benches right in front of church, looking",
          "We went to the Basilica di San Domenico on the advice of someone who found it by chance. There are other churches in Florence that more grand and ornate but they don't have the shrine of Saint Dominic, made by Pisano and including statues carved by a young Michelangelo and",
          "Stunning inside as we stumbled across the Basilica whilst wondering around Bologna. Just vast inside and we lit a candle for loved ones. peaceful and quiet in a busy town .",
          "We have a big love of church architect and this one was truly lovely especially as we arrived at the start of a small service which was beautiful to watch in this great building",
          "This is a working church and Mass was being held so we were limited to the outside which is veery interesting with the outside statues and crypts but could be so much better if there were some type of plaque with even a name or a date or really any type of information.",
          "Bizarre raised mausolea outside the church. Went here to see Michelangelo sculptures but a mass was taking place so half the church was closed off.",
          "from the outside, the Basilica di San Domenico would promise a great visit, but entering the church you will soon see that there is little of value to see. you'll survive your visit to Bologna without having been here.",
          "This church is the mother church of the Dominican order, where the founder of the order, Dominicus has been buried at the Capella di San Dominico with its beautiful marble Arce di San Dominico. The shrine of the founder is full of ornaments showing moments of his life. The",
          "We visited this church as a bit of an afterthought and were very pleased that we did. It is enormous inside as were most of the churches we visited and very beautiful. It is worth paying the extra 50 cents to go behind the altar and see the marvelous wooden choir stalls. The",
          "There is plenty to see in this large basilica which was completely rebuilt in the 17thC. It is free to see the beautiful shrine/tomb of St Dominic (who died here) on the RH (South) side by Pisano with elements by Michelangelo (and others). If you pay 3 Euros you can get into",
          "The outside is not so attractive, but if you enter it, you shall be amazed. As many churches in Bologna, it mixes art masterpieces from different ages, like gothic and baroque. A special attention must be paid at the San Domenico chapel, with amazing frescos.",
          "As with most of Bologna's centre, there's a treasure round every corner. We 'tripped over' this one by chance. It's very impressive, with art, sculptures, and above all, religious treasures with an important history. Go, even if you're not a Catholic!",
          "We thought the outside of this church was so unassuming that we were shocked when we entered to find such an enchanting Basilica. There are several chapels within the structure. It makes my \"don't miss\" list for Bologna!",
          "It's nice for a visit. Perhaps more for worshippers than tourists, which is quite something in a tourist city. My favourite bits are actually outside - two stone coffins (sarcophagi) in raised huts.",
          "We have visited many churces and basilicas, enjoyed specially Easter time with the celebrations and music as well. The basilica is impressive. And to bring a dog inside is allowed!",
          "In the heart of the city square, this is the main Cathedral for Bologna. It's quite stark inside, but the massive vaulted ceilings are worth seeing. It's under constant police guard, so you will be frisked as you go in and expect to have your bags and pockets searched. Inside,",
          "A major church in Bologna. It has the remains of the saint, fantastic artwork , including some early small work by Michelangelo, beautiful side chapels and the day we visited a group of 6 men where practising in the choir area. This was truly amazing because they were at the",
          "Impressive and grand ,well worth the ride to get there.We were struck by the scale of the Basilica and by it's beauty",
          "Very disappointed with this church. Though it was horrible inside actually, in typical 18th century baroque. Outside was nice and promising. It was so dark that we hardly saw anything, OK it was also a dark and rainy day. Only after looking at the guide book afterwards did we",
          "Although this basilica was completely rebuilt during the 18th century, giving it a neoclassical atmosphere that makes it hard to imagine the Dominican inspiration, it is still the resting place of St. Dominic, and for that reason is worth spending some time in, both for the",
          "If you're Catholic, don't miss seeing the beautiful tomb and reliquary of the founder of the Dominicans. Behind the sculpted marble sarcophagus is a reliquary with the saint's head.",
          "large church with many side altars,the tomb of St Dominic ,a bookstore and an adjacent cloister. Worth the short walk from the central square",
          "As most people do, I went here to see the statues that Michelangelo made while he was serving here. Plan your day with this place knowing that the church is closed between 1 pm and 3 pm. Although when we went, they happened to open up earlier than expected at 2:30 pm.",
          "One of the must see churches in Bologna in a great Italian city, not far from cathedral in centre. I think it has the tomb of St Dominic, please check in case I have this wrong. The church does feel special",
          "Although I have been living in Bologna since 1990, I have visited San Domenico's Church only last August 2015, as a tourist guide to my 24 year girl-nephew coming from Turin. Apart from the beauty of the Church, we were all impressed from the wonderful panorama we could enjoy",
          "At the southerr extremity of the city centre so slightly off the beaten track, but a place not to be missed. It houses the tomb of San Domenico, the founder of the Dominican movement who died in 1221. His tomb has gradually been added to during the centuries since, including",
          "Majestic and worth every minute there. It is absolutely beautiful inside and a treat to spend some time just taking in the beauty.",
          "I don't understand why this is rated so low - #15 in Bologna. The church is beautiful inside and holds the remains of St Domenic who is surely one of Catholicism's greatest saints, as well as works of Michelangelo. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "As the name suggests, this place is maybe the most important for the Dominicans. As the resting place of San Domenico this church has a special feel around. Very nicely decorated, calm and peaceful place to visit, short walk away from the main attractions.",
          "One of so many beautiful churches in Bologna, this one is particularly highly decorated. Well worth a visit. A peaceful place to just sit and contemplate.",
          "A splendidly impressive building - unusually light for its period. The tomb of St. Dominic with three sculptures by the young Michelangelo included amongst its forest of finely-worked sculpture is worth a look, The picture of the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine of Siena by",
          "A really wonderful church, full of exquisite art. A tranquil place to either take in the craftsmanship and devotion to religion.",
          "Just too much to take in, in such a short time, we allowed ourselves an hour but just not enough. One wishes that it would be acceptable to lay on the floor to better appreciate the vaulted ceilings.",
          "There are so many things to see. Besides the paintings, there are beautiful statues, an altar where Michelangelo sculpted 3 statues, a retrochoir with fabulous wood work, a very nice garden. It is one of the main churches of the city.",
          "There are a lot of treasure and hidden gems in this particular place. One will not appreciate what was inside by looking at the building from outside. a lot of stuff that i have never see before. some ancient architectural designs were everywhere on the building",
          "Hidden gem. Would never guess the treasures inside from its exterior. Make sure you see three small Michelangelo statutes on tomb of St. Domenic.",
          "One of cathedrals to visit for sure! As it is pretty often with Italian churches, it's not very attractive from outside, but when you come inside... you are just amazed and can't stop staring voiceless all these affresche, paintings, sculptures... Here you can also find the tomb",
          "Amazing Church rich in treasures. Don't miss it if you want to see somenthing off the beaten paths. It is located only 5 minutes from the main piazza.",
          "Amazing and beautiful Basilica. It is a wonderful experience and with church I see in Italy I am amazed and overwhelmed.",
          "When visiting Bologna it is a place where you have to go for sure. Beautiflul church. Just be aware you need to be dressed properly (no short shorts and boxer t-shirts",
          "One must visit this Basilica most especially the tomb of the saint.The cloister is very nice as well.",
          "There are places hidden away in Bologna that I didn't know about, but they are so rewarding when you turn a corner and see this incredible architecture.",
          "Massive church with very important works, including several by Michelangelo. The tomb of St Dominic, founder of the Dominican order, is here along with his reliquaries. Both because of its immensity and the interior design, it's a must see on any visit to Bologna.",
          "This cathedral was on my must see list because I have a affinity for relics, supposedly St. Dominic's relic was on display as well as a full figured wax replica of him. While it wasn't clear which chapel held these, the cathedral itself displays all the monetary might and power",
          "There are so many churches and cathedrals in a relatively short distance apart that its easy to many of them in the same day! My advise is don't unless you are only in Bologna for a day - but if you only come to Bologna for a day you will miss out on so much more. Nevertheless",
          "Enjoy walking through the street of expensive shops as you make your way to the basilica. Don't forget to look up at the ceilings of the building that you'll pass. Note that the basilica closes for lunch. According to the sign, the church and museum reopen at 15:30. However,",
          "THis was by far most interesting and spiritual church we visisted in Bologna. An amalgam of sevarl chruches from the past - lots of hostory and a v peaceful atmosphere. If you only visit one church, this is the one!",
          "Beautiful church with many sculptures and frescoes. There are 3 early sculptures by Michelangelo in the church, made while he was on the lam from Florence after the assasination of his patron, Lorenzo D'Medici..Well worth the visit",
          "There is a carved shrine to St Dominic which took 500 years to complete .Michelangelo had a hand in it.Unfortunately only one piece of information in English.",
          "Tremendous sculptures. Make sure they're lit up and take your time admiring them. There's a chart in the church labeling which artist was responsible for each section of the work.",
          "The basilica was very nice and important for Dominican Catholics. The chapels on the sides of the can be lit up for a small fee and some are well decorated. It is worth finding this church.",
          "This church was built in 1221 and is Italy's most important Dominican church. It was built to house the body of St Dominic who died here and whose magnificent tomb stands here. The tomb's statues were executed by Pisano and the angels and 2 saints are early works of",
          "Came accross this church while walking around generally. It was lovely but that night I researched it a bit and discovered that there was a lot to it - St Dominick is buried here, there are original Michael Angelo sculptures, an outdoor crypt halfway up a house outside it etc",
          "Basilica of San Domenico is one of the major historical churches in Bologna. After visiting so many churches, it is difficult not to compare. Around Bologna I found them on the dark side, a lot of them over decorated The name San Domenico, because it contains the remains of the",
          "Lovely peaceful place and so beautiful. Free entry and lovely to see the various different areas of the church.",
          "I never knew St. Dominic was laid rest here. A very important individual of the Catholic church. They made an alter for his remains. On the other side of the alter are two pews facing the rear of the alter. An encase sculpture made of gold has the remains of St. Dominic within",

          "Situated near the hotel in which I stayed, TOURING. Grand architecture and beauty. In the square there are seats which are useful when tired of trailing around.",
          "Make sure you don't go between 1200 and 1500 as they close for lunch. The church has some wonderful artwork, of which Filippino Lipppi's Mystic Marriage of St Catherine is my personal favourite",
          "Amazing what the inside of the basilica looks like - most look drab on the outside, but once you enter your jaw drops. Simply beautiful artisan workmanship",
          "Beautiful building, not over run by tourists. Unfortunately no photos are allowed and it is rigidly enforced. The exterior is rather un-impressive but you will be surprised when you enter. Very striking. You can sneak a few shots when the photo police aren't looking.",
          "The day we went it was almost empty, midweek late morning. The peace and tranquillity were welcome after the bustle of the main piazza. Free entry.",
          "I went to see the tomb and the Filippino Lippi and the G. Pisano crucifix - and they were wonderful. I didn't know about the extraordinary choir stalls: oxen straining under their loads, a rider struggling to control a shying horse, Abraham's hospitality, Moses receiving the",
          "Not sure why. It's not as big as the famous basilica at Piazza Maggiore, of course, and it has nothing to match the beauty of the Magi chapel there. But Basilica San Domenico just felt better, immediately. It looks as tho it has recently been beautifully restored. That may be",
          "Situated at the fringes of the shopping district of Bologna, I didn't find this at the top of the tourist must visit places. However, a local blogging website suggested this Basilica for some interesting paintings and sculptures one can look for. Such a peaceful and full of",
          "We went to half a dozen of the big churches in Bologna, this was our favorite. Would chose to go back here first, paintings, sculpture, the architectural space, the most wonderful marquetry in the old choir stalls - one could spend an hour with those alone; and the fragrant",
          "I have never seen anything like the inlaid wooden choir stalls in this church -- they are among the wonders of the world. Just be sure to check the opening times (e.g. the day I went, the church was open all day but I had to come back between 3-5 to see the choir).",
          "Not to close to the center of town but well worth spending the time to see. It contains the tomb of the famous Saint and a work of Michelangelo",
          "Great place to see some artwork. Some Michaelangelo's statuettes. We caught a Christmas concert by local children. Didn't like: couldn't take pictures",
          "There are a lot of churches to visit in Bologna and this was one of my favorites. It only costs a few coins to enter the shrine of St Dominic, which is very impressive even though it's difficult to figure out which of the many small statuettes adorning the tomb are",
          "Do try to visit this basilica to see St. Dominic's tomb as well as the choir, which is a masterpiece of intarsio. However, be forewarned that the basilica's opening hours are short, arbitrary and subject to the whims of Dominicans, who control the basilica. I have been to St.",
          "Visited on a very gloomy day but the attendant was very obliging and turned on the lights so that visitors could see the main highlight - the wonderful shrine of Saint Dominic",
          "Tricky to find but only a short walk from the Piazza Maggiore. Tomb of St Dominic decorated with little statuettes by Michelangelo. But the great find was a panel which was the last work of Lippi in the right hand chapel next to the altar. All free to visit",
          "Just average. Didn't climb to the top for the panoramic view, however. Lots of tours going through daily ( church is right next door to our hotel)",

          "Located in a pedestrian area the church has a wonderful woodden choir that is certanly worth a visit.",
          "Of the many church, basilicas etc. in Bologna, this was the pick for us. It had a good mixture of history, available literature (there are leaflets and a few scattered information boards throughout the nave) and art work. The overall structure was both imposing and impressive.",
          "Beautiful Basilica. We worth a visit if only to see Michelangelo's sculputure and the fabulous gold alter piece hidden away.",
          "This church, closed around lunch and up to mid-afternoon, check times, is not thrilling, but has some interesting side chapels and in one there are two small pieces of sculpture in an large altar-piece, by Michaelangelo aged nineteen. The church is set in a pleasant area where",
          "The Domenico Friars were in a foul mood the day I visited! If you weren't with a group you couldn't visit the area behind the alter and they didn't take well to any questions! This massive, heavily restored Basilica dates back to the 13th century but looks freshly painted and",
          "Bologna, like most Italian towns, is full of medieval and Baroque churchs and basilicas, but for me this stands out because it has the wonderful Filippo Lippi \"Mystical Marriage of St Catherine\". It you're not into medieval art, then this might not carry a lot of weight for you,",
          "Unlike San Petronio, the Basilica of San Domenico has excellent information panels about its history and the story of the Dominican Order, whose founder (San Domenico) lies in a beautiful tomb in a side chapel. The tomb is partly the work of Michelangelo, then just a young man",
          "Very nice church... not so easy to find the sculptures made by young Michel Angelo... they are half way through on the right hand side of the church.",
          "I went here to see sculptures by Michelangelo. The church felt special as there were not many tourists. There is so much history and architecture to explore in the church. If you can, have some guide book that helps you explore each portion of the church. That helps make",

          "While I can appreciate the balance needed between tourists and those seeking a religious experience, I seem to remember and enjoy places that allow photographs (maybe I need that interaction for memory's sake), so while I did think this church was interesting, I can't really",

          "huge church and the detail in the paintings and the sculptures and even the floor is amazing and the sundial in the roof.",
          "Very impressive to see what the catholic church did whit poor men's money. But of course they helped artists and provided labour opportunities. Makes you think...",
          "A beautiful rather understated Church - as is common in the Dominican tradition. Interesting catafalques outside the Curch itself/",
          "A very big church with many hidden treasures, the most important being the sculptures of Michelangelo on the tomb of San Domenico. Do visit it!",

          "We visited San Domenico during our visit to Bologna. This is an unusual church with dozens of huge white glass chandeliers hanging from the ceiling in the main body of the building. Take time to check out St. Dominic's side altar and tomb. Pretty awesome! Part of this tomb was",
          "It's a beautiful church. Not over the top. We stayed in there for more then an hour. Relaxing in the garden and admiring the sculping as well as the paintings.",
          "Definately the nicest church I saw in Bologna, but not much to see on the outside. Inside check out the chorus, each seat has different woodpanel images of inlaid wood. There must be at least 50 different seats. You can also find some of Michaelangelo's statues here.",
          "Very beautiful. No words will help you enough. Just go there and see it with your own eyes.",
          "The basilica houses the shrine of St.Dominic, which despite his immense importance was surprisingly empty when we visited. The actual tomb-chest, the \"arca\", is what gave the sculptor Niccolo dell'Arca his name, and is a quite extraordinary feat of programmatic renaissance",
          "The tomb of St Dominic is located in a side chapel of this magnificent church, reputed to be haunted by Michaelangelo, who carved an angel for the altar, and Mozart, who played the organ here as part of his tuition. The altar of St Dominic is worth the visit alone, richly",
          "This is set in a large piazza and we found it the most interesting church in Bologna. The tomb of St Dominic is absolutely amazing and has to be seen to be believed but this is only one of many tombs and altars etc to view.",
          "Beautiful interior for taking pictures and enjoying the history of the Basilica. Some of the Basilicas & churchs don't allow flash or the taking of pictures. This one allowed both. They try to move you along and not let you stay very long, even when there are not that many",
          "We visited San Domenico on a Sunday morning and there was a lively atmosphere as modern-day pilgrims wandered around. The church is of late Gothic origin, originally built in the 1200s to house the tomb of St Dominic, and was remodelled in 1728-32 in Baroque style by Carlo",
          "Unique and interesting church, attracting many visitors who come to see St Dominic's burial place. The Shrine is wonderful and unforgettable. Small Entry Fee to walk around it. There are also several impressive works of art, incl. the very early works of Michelangelo. One can",
          "is a great church, a classical italian one,do not miss it.",
          "You need to pay 50c to get into the shrine, but it's worth every cent to see the fine sculpture, including 3 figures by Michaelangelo, and also the large and detailed reliquary, which is round the back. They seem to keep the lights turned off when it's not busy, so seek out one",
          "Located just in the centre of Bologna, close to shops, restaurants, trattorias and a lot of other things to see, like the Santo Stefano neighborhood. It is a late Middle Ages church, with a large square in front, where you can sit (but not in summer! there are no trees, so no",
          "Beautiful hidden treasure which had no other visitors.",
          "And just think young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played on the organ in this chapel, while he was studying with padre Giovanni Battista Martini in 1769. This is not to be missed",

        "wiki": "Bologna (, UK also , Italian: [bo\u02c8lo\u0272\u0272a] (listen); Emilian (Bolognese dialect): Bul\u00e5ggna [bu\u02c8l\u028c\u0272\u02d0a]; Latin: Bononia) is the capital and largest city of the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy with about 390,000 inhabitants and 150 different nationalities. Its metropolitan area is home to more than 1,000,000 people.Originally Etruscan, the city has been one of the most important urban centres for centuries, first under the Etruscans (Felsina), then under the Celts as Bona, later under the Romans (Bononia), then again in the Middle Ages, as a free municipality and signoria, when it was among the largest European cities by population. Famous for its towers, churches and lengthy porticoes, Bologna has a well-preserved historical centre, thanks to a careful restoration and conservation policy which began at the end of the 1970s. Home to the oldest university in the world, the University of Bologna, established in AD 1088, the city has a large student population that gives it a cosmopolitan character.  In 2000 it was declared European capital of culture and in 2006, a UNESCO \"City of Music\" and became part of the Creative Cities Network.Bologna is an important agricultural, industrial, financial and transport hub, where many large mechanical, electronic and food companies have their headquarters as well as one of the largest permanent trade fairs in Europe. According to the most recent data gathered by the European Regional Economic Growth Index (E-REGI) of 2009, Bologna is the first Italian city and the 47th European city in terms of its economic growth rate. As a consequence, Bologna is also one of the wealthiest cities in Italy, often ranking as one of the top cities in terms of quality of life in the country: in 2011 it ranked 1st out of 107 Italian cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity and Middle Ages ===\n\nTraces of human habitation in the area of Bologna go back to the 3rd millennium BCE, with significant settlements from about the 9th century BCE (Villanova culture). \nThe influence of Etruscan civilization reached the area in the 7th to 6th centuries, and the Etruscan city of Felsina was founded at the site of Bologna by the end of the 6th century.\nBy the 4th century BCE, the site was occupied by the Gaulish Boii, and it became a Roman colony and municipium with the name of Bononia in 196 BCE. \nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, Bologna, then a frontier outpost of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna, was repeatedly sacked by the Goths; it is in this period that legendary Bishop Petronius, according to ancient chronicles, rebuilt the ruined town and founded the basilica of Saint Stephen. Petronius is still revered as patron saint of Bologna.\nIn 727\u201328, the city was sacked and captured by the Lombards under King Liutprand, becoming part of that kingdom. These Germanic conquerors built an important new quarter, called \"addizione longobarda\" (Italian meaning \"Longobard addition\") near the complex of St. Stephen. In the last quarter of the 8th century, Charlemagne, at the request of Pope Adrian I, invaded the Lombard Kingdom, causing its eventual demise. Occupied by Frankish troops in 774 on behalf of the papacy, Bologna remained under imperial authority and prospered as a frontier mark of the Carolingian empire.After the death of Matilda of Tuscany in 1115, Bologna obtained substantial concessions from Emperor Henry V. However, when Frederick Barbarossa subsequently attempted to strike down the deal, Bologna joined the Lombard League, which then defeated the imperial armies at the Battle of Legnano and established an effective autonomy at the Peace of Constance in 1183. Subsequently, the town began to expand rapidly and became one of the main commercial trade centres of northern Italy thanks to a system of canals that allowed barges and ships to come and go. Believed to have been established in 1088, the University of Bologna is widely considered the world's oldest university in continuous operation. The university originated as a centre for the study of medieval Roman law under major glossators, including Irnerius. It numbered Dante, Boccaccio and Petrarch among its students. The medical school was especially renowned. By 1200, Bologna was a thriving commercial and artisanal centre of about 10,000 people.During a campaign to support the imperial cities of Modena and Cremona against Bologna, Frederick II's son, King Enzo of Sardinia, was defeated and captured on 26 May 1249 at the Battle of Fossalta. Though the emperor demanded his release, Enzo was thenceforth kept a knightly prisoner in Bologna, in a palace that came to be named Palazzo Re Enzo after him. Every attempt to escape or to rescue him failed, and he died after more than 22 years in captivity. After the death of his half-brothers Conrad IV in 1254, Frederick of Antioch in 1256 and Manfred in 1266, as well as the execution his nephew Conradin in 1268, he was the last of the Hohenstaufen heirs.\nDuring the late 1200s, Bologna was affected by political instability when the most prominent families incessantly fought for the control of the town. The free commune was severely weakened by decades of infighting, allowing the Pope to impose the rule of his envoy Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget in 1327. Du Pouget was eventually ousted by a popular rebellion and Bologna became a signoria under Taddeo Pepoli in 1334. By the arrival of the Black Death in 1348, Bologna had 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants, reduced to just 20,000 to 25,000 after the plague.In 1350, Bologna was conquered by Archbishop Giovanni Visconti, the new lord of Milan. However, following a rebellion by the town's governor, a renegade member of the Visconti family, Bologna was recuperated to the papacy in 1363 by Cardinal Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz after a long negotiation involving a huge indemnity paid to Bernab\u00f2 Visconti, Giovanni's heir, who died in 1354. In 1376, Bologna again revolted against Papal rule and joined Florence in the unsuccessful War of the Eight Saints. However, extreme infighting inside the Holy See after the Western Schism prevented the papacy from restoring its domination over Bologna, so it remained relatively independent for some decades as an oligarchic republic. In 1401, Giovanni I Bentivoglio took power in a coup with the support of Milan, but the Milanese, having turned his back on them and allied with Florence, marched on Bologna and had Giovanni killed the following year. In 1442, Hannibal I Bentivoglio, Giovanni's nephew, recovered Bologna from the Milanese, only to be assassinated in a conspiracy plotted by Pope Eugene IV three years later. But the signoria of the Bentivoglio family was then firmly established, and the power passed to his cousin Sante Bentivoglio, who ruled until 1462, followed by Giovanni II. Giovanni II managed to resist the expansionist designs of Cesare Borgia for some time, but on 7 October 1506, Pope Julius II issued a bull deposing and excommunicating Bentivoglio and placing the city under interdict. When the papal troops, along with a contingent sent by Louis XII of France, marched against Bologna, Bentivoglio and his family fled. Julius II entered the city triumphantly on 10 November.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\nThe period of Papal rule over Bologna (1506\u20131796) has been generally evaluated by historians as one of severe decline. \nHowever, this was not evident in the 1500s, which were marked by some major developments in Bologna. In 1530, Emperor Charles V was crowned in Bologna, the last of the Holy Roman Emperors to be crowned by the pope.\nIn 1564, the Piazza del Nettuno and the Palazzo dei Banchi were built, along with the Archiginnasio, the main building of the university. The period of Papal rule saw also the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the restoration of older ones. At this time, Bologna had ninety-six convents, more than any other Italian city. Painters working in Bologna during this period established the Bolognese School which includes Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Guercino and others of European fame.\n\nIt was only towards the end of the 16th century that severe signs of decline began to manifest. A series of plagues in the late 16th to early 17th century reduced the population of the city from some 72,000 in the mid-16th century to about 47,000 by 1630.  During the Italian Plague of 1629\u201331 alone Bologna lost up to a third of its population. In the mid-17th century, population stabilized at roughly 60,000, slowly increasing to some 70,000 by the mid-18th century. The economy of Bologna started to show signs of severe decline as the global centres of trade shifted towards the Atlantic. The traditional silk industry was in a critical state. The university was losing students, who once came from all over Europe, because of the illiberal attitudes of the Church towards culture (especially after the trial of Galileo). Bologna continued to suffer a progressive deindustrialisation also in the 18th century.In the mid-1700s pope Benedict XIV, a Bolognese, tried to reverse the decline of the city with a series of reforms intended to stimulate the economy and promote the arts. However, these reforms achieved only mixed results. The pope's efforts to stimulate the decaying textile industry had little success, while he was more successful in reforming the tax system, liberalising trade and relaxing the oppressive system of censorship.The economic and demographic decline of Bologna became even more noticeable starting from the second half of the 18th century. In 1790 the city had 72,000 inhabitants, ranking as the second largest in the Papal States; however this figure had remained unchanged for decades. The economy was stagnant because of Papal policies that distorted trade with heavy custom duties and sold concessions of monopolies to single manufacturers thus lowering competition, depressing productivity and incentivising corruption.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nNapoleon entered Bologna on 19 June 1796. Napoleon briefly reinstated the ancient mode of government, giving power to the Senate, which however had to swear fealty to the short lived Cispadane Republic, created as a client state of the French Empire at the congress of Reggio (27 December 1796 \u2013 9 January 1797) but succeeded by the Cisalpine Republic on 9 July 1797, later by the Italian Republic and finally the Kingdom of Italy. \nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 restored Bologna to the Papal States. \nPapal rule was contested in the uprisings of 1831. The insurrected provinces planned to unite as the Province Italiane Unite with Bologna as capital. Pope Gregory XVI asked for \nAustrian help against the rebels. Metternich warned French king Louis Philippe I against intervention in Italian affairs, and in the spring of 1831, Austrian forces marched across the Italian peninsula, defeating the rebellion by 26 April.By the mid 1840s, unemployment levels were very high and traditional industries continued to languish or disappear; Bologna became a city of economic disparity with the top 10 percent of the population living off rent, another 20 percent exercising professions or commerce and 70 percent working in low-paid, often insecure manual jobs. The Papal census of 1841 reported 10,000 permanent beggars and another 30,000 (out of a total population of 70,000) who lived in poverty. \nIn the revolutions of 1848 the Austrian garrisons which controlled the city on behalf of the Pope were temporarily expelled, but eventually came back and crushed the revolutionaries.\nPapal rule finally ended in the aftermath of Second War of Italian Independence, when the French and Pidemontese troops expelled the Austrians from Italian lands, on 11 and 12 March 1860, Bologna voted to join the new Kingdom of Italy.\nIn the last decades of the 19th century, Bologna once again thrived economically and socially. In 1863 Naples was linked to Rome by railway, and the following year Bologna to Florence. Bolognese moderate agrarian elites, that supported liberal insurgencies against the papacy and were admirers of the British political system and of free trade, envisioned a unified national state that would open a bigger market for the massive agricultural production of the Emilian plains. Indeed, Bologna gave Italy one of its first prime ministers, Marco Minghetti.\nAfter World War I, Bologna was heavily involved in the Biennio Rosso socialist uprisings. As a consequence, the traditionally moderate elites of the city turned their back on the progressive faction and gave their support to the rising Fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. Dino Grandi, a high-ranking Fascist party official and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, remembered for being an Anglophile, was from Bologna. During the interwar years, Bologna developed into an important manufacturing centre for food processing, agricultural machinery and metalworking. The Fascist regime poured in massive investments, for example with the setting up of a giant tobacco manufacturing plant in 1937.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nBologna suffered extensive damage during World War II. The strategic importance of the city as an industrial and railway hub connecting northern and central Italy made it a target for the Allied forces. On 24 July 1943, a massive aerial bombardment destroyed a significant part of the historic city centre and killed about 200 people. The main railway station and adjoining areas were severely hit, and 44% of the buildings in the centre were listed as having been destroyed or severely damaged. The city was heavily bombed again on 25 September. The raids, which this time were not confined to the city centre, left 2,481 people dead and 2,000 injured. By the end of the war, 43% of all buildings in Bologna had been destroyed or damaged.After the armistice of 1943, the city became a key centre of the Italian resistance movement. On 7 November 1944, a pitched battle around Porta Lame, waged by partisans of the 7th Brigade of the Gruppi d'Azione Patriottica against Fascist and Nazi occupation forces, did not succeed in triggering a general uprising, despite being one of the largest resistance-led urban conflicts in the European theatre. Resistance forces entered Bologna on the morning of 21 April 1945. By this time, the Germans had already largely left the city in the face of the Allied advance, spearheaded by Polish forces advancing from the east during the Battle of Bologna which had been fought since 9 April. First to arrive in the centre was the 87th Infantry Regiment of the Friuli Combat Group under general Arturo Scattini, who entered the centre from Porta Maggiore to the south. Since the soldiers were dressed in British outfits, they were initially thought to be part of the allied forces; when the local inhabitants heard the soldiers were speaking Italian, they poured out onto the streets to celebrate.\n\n\n==== Cold war period ====\n\nIn the post-war years, Bologna became a thriving industrial centre as well as a political stronghold of the Italian Communist Party. Between 1945 and 1999, the city was helmed by an uninterrupted succession of mayors from the PCI and its successors, the Democratic Party of the Left and Democrats of the Left, the first of whom was Giuseppe Dozza. At the end of the 1960s the city authorities, worried by massive gentrification and suburbanisation, asked Japanese starchitect Kenzo Tange to sketch a master plan for a new town north of Bologna; however, the project that came out in 1970 was evaluated as too ambitious and expensive. Eventually the city council, in spite of vetoing Tange's master plan, decided to keep his project for a new exhibition centre and business district. At the end of 1978 the construction of a tower block and several diverse buildings and structures started. In 1985 the headquarters of the regional government of Emilia-Romagna moved in the new district.In 1977 Bologna was the scene of rioting linked to the Movement of 1977, a spontaneous political movement of the time. The police shooting of a far-left activist, Francesco Lorusso, sparked two days of street clashes.  On 2 August 1980, at the height of the \"years of lead\", a terrorist bomb was set off in the central railway station of Bologna killing 85 people and wounding 200, an event which is known in Italy as the Bologna massacre. In 1995, members of the neo-fascist group Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari were convicted for carrying out the attack, while Licio Gelli\u2014Grand Master of the underground Freemason lodge Propaganda Due (P2)\u2014was convicted for hampering the investigation, together with three agents of the secret military intelligence service SISMI (including Francesco Pazienza and Pietro Musumeci). Commemorations take place in Bologna on 2 August each year, culminating in a concert in the main square.\n\n\n==== Recent history ====\nIn 1999 the long tradition of left-wing mayors was interrupted by the victory of independent centre-right candidate Giorgio Guazzaloca. However, Bologna reverted to form in 2004 when Sergio Cofferati, a former trade union leader, unseated Guazzaloca. The next centre-left mayor, Flavio Delbono, elected in June 2009, resigned in January 2010 after being involved in a corruption scandal. After a 15-month period in which the city was administered under Anna Maria Cancellieri (as a state-appointed prefect), Virginio Merola was elected as mayor, leading a left-wing coalition comprising the Democratic Party, Left Ecology Freedom and Italy of Values.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Territory ===\n\nBologna is situated on the edge of the Po Plain at the foot of the Apennine Mountains, at the meeting of the Reno and Savena river valleys. As Bologna's two main watercourses flow directly to the sea, the town lies outside of the drainage basin of the River Po. The Province of Bologna stretches from the western edge of the Po Plain on the border with Ferrara to the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. The centre of the town is 54 metres (177 ft) above sea level (while elevation within the municipality ranges from 29 metres (95 ft) in the suburb of Corticella to 300 metres (980 ft) in Sabbiuno and the Colle della Guardia). The Province of Bologna stretches from the Po Plain into the Apennines; the highest point in the province is the peak of Corno alle Scale (in Lizzano in Belvedere) at 1,945 metres (6,381 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBologna has a mid-latitude, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa).\nAnnual precipitation oscillates between around 450 mm (18 in) and 900 mm (35 in), with the majority generally falling in spring and autumn. The last major snow event was in November 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (Consiglio Comunale), which is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a corrected proportional system (granting the majority to the list or alliance of lists which receives more votes), contextually to the mayoral elections.  The executive body is the City Committee (Giunta Comunale), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Bologna is Virginio Merola (PD), elected on 16 May 2011 with the 50.5% of the votes. On 19 June 2016 Merola was re-elected in a second-round ballot with 54.64% of votes.The municipality of Bologna is subdivided into six administrative Boroughs (Quartieri), down from the former nine before the 2015 administrative reform. Each Borough is governed by a Council (Consiglio) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organization is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities.\n\n\n=== Provincial and regional government ===\n\nBologna is the capital of the eponymous metropolitan city and of Emilia-Romagna, one of the twenty regions of Italy. While the Province of Bologna has a population of 1,007,644, making it the twelfth most populated province of Italy, Emilia-Romagna ranks as the sixth most populated region of Italy, with about 4.5 million inhabitants, more than 7% of the national total. The seat of the regional government is Fiera District, a tower complex designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange in 1985.\nAccording to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Bologna is one of the 15 Metropolitan municipalities (citt\u00e0 metropolitane), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Bologna is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor (Sindaco metropolitano), presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 18 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality.\nThe Metropolitan City of Bologna is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and by the Metropolitan Council (Consiglio metropolitano). Since 21 June 2016 Virginio Merola, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nUntil the late 19th century, when a large-scale urban renewal project was undertaken, Bologna was one of the few remaining large walled cities in Europe; to this day and despite having suffered considerable bombing damage in 1944, Bologna's 142 hectares (350 acres) historic centre is Europe's second largest, containing an immense wealth of important medieval, renaissance, and baroque artistic monuments.\nBologna developed along the Via Emilia as an Etruscan and later Roman colony; the Via Emilia still runs straight through the city under the changing names of Strada Maggiore, Rizzoli, Ugo Bassi, and San Felice. Due to its Roman heritage, the central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement. The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. No more than twenty medieval defensive towers remain out of up to 180 that were built in the 12th and 13th centuries before the arrival of unified civic government. The most famous of the towers of Bologna are the central \"Due Torri\" (Asinelli and Garisenda), whose iconic leaning forms provide a popular symbol of the town.The cityscape is further enriched by its elegant and extensive porticoes, for which the city is famous. In total, there are some 38 kilometres (24 miles) of porticoes in the city's historical centre (over 45 km (28 mi) in the city proper), which make it possible to walk for long distances sheltered from the elements.\nThe Portico di San Luca is possibly the world's longest. It connects Porta Saragozza (one of the twelve gates of the ancient walls built in the Middle Ages, which circled a 7.5 km (4.7 mi) part of the city) with the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca, a church begun in 1723 on the site of an 11th-century edifice which had already been enlarged in the 14th century, prominently located on a hill (289 metres (948 feet)) overlooking the town, which is one of Bologna's main landmarks. The windy 666 vault arcades, almost four kilometres (3,796 m or 12,454 ft) long, effectively links San Luca, as the church is commonly called, to the city centre. Its porticos provide shelter for the traditional procession which every year since 1433 has carried a Byzantine icon of the Madonna with Child attributed to Luke the Evangelist down to the Bologna Cathedral during the Feast of the Ascension.San Petronio Basilica, built between 1388 and 1479 (but still unfinished), is the tenth-largest church in the world by volume, 132 metres long and 66 metres wide, while the vault reaches 45 metres inside and 51 metres in the facade. With its volume of 258,000 m3, it is the largest (Gothic or otherwise) church built of bricks of the world. The Basilica of Saint Stephen and its sanctuary are among the oldest structures in Bologna, having been built starting from the 8th century, according to the tradition on the site of an ancient temple dedicated to Egyptian goddess Isis. The Basilica of Saint Dominic is an example of Romanic architecture from the 13th century, enriched by the monumental tombs of great Bolognese glossators Rolandino de'Passeggeri and Egidio Foscherari. Basilicas of St Francis, Santa Maria dei Servi and San Giacomo Maggiore are other magnificent examples of 14th-century architecture, the latter also featuring Renaissance artworks such as the Bentivoglio Altarpiece by Lorenzo Costa. Finally, the Church of San Michele in Bosco is a 15th-century religious complex located on a hill not far from the city's historical cente.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn terms of total GDP, the Metropolitan City of Bologna generated a value of about \u20ac35 billion ($40.6 billion) in 2017, equivalent to \u20ac34,251 ($40,165) per capita, the third highest figure among Italian provinces (after Milan and Bolzano/Bozen).The economy of Bologna is characterized by a flourishing industrial sector, traditionally centered on the transformation of agricultural and zootechnical products (Granarolo, Segafredo Zanetti, Conserve Italia), machinery (Coesia, IMA), energy (Hera Group), automotive (Ducati, Lamborghini), footwear, textile, engineering, chemical, printing and publishing (il Mulino, Monrif Group, Zanichelli).\nIn particular, Bologna is considered the centre of the so-called \"packaging valley\", an area well known for its high concentration of firms specialised in the manufacturing of automatic packaging machines. Furthermore, Bologna is well known for its dense network of cooperatives, a feature that dates back to the social struggles of farmers and workers in the 1800s and that today produces up to a third of its GDP and occupies 265 thousand people in the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBologna is home to the Guglielmo Marconi International Airport, the seventh busiest Italian airport for passenger traffic (8 million passengers handled in 2017).\nBologna Centrale railway station is one of Italy's most important train hubs thanks to the city's strategic location as a crossroad between north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes. It serves 58 million passengers annually. The city hosts several minor railway stations (see List of railway stations in Bologna).\nIn addition, Bologna San Donato classification yard, with 33 railway tracks, is the largest freight hub in Italy by size and traffic.The city is also served by a large network of public bus lines, including trolleybus lines, operated since 2012 by Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna (TPER).\nA large commuter rail service is currently under development (see Bologna metropolitan railway service), and a four line tram network is also planned (see Trams in Bologna).\n\n\n=== Bologna public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bologna, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 53 min. 9% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 16% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.4 km, while 7% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2016, the city proper had a population of 388,254 (while 1 million live in the greater Bologna area), located in the province of Bologna, Emilia Romagna, of whom 46.7% were male and 53.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 12.86 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 27.02 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bologna resident is 51 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bologna grew by 0.0 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bologna is 8.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nAs of 2009, 89.47% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Romanians and Albanians): 2.82%, East Asia (mostly Filipino): 1.50%, and South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh): 1.39%.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Bologna, conventionally said to have been founded in 1088 by glossators Irnerius and Pepo, is the oldest university in Europe. It was an important centre of European intellectual life during the Middle Ages, attracting scholars from Italy and throughout Europe. The Studium, as it was originally known, began as a loosely organized teaching system with each master collecting fees from students on an individual basis. The location of the early University was thus spread throughout the city, with various colleges being founded to support students of a specific nationality.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era, the headquarters of the university were moved to their present location on Via Zamboni, in the north-eastern sector of the city centre. Today, the University's 11 schools, 33 departments, and 93 libraries are spread across the city and include four subsidiary campuses in nearby Cesena, Forl\u00ec, Ravenna, and Rimini. Noteworthy students present at the university in centuries past included Dante, Petrarch, Thomas Becket, Pope Nicholas V, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Copernicus. Laura Bassi, appointed in 1732, became the first woman to officially teach at a university in Europe. In more recent history, Luigi Galvani, the discoverer of bioelectromagnetics, and Guglielmo Marconi, the pioneer of radio technology, also worked at the University. The University of Bologna remains one of the most respected and dynamic post-secondary educational institutions in Italy. To this day, Bologna is still very much a university town, with over 80,000 enrolled students in 2015. This community includes a great number of Erasmus, Socrates, and overseas students. The university's botanical garden, the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, was established in 1568; it is the fourth oldest in Europe.\nJohns Hopkins University maintains its Bologna Center in the city, which hosts one of the overseas campuses of the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). SAIS Bologna was founded in 1955 as the first campus of a US post-graduate school to open in Europe. It was inspired by Marshall Plan efforts to build a cultural bridge between America and Europe. Today, the Bologna Center also hosts the Associazione italo-americana \"Luciano Finelli\", which supports cross-cultural awareness and exchange between Italy and the United States.In addition, Bologna hosts a music school, Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini, established in 1804, and an art school, Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna, founded in 1802. Both institutions were born as part of the reforms introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOver the centuries, Bologna has acquired many nicknames: \"the fat\" (la grassa) refers to its cuisine, in which the most famous specialities are prepared using rich meats (especially pork), egg pasta and dairy products, such as butter and Parmesan. Another nickname that has been given to the city is \"the red\" (la rossa), which was originally \nused as a reference to the colour of the buildings in the city centre, has later become connected with the communist ideology supported by the majority of the population, in particular after World War II: until the election of a centre-right mayor in 1999, the city was renowned as a bastion of the Italian Communist Party. The centre-left regained power again in the 2004 mayoral elections, with the election of Sergio Cofferati. It was one of the first European cities to experiment with the concept of free public transport.\nBologna has also two other nicknames: the first one, \"the towered\" (la turrita) refers to the high number of medieval towers that can be found in the city, even if today only 24 towers are still standing. The second one, \"the learned\" (la dotta) is a reference to its university.\n\n\n=== University ===\nBologna university was founded in 1088 and it is considered the oldest university of the Western world. According to the QS University Rankings, Bologna university is the 4th Italian university and the 180th in the world.\nThe high number of students coming from all over Italy and the world (in Bologna there are several campuses of foreign universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Dickinson College, Indiana University, Brown University, University of California and more) considerably affects the everyday life: if on one hand it contributes to liven up the city centre (an area in which the average age of the residents is very high), and it also helps to promote cultural initiatives, on the other hand it creates public order and garbage problems which are related to the lively nightlife of the university district.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe city of Bologna became a UNESCO City of Music on 26 May 2006. According to UNESCO, \"As the first Italian city to be appointed to the Network, Bologna has demonstrated a rich musical tradition that is continuing to evolve as a vibrant factor of contemporary life and creation. It has also shown a strong commitment to promoting music as an important vehicle for inclusion in the fight against racism and in an effort to encourage economic and social development. Fostering a wide range of genres from classical to electronic, jazz, folk and opera, Bologna offers its citizens a musical vitality that deeply infiltrates the city's professional, academic, social and cultural facets.\"The theatre was a popular form of entertainment in Bologna until the 16th century. The first public theater was the Teatro alla Scala, active since 1547 in Palazzo del Podest\u00e0. An important figure of Italian Bolognese theatre was Alfredo Testoni, the playwright, author of The Cardinal Lambertini, which has had great theatrical success since 1905, repeated on screen by the Bolognese actor Gino Cervi. In 1998, the City of Bologna initiated the project \"Bologna dei Teatri\" (Bologna of the Theatres), an association of the major theatrical facilities in the city. This is a circuit of theatres which offer diverse theatrical opportunities, ranging from Bolognese dialect to contemporary dance, but with a communications strategy and promoting unity. Specifically, the shows on the bill in various theatres participating in the project are advertised weekly through a single poster. Bologna's opera house is the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The Orchestra Mozart, whose music director was Claudio Abbado until his death in 2014, was created in 2004.\nBologna hosts a number of international music, art, dance and film festivals, including Angelica Bologna and Contemporanea (festivals on contemporary music), Bolognafestival (international classical music festival),\nBologna Jazz Festival, Biografilm Festival (a film festival devote to biographic movies), BilBolBul (a comics festival), Danza Urbana (a street contemporary dance festival) F.I.S.Co(festival on contemporary art, now merged in Live Arts Week) Future Film Festival (animation and special effects),Il Cinema Ritrovato(film festival about rare and forgotten movies), Live Arts Week, Gender Bender (festival on gender identity, sexual orientation and body representation), Homework festival (electronic music festival), Human Rights Film Festival, Some Prefer Cake (lesbian film festival), Zecchino d'Oro (a children's song contest).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has baptised the famous Bolognese sauce, a meat-based pasta sauce that in Italy is called rag\u00f9 and is substantially different from the variety found worldwide; moreover, in Bologna the sauce is used only as a dressing for tagliatelle, serving it with spaghetti being considered odd. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured pork meats such as prosciutto, mortadella and salumi is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include Pignoletto dei Colli Bolognesi, Lambrusco di Modena and Sangiovese di Romagna. Tagliatelle with rag\u00f9, lasagne, tortellini served in broth, and mortadella, the original Bologna sausage, are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti (\"cookies of the dead\"), multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for All Saints' Day, jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on Saint Joseph's Day, and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar, certosino or panspeziale (\"carthusian\" o \"apothecary-cake\"), a spicy cake served on Christmas. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year, as the zuppa inglese.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nA sporting nickname for Bologna is Basket City in reference to the successes of the town's two rival historic basketball clubs, Virtus and Fortitudo, though the clubs are now often referred to by the names of their current sponsors.\nOf the two, the former won 15 Italian basketball championships and two Euroleagues making them one of the most influential European basketball clubs; the latter won two league titles between 1999 and 2005.\nThe rivalry is temporarily dormant since Fortitudo left the country's professional ranks when, following the 2008\u201309 season, the club was relegated from the top-level Lega A to LegADue, before being relegated further to the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti for financial reasons; in the 2012\u201313 season, Fortitudo will play in the LegADue.\nThe Italian Basketball League, which operates both Lega A and LegADue, has its headquarters in Bologna.\nFootball also has a strong tradition in Bologna. \nThe city's main club, Bologna F.C. 1909, have won seven Italian league championships (the latest in 1963\u201364), which make them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league; in their heyday in the 1930s Bologna FC were called \"Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa\" (Italian for \"The Team that Shakes the World\").\nThe club play at the 38,000-capacity Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, which has hosted the Italian national team in both football and rugby union, as well as the San Marino national football team.\nIt was also a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nRugby union is also present in the city: Rugby Bologna 1928 is not only one of the oldest Italian rugby union clubs but also the first ever club affiliated to the Italian rugby union federation. and, to date (2014) is Italy's oldest rugby union club still in operation.\nThe club took part to the top tier of the Italian championship for the first 25 years of their history never winning the title but getting to the runner-up place several times; they returned in top division (Serie A1 then Super 10), in the late 1990s and faced serious financial problems which led them to the relegation and almost to disappearance.Gianni Falchi Stadium is a baseball stadium located in Bologna. It is home to the home games of Fortitudo Baseball Bologna, in the Italian Baseball League.\n\n\n== People ==\n\nUlisse Aldrovandi (naturalist, 1522\u20131605)\nAntonio Alessandrini (anatomist and

          "One of the most intresting places in Bologna. You really get the vibe of the building. Read few info before visiting. Really amazing!",
          "The University of Bologna was founded in 1088. Erasmus and Copernicus were students. Albert Einstein gave a series of lectures on relativity here. That alone was enough to make me want to see it. The uni wasn\u2019t always in this Palace. Originally it was scattered in different",

          "We went to visit the anatomical theatre which was fascinating but were also blown away by the library. The building itself is incredibly beautiful with wonderful corridors and ceilings. The history of the university is amazing.",
          "This was once the main building of the Bologna University but today it houses the Archiginnasio Municipal Library, the Anatomical Theatre and the Stabat Mater Hall. The building is truly impressive. Outside is a courtyard surrounded by a line of loggias and two stairways lead",

          "For the price of \u20ac3 admission, this is a fine bulding and is fascinating to explore; i recomend it for sure",

          "We went here on our last morning in Bologna--thank god I didn't skip it! Every ceiling, wall, and floor was gorgeous. I wish I'd had a little longer--I would plan 1-1.5 hours, but I was in a rush as we had to catch a train. Make sure you walk all around the rooms you can go",

          "This was my 4th time in Bologna and the very first time I've visited this oldest European University, according to which a master degree bears its name. I would probably skip it even this time, but my son enrolled the Economic faculty this year, as well as his friend who was",
          "Although overlooked by many tourists, when in Bologna, visiting the Archiginnasio is a must, having been the seat of the oldest university in Europe until 1803. The building itself is a masterpiece, with walls beautifully decorated with the coats of arms of selected students",
          "The seat of the original, and very ancient University of Bologna is a mandatory stop when visiting Bologna. It is well worth paying the \u20ac3 ticket to access the Teatro Anatomico and Stabat Mater. I found it really fun to look at the crests with the names of the former students",

          "The present building dates from 1565 and was built to accommodate one of Europe\u2019s oldest universities. The visit comprises a tour of the courtyard which displays the coats of arms of its most famous (or wealthy) graduates. These are being gradually restored. The most interesting",

          "Fascinating decorated walls and stairways. Fantastic wood carving. Amazing that it once hosted students.",
          "The building is fascinating - now a library rather than a university or law and science. A look back in history, and the development of higher education. Its frescoed walls and early dissection room are well worth a look.",
          "We briefly went to the old university\u2019s (oldest in Europe) anatomy theater (neat but a reconstruction as it was bombed in WW2) and took a peak at the library. You cannot go in the library but there is a barred door that lets you peek at the repeating rows of bookcases that go on",

          "Very interesting to see the family crests and tributes to professors and graduates that cover most of the walls. The anatomy theater is very interesting and there are information sheets in multiple languages including English that help you to understand the history of the place.",
          "The building is beautiful and it\u2019s fun looking at the names of old students and trying to see where they came from. However you can explore the building for free. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth paying the entrance price just to see the theater of anatomy, which was nice but nothing",
          "It is worth visiting the oldest university in the world. The structure is by beautiful and there are some very interesting items on display.",
          "One of the reasons we decided to visit Bologna was to visit the library. Imagine our horror when we were told the public cannot enter. Can't really add to that.",
          "This former medical school is well worth a visit. It\u2019s a beautiful building and cost a mere 3 euros each to see around. The size of the library is breathtaking and the theatre where they carried out the pathology classes is stunning. It\u2019s set close to the Maggiore plaza so worth",

          "The wood carvings and history of this place will astound you but it\u2019s the real sense of community among the students with their families coat of arms decorated everywhere that leaves with you. Just have a seat and imagine the place full of students - including Thomas Beckett.",
          "This is a sensory overload. Of the many buildings of this age we have visited none has as many coats of arms, plaques and other memorial as the Archiginnasio has. The great shame is that so much of it is a reconstruction following war damage which has robbed it of the patina of",
          "The University of Bologna dates back to 1088AD. This building (not quite as old) has a long history and is incredibly ornate and well decorated. Well worth a visit if you find yourself in the heart of Bologna.",

          "This is probably one of the most important buildings in Bologna; the Archiginnasio was once the main building of the University of Bologna and now houses the famous Anatomical Theatre. It is so hard to grasp that this room is created completely in wood \u2013 it is a small room with",
          "When I suggested to my wife that we should visit a library she said \"Why?\" When we saw the long room full of books used by the University staff and students, \"Why?\" turned to \"Wow!\" Although visitors cannot go into the library (University students are easily distracted!) there",

          "Interesting building. I sort of didn't like to pay 3 euros to see the Theatre, but I can live with that. The rest is a huge collection of symbols.",
          "We found this to be a gem. Similar to the museum of Bologna it is exceptionally well maintained, the staff spoke English and were generous to put up with our halting Italian. The surgeons lecture room is very well presented and has information sheets to read whilst sitting. It",
          "Well worth the 3 Euros to see the anatomical theatre and Library. Also wander around the cloisters to get a feel for the history of the building.....right next to the Basilica and much more interesting",
          "Although there were already several teaching locations for different professors in Bologna, this was purpose build to centralise all the teaching, with 16 class rooms, and ceremonial activities. It thus houses also the later renamed Stabat Mater room. The building is decorated",
          "I would highly recommend a visit to this little anatomy theatre, which will give you some idea of life as an 19th century medical student. Aside from that, the woodwork is amazing, a real work of art in itself.",

          "Fabulous place to visit. Rich in history, art and architecture. The anatomy room is a must to see. The wood carvings are of high quality. Also close your eyes and imagine that you follow the first human anatomy class 3 centuries ago.. The libary is another must do! Sid down",
          "It was a thrill to see the 500 year old building. The anatomic theater saw many important medical discoveries. The library is not to be missed.",

          "This is a really good building to see and very interesting. Originally it was to house the lecture halls of the university .It is now also a civic library. The main front has an arcade with 30 arches very beautiful indeed. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We found this by accident and was so amazed at how bueatiful it was. We spent over 2 hours just looking at all the bueatiful scenary. I will definitely be visiting this place again. Take a good camera with you. You wont regret it. We didnt go on a guided tour since we found this",
          "The Teatro Anatomica and Sala Mater rooms are unbelievable. For 3\u20ac I got to see them both and gaze upon the extensive collection of Scientific manuscripts and journals that are centuries old. The paintings, frescoes and building itself are incredible. From top to bottom it is",

          "A must see if you're visiting Bologna. It only costs 3 Euros. The story of this classroom is an amazing glimpse into the history of medical education and Bologna. There were very few other visitors when we were there. We sat for awhile taking in the beauty of the woodwork. I",

          "This room is really imposing. It has many of the old text books of the early university. There is a long view from the theatre of the rows and rows of books shelves. This room is cordoned off.",
          "For \u20ac3 you get to visit the quadrangle of the oldest university in the world - quite something on its own. Couple that with an ancient lecture theatre with some oddly disturbing anatomically correct carvings, a separate lecture hall and a glimpse of the galleries in the library",
          "Beautiful hall, enchanting carvings and sculpures. Must go for everyone interested in history of the city.",
          "A very old surgical theatre once used to educate medicine students. Contains interesting sculptures.",
          "Not the easiest place to find but absolutely worth a visit. We had heard about the theatre & finally found it. Although a lot has been replaced after it was damaged in the war, this is still an incredible piece of history & the carvings are amazing. Follow it up with a visit to",
          "If you have any interest at all in science or medicine how can you resist being in such a historic place? Just imagining what it must have been like back then we so cool. Admission is cheap so definitely stop by!",
          "If walls could speak, you may not want to listen! Remarkable reconstruction (original elements incorporated) after War damage of the Anatomical dissection Room.",
          "For a disabled traveller, entry is not straight forward, but possible. The disabled entrance is at the side in Via de Foscherari. The staff are very helpful. The theatre itself is fascinating, and should be coupled with a trip to the Palazzo Poggi Museum to see the anatomical",
          "we happened to look through a doorway and saw such beautiful paintings that we went in. The building is beautiful and well worth a visit.",
          "I went here a week ago (I had been in the building in Feb. 2014 but for whatever reason did not actually go into this room). A key thing to realize is due to an Allied bombing in WWII, this room and much of the building was destroyed and was more or less rebuilt from scratch.",
          "It was one of the highlights of my stay in Bologna - while it's not the first anatomical theatre (for this one - go to Padua), it utilizes a different, more modern design. It was great to see both (Padua, Bologna) and understand how acceptance for public dissections evolved.",
          "Teatro Anatomico is a classroom where anatomy was taught. It's very interesting because of its historical value, its detailed wooden anatomical sculptures and its importance in terms of university studies of the time. You have to give 3 euro though to enter and to me it was not",
          "Reading about the Anatomical Theater was intriguing but seeing the actual theater was anticlimactic. I didn\u2019t have a preconceived notion about what it would look like but I left thinking that had we NOT gone, we would have wondered what we\u2019d missed. In actuality I wasn\u2019t",
          "This is an old medical teaching school. The old surgical teat re is impressive. The library very interesting and massive. It looks small but look through the metal gates at the stage end of the lecture theatre.",
          "For a city that I had limited knowledge of it certainly has a wealth of attractions. This particular little diamond is a stunning piece of scientific history and although small,is definitely worth seeing,as is the ornately decorated library and the building in which they are",
          "Worth a stop in if you're in Bologna and appreciate its history as a university town. An impressive room in a cool historic building loaded with history. Doesn't require much time to visit, but definitely worth it.",
          "Yes, it is the classroom of most modern technology at that time. I imagine the fruits of deep and comprehensive research came to Japan in 19th century.",
          "This was a very interesting place to visit whilst in Bologna and even if you are not interested in history, well worth a visit. Suggest going when the weather is cooler, as there is no air conditioning and it was uncomfortable during our visit.",
          "I had heard of this place, and came across it by accident while walking near Piazza Maggiore. I had seen it on a tv programme and wanted to visit it. It is a beautiful room, in a lovely old building which was the first site of the university. It's hard to imagine what it must",
          "This was probably my favorite part of my trip to Bologna. I was amazed to see the level of detail in the wood carvings in this all-wood classroom. It was also cool just to see how a college lecture hall was set up several hundred years ago, at the world\u2019s oldest university.",
          "For \u20ac3 it's tempting to rush your visit here as it feel a little disappointing due to being one room. If you don't take your time to stop, read the information card, and enjoy the space you will likely feel short changed. Remember to use your ticket to visit the library as well",
          "A small hall and not much to see actually. It is paid, I thinl 3 euro. Just tick it off the list. Funny.",
          "This is a rebuilt theatre after extensive war time damage. Very well done. The statues are mostly original and the atmosphere seems authentic. Useful to read about the theatre before visiting as I feel you get more from the visit that way. Free entry for people who are disabled",
          "It wasn\u2019t what we expected. Just a tiny room, with a marble table in the middle. Saw the old library as well, but not a must see.",
          "So amazing to see this early lecture theatre where anatomy was taught and the church monitored the teaching to make sure it was acceptable. The whole University establishment that surrounds it is full of history and significance. Well worth the visit",
          "The anatomy theatre of the University a wooden lecture theatre with carved statues on walls and ceiling. It was almost destroyed by a bomb but has been expertly restored. The marble slab in the centre for the body with two places for the best students to cut open a body whist",

          "Teatrico Anatomico is an interesting site where anatomy was taught centuries ago. Tickets cost 3 Euros per adult with children free. You can visit the lecture theatre, with a marble operating table in the middle, and parts of the university library. It is quite interesting but,",
          "Well one of the historical rooms...but unique with that marble operating table. Cant imagine how looked the lectures 800 years ago.... An open wax model would give a dramatic appearance....",
          "An excellent opportunity to visit the first university of Europe and walk into the anatomy class. A room full of history. With the same ticket you can view another room containing old books which is also amazing.",
          "We visited this anatomical lecture theatre today. The building is interesting with lots of carving and history. The entry fee as has been commented before, is three euros just to see one room and peer into a library. I would not mind this and it is certainly worth a visit,",
          "The University of Bologna is the oldest continually operating university in the world. The anatomy theatre is also famous as being one of the oldest and the reason the university has one of the best medical school in Italy. The interior corridor to the actual anatomy room is",

          "Once used for anatomical lectures this is a very impressive and ornate wooden theatre. It was destroyed in WW2 but painstakingly rebuilt using all the original pieces salvaged from the rubble.",
          "The anatomical theatre forms part of the original university and is all original other than for the marble slab. Really interesting to have a look round and get a bit of a sense of history - the live dissections were not just for students but also open to the public and",
          "Part of the first university in the world. In this room the training of medieval doctors was carried out. The hall is also very interesting because of its rich wood carving.",
          "The anatomical theatre is interesting and was where public body dissections occurred. Cedar wood tiered seats surround a marble topped dissection table. A little macabre the lecturer's chair is supported either side with wood carvings of skinned figures. However down the hall",
          "We paid 3 euros each for two adults and no charge for our kids (aged 11 and 12). We arrived as a tour was being given in Italian, which we don't understand very well. For the price, it is fine, you also get access to a room of the library surrounded by old books divided by",
          "We were there at the same time as a tour party so had the benefit of their guide explaining the history which was very interesting. Worth a visit as a beuatiul place.",
          "Inside the wooden room one can find brochures describing the history of the place. It is quite a good reading. The room itself is not big and some of the interior decorations are not original, as the whole building suffered a lot during the war, so do not expect anything",
          "One would not expect a highly decorated and wood panelled room to be an anatomical theatre, but so it is. There is still the table and seats for students, as well as the special stand for the professors, when not teaching directly from the table. The room is quite small,",
          "Even though the theatre itself is just one room and you have to rely on a printed factsheet, it is really impressive and the wooden sculptures are amazing.",
          "We were amazed how ornate the inside of the theatre was, particularly the ceiling. Worth stopping off to see.",
          "Beautifull wallpaintings, oustandig library, good atmosphere! And off course: the medieval college room: impressive.",
          "While the whole thing is interesting, they charge a rather steep price for the limited access you're granted.",

          "It's the first building of the university of Bologna. The building is small, so you can visit in 30 min even if you wish. the entry is only 3 EUR. But inside, it's really quite inspiring - you can really imagine how the first lectures took place etc. Just a warning, if you are",
          "For only 3 euros you can visit one of the first organized medical schools. There is more to see than just the anatomy theatre. My favorite was actually the wall of crests that are sort of like diplomas for the graduating students. The year and origins (even as far as Peru!)",
          "Fabulous place to visit. Rich in history, art and architecture. The anatomy room is a must to see. The wood carvings are of high quality. Also close your eyes and imagine that you follow the first human anatomy class 3 centuries ago.. The libary is another must do! Sid down",

          "Having studied anatomy for four years, I found this place amazing. Make sure you get the information about it before you go in to get as much out of your visit here as possible. Well worth a look!",
          "It is an interesting sight to see in Bologna. Both being the first death hospital, and the interior design is so nice.",
          "Interesting place concerning the history of medice and the Bologna university. You see the room and the table where autopsies were done in the past, to give students the opportunity to see the inside of the human body. For the same price you can also the library, which is very",

          "The theatre was built in 1637 to allow medical students to learn by observing dissections of human corpses. It is housed in the Palazzo dell\u2019 Archiginnasio (previously the main building of the university in the city). Stunning cedar wood 'amphitheatre' where students could",
          "Interesting and quite bizarre - earliest anatomy school and teaching for students from human cadavers",

          "The hall is quite understated, but when you get further information about it you begin to understand the history. Well worth reading up before a visit to get the full value.",
          "We were in for just a few minutes, but the building and the atmosfere there was overwelming. Would be great to be able to see more of the university. Ore to spend more time reading about it.",
          "The Bibiloteca that houses the Teatro Anatomico is truly a magnificent gem in the city centre, it's just a few steps away from Piazza Maggiore the main square and is almost hidden between the buildings, the Teatro itself is just a one room but it is worth the 3 euro entrance fee",

          "Located on the first floor of the Palazzo dell'Archiginnasio, this magnificent panelled room is where some of the first dissections in Europe were carried out. You might think that this would be a macabre place to visit but apart from the canopy above the professors' chair,",

          "Arrived here as pt of walking tour from tourist office - well wrth a visit, beautiful carvings and interesting history",
          "Established in 1080, the University of Bologna was the oldest in Europe. The operating theatre was started in that period, where inquisitive minds were exploring how the human body was all about. That in itself is fascinating! Although much of the building was destroyed by",
          "Once in Piazza Maggiore, do not miss to pay a visit to the Archiginnasio, the first stable location of the University of Bologna, established by Carlo Borromeo. Ticket cost only EUR 3 and the visit can take ~ 5-10 minutes. Impressive the frescos of the corridors that lead you to",
          "When you enter in this sight you feel to go back centuries.Such a shame that the original one was bombed in January 1944.It has been rebuilt in a such amazing way wirh the attention to all the details.THe theatre is located inside the Archiginnasio complex ancient headquarter of",
          "My year of Med School was one of the last years privileged to learn anatomy by cadaveric dissection. It was humbling to stand in front of the stone slab (you aren't allowed up into the seats) and imagine the hundreds of years of previous anatomy students, learning by",
          "If we hadn't taken the walking tour we might have missed this seeing very interesting room. Tour guide gave us information on how the students performed autopsies and how they had to provide their own bodies to work on.",
          "Teatro Anatomico is in the Biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio. It was built in 1637 so that medical students could learn by observing dissections of human corpses. The entrance is only 3 Euros and has a magnificent courtyard.",
          "The oldest medical school. Please venture here. Bologna is wonderful for these exiting gems. Take the time and sit to marvel in the original classroom where the earliest doctors were taught.",
          "This building and the anatomical room is a must see. However, we paid to enter as we saw it wasn't included in the Bologna Welcome Card. The following day we bought the Card and this was included The lesson, get your Welcome Card and go on the included walk/tour.",
          "Loved it, definitely recommend to see whether you are student of anatomy or not. Cost is 3 euros and they have laminated sheets with information in many languages.",
          "To be hones, I went there because my husband was rather keen on it, but my....I have not regretted it a minute. The place itself is full of history and significance for the progress of modern medicine. Also, the room is richly decorated with wood inlays and sculptures of famous",
          "I'm glad we had a chance to visit the Teatro Anatomico. It may not be as \"impressive\" as many other sites in the area, but the history is fascinating and it's wonderful standing in a place with such a history. i do recommend a visit if you're in the area.",
          "Teatro Anatomico is inside the Archiginnasio Palace. It was built in 1637 so that medical students could learn by observing dissections of human corpses. There are statues of Hippocrates and Galen. The courtyard area is also of note; it is decorated, amongst other things, with",
          "We visited here with the Bologna Welcome walking tour and were able to hear a lot about the history through our guide. The anatomical theatre itself is certainly unusual with it's wooden layout but equally absorbing.",
          "with 3 euros [ ticket price ] you can buy a cannoli....Just a room made of wood...nothing special..sorry",
          "Well worth a look, but don't expect to see much. Not as interesting as the blurb makes out. It has been very well restored however.",
          "Teatro Anatomico is in the Biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio. Visiting it means to enter a beautiful place, larger and more imposing than it would be expected, where one is transported to the scene where students of medicine used to see the practical works that prepared them to the",
          "The wood carvings that were recreated after this area was bombed in WWII are stunning, and the history of the suite and the university in general are interesting and worth visiting.",
          "This was a fairly short stop for us. The building is elaborately decorated and loaded with academic interest. Apart from the information about the theatre itself, there wasn't much translated into English so we weren't able to get a lot out of the other exhibits and displays.",
          "This building near piazza maggiore is very beautiful with a lot to see.The anatomy room is very impressive and the corridors had a really nice decor.A must see.",
          "This is a rare sight and is one of the treasures of Bologna of which there are many. It gives an insight into the science and work carried out by the ancient university. set in a lovely building around a coutyard .The lovely decoration of the theatre belies what was done here in",
          "Teatro Anatomico is situated in the Palazzo dell'Archiginassio in the historic center of Bologna. It is about 2 minutes walk from Piazza Maggiore, just beside Basilica di San Petronio. I really enjoyed the unique architecture of the building, including the impressive courtyard",
          "When you visit the place without any previous info, it is just an old room with wooden walls. But if you read the info papers, and with a little bit of luck, catch a tourist group there, you'll see the history in front of your eyes. This is the very first room for anatomy",
          "This place is a must see on any trip to this amazing city.It was quite quiet when I visited it. The ceilings and friezes are so wonderfully painted and I even watched a female restorer at work!Don't miss this one!",
          "I saw this place on Italy Unpacked on the BBC and immediately needed to go. It's easy to find, close to Piazza Maggiore and only \u20ac3 to enter. The courtyard below is stunning, with every wall and all the ceilings filled with plaques and paintings. The Anatomy Theatre is",
          "Considering the original building was devastated during the war the restoration is very impressive. It is easy to imagine the students of the day watching an autopsy on the centr.al podium. Just off Piazza Maggiore it is easy to find.",
          "Having read about the anatomical theatre and seen a tv programme about it, we were not disappointed. it is a 'must see' for visitors to Bologna",
          "It's worth having a quick look round this fine building, the walls of which are studded with student coats-of-arm. Inside is the Teatro Anatomica (entrance fee: 3 euros) once used for dissections. Handsome pale wood plus some sculptures (including skeletally-thin male nude).",
          "Visited as part of a city walking tour. The guide gave a history of the building which was most interesting. The wood carvings were spectacular too.",
          "The intricate wood paneling and statuary take you back centuries but the general design of the room reminded us somewhat of a lecture theaters we had encountered (admittedly quite a few years ago). It was easy to imagine seeing the body on the slab and the students peering down.",
          "Well worth a visit Well worth the visit even if I put down my Bologna book on a seat & then left without it. 10 mins later it had disappeared.",
          "This is really where anatomy began in a scientific sence. The room is amazingly beautiful, all in wood. Except the marble bench in the centre of the room. A must-see in Bologna at the main building of the world's oldest university.",
          "A visit to the Teatro is well worth half an hour of anyone's time, for a chance to experience what the pioneers of medicine must have felt like. The theatre is so atmospheric, and actually visiting when it is crowded is a great way to feel like a student, with everyone sitting",
          "This is a very grand room and a marked contrast to the functional spaces of modern scientific laboratories. The carved statues of famous classical medics and of skinned bodies are interesting but I found the room had far less atmosphere than the much smaller steeply raked",
          "4 of us visited the Archiginnasio Palace and this was a highlight, although the 2 12 year old children found the history of the anatomical theatre a bit gory as it was where anatomy was taught by dissecting dead bodies on the marble slab in the centre of the room. Today it is",
          "So cool and easy to imagine an anatomy lecture from 250 years ago. Also make sure to visit the old library on the same floor. These 2 attractions were the highlights of Bologna for us",
          "You feel like a medieval student there! You feel the ancients are still alive there! Absolutely adored it!",
          "Short but sweet visit. Situated in a beautiful building,up stairs of a courtyard.Wooden theatre and wooden statues all around.A peak into the library rooms through closed doors was fascinating.Decor in the halls were extraordinary.",
          "The theatre was badly bombed during the war but has been reconstructed. There is plenty of information in Italian and English. The place is very atmospheric and gives a good idea of how anatomy was taught way way back.",
          "The ticket gives you admission to the teatro anatomico and the stabat mater hall. The history of the building is described in several languages. Inside the stabat mater hall there is a beautiful see through of the old library. The longest old library I have ever seen.",
          "As you sit in this beautiful room of wood, gazing down upon a table with a marble slab, it is easy to imagine oneself in this oldest of universities being lectured by one of the ancient professors depicted around the room. Of course, the table was used to dissect bodies for the",
          "Beautifully reconstructed place. You can easily imagine how there's a body in the middle of the room being dissected by assistants of an old grey professor. Un vero viaggio nel tempo.",
          "A salutary reminder that anatomical teaching at the university was formerly done in a comparatively small lecture theatre, with wood paneling and mostly natural light. On a marble slab,with no white tiles. I can imagine it was quite atmospheric in its day as corpses were",
          "In any visit to Bologna be sure to see this. As well as being stunning in its own right, the Teatro Anatomico appears in every proper history book. Its place in the history of science is unrivalled, as well as being a work of art in itself.",
          "Worth visiting, especially because it is close to so many other great sites. Sitting here imagining what the students would watch as they learned. Certainly, this is one of the precursors to the current learning hospitals operation view rooms. This was destroyed by the Allied",
          "Simply not worth the money. A reconstructed place (destroyed during the II WWW) without any charm. Spend your euros at some other place or buy yourself a gelatto",
          "While the theatre is fascinating the building it is housed in and the library ion the building is even more fascinating",
          "Ok so it's a small area/building but the inside in beautiful and there is so much history on the walls you can understand unless your Italian but it still deserves a lot of respect. There is a theatre room which costs \u20ac3 each it's small but we believe \u20ac3 is a small price to pay",
          "This museum consists of 2 of the old teaching rooms from the original university and a very attractive courtyard. The walls are covered in many interesting frescos and the anatomy theatre is an interesting look into the past. At \u20ac3 to get in its one of the cheaper museums in the",

          "It is part of Archiginnaso museum. You can sit and imagine the anatomic classes took place there. How many corps !!!",
          "Photographs showed the damage caused to the building during the war, so it is amazing that it looks in such good shape now. You can imagine the bodies laid out on the marble slab in the middle of the theatre and the audience enraptured as the lecture takes place.",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit. It is a place where the medical students open bodies and study anatomy on 16 century. The lady that was receiving the tickets was very nice and explain me how everything work, she give me a very nice guided tour for free.",
          "Visiting the Anatomical Theatre was very interesting. To see where autopsies were first used and the human body studied at the oldest university in Europe was amazing",
          "This is truly a place were we felt the history of a building, is great that you can seat yourself in the rooms.",
          "Very bizarre place: everything is wooden, except the table top in the middle on which the corpses were. Should be visited at night, by moonlight only...",
          "Totally the highlight of my visit to Bologna! The place is so captivatingly atmospheric! The contrast between the lush wooden interior and the cold white cadaver table is as deep as the contrast between the living and the inanimate.. Beautiful, best \u20ac3 I ever spent. While there",
          "Absolutely amazing and beautiful anatomy theatre built entirely of wood apart from the dissecting table itself. What sights it must have seen. I just wish they would switch off the silly electric lights and let visitors soak up is real atmosphere (as well as being able to take",
          "This is a wonderful up close opportunity to sit in the same lecture theatre that the very first training doctors and medicos had access to. It is situated close enough to other many sights.",
          "Took ones breath away, the theatre and external halls just amazing and good value, and well worth a visit at 3 euro each.",
          "This is a reconstruction of the most famous anatomical dissection theatre in Europe, where Vesalius conducted dissection sessions in the 16th century. Not to be missed.",
          "this is not an essential site to visit. nor is it overly or even moderately interesting - historically or culturally. glad i went but nothing write home about.",
          "This remarkable room comprised virtually entirely of carvings associated with its role as an anatomical lecture theatre is truly impressive in terms of its skillful carving and historical interest. However it is relatively expensive and very little information is available to",

          "The history in this room that taught medical students Anatomy is just fabulous. There is a statue of a doctor holding a nose, who they say is the first plastic surgeon. The statues of the skinless bodies are to behold! Just sit awhile and take it all in.",
          "Two rooms in this palazzo are open to the public - the Teatro itself, adorned with wooden statues of ancient and Renaissance medical figures and, famously, two skinless figures holding up the canopy over the lecturer's chair - and the Sala Stabat Mater, named for the performance",
          "As a medical professional I am always interested in how things were done in previous centuries. This anatomy theater where countless bodies were dissected for the benefit of medical students in the 16th through the 19th centuries was stunning in its decorations. The marble",
          "If there is someone with you in the medical field, this is a must see. The woodwork alone is amazing, but to see where so much was discovered about the human anatomy is pretty cool.",

          "This is a stunning mediacal school lecture hall with beautiful wood carvings,statues and seating. In the middle there is a marble table where the bodies were displayed. The University of Bologna is the oldest in Europe and a must see when you visit this city.",
          "This attraction is one of the hidden gems of Bologna. The operating theatre dates from the 17th century, and the rich decor is highlighted by coats of arms and beautiful intricate carvings. The marble table in the center is original, and this is where lectures on operating",

          "This is a fascinating place to visit in a wonderful building. It is not a long visit, but it is well worth it. The room was rebuilt after the war, but still conveys the sense of history and drama from when it was used as an anatomy lecture theatre. Loved the skinless bodies used",
          "Wow, I really enjoyed this visit. The walk through the archway and up the stairs is so highly decorated that you could spend an hour just on the staircase. The anatomy room is spectacular and I wonder how many past students missed most of their lecture as they marvelled at the",

          "Visited this while in Bologna. Interesting to see how students learned anatomy. The rest of the museum was closed due to many military dignitaries visiting. Worth the 3 Euro admission.",
          "The history behind this place is amazing going back to the 16th century. Amazing detailed sculptures in wood not as normal and usual in marble. The background history behind this medical student theatre is well worth the visit as is the incredible collection of the peoplewho",
          "It was fascinating to see how small the room was. It brought you back in time, though. It also was interesting to find out that the first female professor in the world worked at the university in which this theater is located. The wood paneling and plaques are well preserved.",
          "As health care professionals my wife and I very much enjoyed our visit to this oldest medical school and anatomy theatre It has been beautifully retired and the the sculptures of physician teachers are moving. Fascinating",

          "The obvious highlight is the anatomical lecture theatre with its panelled walls, carvings and dissecting table, but the Stabat Mater Room was our favourite. The collection of old books is incredible as well as the decor. The building has lovingly restored using old material",
          "This is the highlight of the university of course. It is one room but it is interesting to see the carvings - the famous flayed men, and the dissecting table. You can sit on a bench and imagine you are there!",
          "Ever since seeing 'Italy Unpacked' this was one of my top attractions to visit in Italy. And it didn't disappoint either. The warm, wood paneling draws the walls in but in a non claustrophobic way. The statues are exquisite and there's a lovely serene atmosphere made even better",
          "Worth going to see the room because of historical connotations. Reading about the history very interesting",
          "great wood carving - good to sit and ponder early anatomical studies in a lecture theatre.hard to believe that this was rebuilt following war damage.",
          "An amazing place, that words cannot describe and a must. We had a guide, all seats and steps were taken when the guide spoke. Having walked for hours with the guide, fencing off seats wasn't helpful.",
          "This impressive room made of wood where anatomy was taught and we learn that Laura Bassi was the first female professor in the world at this university in 1755.",
          "Apart from the whole setting, it is definitely one of the most interesting sites in Bologna. The wood carvings are amazing. And with the same ticket you can visit the Lecture Hall, named Stabat Mater because Rossini's opera was performed there.",
          "A really nice place to visit. Actually one room in quite a large, brilliantly decorated old University Building (the Archiginnasio, reviewed elsewhere).",
          "Piece of history showing how anatomy was taught along the centuries to students of medicine. Although the building and the hall were badly hurt during WWII due to Italy's infamous role in that war, the hall has been well restored.",
          "a wonderful look into past teaching. the university of bologna is a must see. the woodwork is breathtaking",
          "We were surprised to learn that much of this building was destroyed during the bombing in WW2. It has been recreated beautifully and is a must-see in Bologna. It's just off Piazza Magiore so easy to access and a guide will help you unlock the history of the attraction.",
          "I admit I might have been over-hyped by previous reviews from readers, but all in all it was well worth the time to visit. The place is very well kept. We might have benefited from some more information on the site itself.",
          "Wonderful insight into the oldest university in the world. The Teatrico was largely rebuilt after a bombing in WWII but it's still amazing to sit in a scene you've probably only seen in a old paintings. Set in a lovely courtyard with beautifully decorated passages covered in",

          "Not only the anatomical theater is interesting but the surrounding rooms and corridors are gorgeous, even more interesting actually.",
          "THis is a small exhibit that is truly a sight to see. THe admission fee is small and you are able to see 2 rooms. I wish I could explore more places in this building. For me, as a medical professional, this brought back memories of when I was studying in school and it opened",

          "A highlight of the main sights of Bologna for anyone interested in academia, medicine, biology or history. The anatomical sculptures are particularly fascinating, as well as the carved wooden statues of all the important anatomists and biologists around the edge of the theatre.",
          "I loved the history and the detail in the wood-panelled room. Lots of interesting sculpture especially the skinned men holding up the professor's canopy. Definitely worth the 3 Euro admission.",
          "To see how this part of the world give us so much civilisation and knowledge - and so many hundreds of years ago - fascinating - 3 euros a bargain.",
          "A special place in the oldest European university. There was a reverence about the room. Some medical photos on display and admission to the library/lecture hall.",
          "This is one of the few surviving very early theatres built for anatomy lectures with a body laid out in the centre! It must be one of the oldest, if not the oldest, to survive. It was heavily damaged in the second world war but it has been faithfully and beautifully restored",
          "It's amazing to see how the Italians learned so much about the body and human medicine. This room has been beautifully restored and its very interesting. The museum provides handouts in 5 or 6 different languages. Your tickets for this room are also good for the library. It's $3",
          "Strange impression while visiting this teatro anatomico. The place is beautifully restored/rebuilded (after destruction during the war) and the table in white marble can easily make us imagine biology lessons that took place here a few centuries back",

          "Stunning. Wonderful building . Just amazing to see and imagine the teaching and learning. Do not miss.",
          "I was hoping to see more items/instruments illustrating the medical education of the time. The classroom was beautiful, with original woodwork and classroom seating, but boasted only the disection table. We didn't stay long, and neither did the other visitors.",
          "This site was impressive for the sheer idea that anatomical studies were conducted in this beautiful theater way back in the 1600s.",
          "For a few euros this old palace is well worth a short visit. You enter a marvellous arched courtyard and ascen stairs to either the library, primarily for student researchers, or climb further to the next galleried floor to view the anatomical theatre, complete with marble slab",
          "Small, but very historical. Amazing when you consider the history of this building. For 3 euros it is well worth the 30 minute visit.",
          "Not obvious where this is and we just came across it by accident as it is part of another museum. The dissecting room has the most amazing wooden carved figures and the skinless statues are fascinating if a bit creepy, certainly not one to miss",
          "for a couple of euros go in and look at this room. It has a history that dates back to early dissection and medical teaching. An excellent wooden room with wonderful carvings",
          "hard to imagine the lectures which must have taken place in this room. It is more than a little gory to imagine the dissections taking place in the centre of the room. I loved the colour of the aged pine panelling which covers the walls.",
          "The building is very intriguing. The anatomy theater is amazing and has excellent woodwork. It only takes a few minutes to see. But if the library hall is open, that is at least as interesting, as well as all of the painting on the walls. Hard to describe.",
          "An amazing restoration of the original anatomy theatre of the first medical school in Bologna home to the oldest university in Europe. Most of the building now houses an extensive library much of it digitized. There are some excellent exhibits in the public corridors and access",
          "The theatre itself is in the site of the old university. The theatre is a fine place to visit but make sure you look around the rest of the site and don't just go to the anatomical theatre alone.",
          "Beautiful building, it breathes history. This place is an absolute must-see for anyone working in a medical profession. I was humbled and awed.",
          "Really difficult for me to find-when you expand the google map on the website, it leads you to a square a couple of blocks from the place. The address is not Galvani 2 but Piazza Galvani 1- it is a stone's throw from Piazzo Maggiore. Entry is 3 euros and the room is lovely.",
          "The place has its own magic and you can feel it from the moment you walk in. The surrounding campus is also amazingly decorated with intricate arts and sculpture. The 'teatro' has English-German-Italian-French guide in front, so you can enjoy the amazing story of world's first",
          "Fascinating place. Wooden seating in tiers looking down on operating theatre where medical students could watch operations being performed. skeletal wooden statues",
          "Another great attraction in Bologna, near the centre of the city and with a small charge to enter but well worth the price:",
          "It is definitely interesting, if you are concern in medical history. The room has an atmosphere and it is also nicely decorated with woodwen covering and those skinneless sculptures.",
          "It is difficult now to understand how hard it was in the distant past for medical students to obtain an adequate knowledge of anatomy. This theatre shows how the students would sit around the dissection table with the lecturer seated up on high directing the work of assistants.",
          "This is a reconstruction because of bomb damage, but it's still a powerful place to see, and imagine how it must have been used by early medics to display the various workings of the human body.",
          "A small, wood panelled room with a marble slab in an enclosure in the centre, with tiered seats around and a 'throne' for the anatomist. Perhaps not much to see, but an interesting place to reflect on the advances in understanding and technology in medicine since it was built.",
          "The room was used for medical use long ago and it is located in an ild university , some said the first university ever built! The place is filled with flags and old books and decorations , some parts are transformed into library now",
          "The all-wood operating theatre is amazing. The rest of the building is well worth an explore. Not expensive and very interesting.",
          "We visited this museum on the recommendation of a couple we met. It was quite fascinating, but slightly unnerving! Well worth a look, though!",
          "Entrance fee is only for one little room, but this room is absolutely amazing. You can sit and at rest examine this beautiful room. It is one of the best places in Bologna. It is small room, so try visit it when there are not much people.",
          "You would think that centuries ago there were already anatomy lessons for students. The whole hall is very nicely renovated.",
          "Great disappointment : you will be charged 3 Euros for spending less than 5 minutes in this wooden theater. Nothing special at all. Besides, the official historical library on the same floor is only open to students! Foreigners are not allowed to visit it! Imagine the",
          "Beautiful site - outstanding woodwork. A step back in medical history to the 1500's. Short visit but well worth it.",
          "A trip to Italy is going to be rather heavy on the churches and the religious art. But this small museum offers one a chance to see some of the scientific fruition of the renaissance. My daughter (a premed major) and I spent a good half our in the anatomy theater thinking",
          "The atmosphere of the Teatro Anatomico in itself and the fact that only few tourists were visiting readily let your imagination wander back to the beginning of modern anatomy as one of the eagerly watching students.",
          "Interesting to see but only two rooms available to see. If you are around the corner anyway, then go - otherwise don't.",
          "Had a great wander around and was amazed to see the original autopsy table dating back to the 1700's. It's easy to imagine the medical students sitting in the theatre listening and watching their tutors. A pretty good place to visit and consider the history.",
          "Teatro Anatomico is a room where they used to dissect human corpses for educational purposes. It's built like an amphitheater and made from wood with statues on its walls, It's beautiful to see.",
          "The anotomical theatre, although sounding a bit gruesome is well worth a visit, just to witness the amazing restoration job that has been completed.",
          "Don't miss this quick and unique attraction. We didn't make it here until the very end of our trip, but we're so glad we saw it. It is awe-inspiring to stand in the room where so much of our modern medical knowledge originated.",
          "An amazing wee theatre where you can be seated and imagine back in time where autopsys were done infront of med students at the university. Nice statues etc also.",
          "A beautiful place. The surrounding belie the things that take place here. If you are in Bologna at the right time you can even watch and autopsy.",
          "Very interesting site showing the room in which the medecine students learnt how to practice anatomy. Unfortunately only one room to see.",
          "How do medical students learn anatomy? We take for granted that doctors understand the anatomy of the human body. In earlier times this activity was risky business. The ambience of this chamber underscored the importance of the teaching that took place. There are many steps but",
          "Didn't think I would be that interested in this attraction. It was very interesting.We went in late afternoon with no crowds and were able to take our time walking through. The building is very old with lots of history everywhere.",
          "This reconstructed gem looks like it has been there for centuries, which is actually true for much of it. The naked and apparently skinless body statues show every sinew, which was one of the teaching methods. The idea of sitting and watching a post mortem in this theatre is",
          "We had been looking forward to this one. The ornate wooden furnishings and the statues that surrounded the marble slab are so very far from our modern conception of anatomy and surgery. This room seems to sum up all that made Bologna a real centre of learning in the University's",
          "The University of Bologna, founded in 1088, is the oldest continuously-operated university in the world. The Archiniginnasio Palace was the first permanent seat of the this ancient Studium and was built in 1563. The Anatomy Theatre, where empirical anatomy was taught was built",
          "Teatro Anatomico must be seen while staying in Bologna - it's an astonishing mixture of art and science gathered in one room. The information cards provided us with detailed history of the place and Teatro itself is one of its kind piece of art. Cannot be ommited!",
          "The teatro visit is a must, it's very interesting to explore this room where great thinkers used to evolve. You'll be also able to visit the beautiful area of biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio where amazing fresco and several details are a must to see.",
          "We had a tour guide who explained the history of this place which I found very helpful. It is unlike any place I have visited.",
          "Much restored but gives a fascinating insight in to early pathology. Interesting statues of bodies. Worth a visit but does not take much time",
          "This exquisitely wooden carved room should be a must for any visitor to Bologna. The entrance and courtyard are stunning in themselves, but the room itself though fairly small is amazing to experience. Much of the palazzo has been restored after destruction in WWII but the",
          "Amazing room to visit. the details on the walls and the ceiling are stunning. The Anatomical Theatre is carved in wood, and dates from 1637. It is amazing to learn that it was almost completely destroyed during WWII but rebuilt using the original fragments.",
          "It was neat to be in a very old university lecture hall, designed for anatomic lectures. The hallways in the Archiginnasio Palace display ancient crests with coats-of-arms of students who attended the university centuries ago. We thought these were really different kind of",
          "The beautifully decorated and carved panelled room and cedar seating was beautiful and really good. The marble slab with a timbered guardrail was really quite graphic and the description of the vivisection of human bodies really brought things to live (?!!) Not at all gruesome",
          "Just a short walk from the center of old Bologna, this experience is worth the 3\u20ac entry fee. The location of the first autopsies performed, it was almost destroyed in WWII by allied bombing. The restored room is where doctors did the first autopsies while medical students and",
          "The Teatro Anatomico is a special place to visit. Medical students got their education here. In the centre of the hall the dissection table is, surrounded by benches. It reminds of the famous picture of Rembrandt, but now without a body. It's clear that even in old times one",
          "You have to remember that it's an authentic table for anatomical dissection of the most ancient University of the word...nine hundred years ago! Gianni of Bologna",
          "Do not forget that whatever you visit was just built after WW2. Moreover it is just a small classroom whose photographs you can see here on the web. Thus visit it only you have extra wasting time. Do not miss the wooden statue of Gasparo Tagliacozzi who is the pioneer plastic",
          "A worthwhile chance to look back into Medical training history, wow the smell must have been interesting then as well! Up close and personal with the dissecting table in such surroundings!",
          "This place is the birth place of modern medicin. A place where we can wonder how centuries ago students learned. A must see in Bologne. 3\u20ac entrance",
          "This slice of history is awe inspiring. Although Bologna had been heavily bombed in the war and certain parts of the Teatro were destroyed this piece of medical history is wonderful. The theatre where physicians would have studied is really wonderful and the marble slab of the",
          "This was a fascinating space. The Anatomical Theatre where medical students used to go to learn about anatomy. The room is naturally lit with beautiful tall windows and the benches are so narrow that you couldn't possibly fall asleep on them so that the students didn't miss any",
          "this is a place where medical history has been written...lectures in anatomy have taken place here since centuries. Beautiful place.",
          "one of the most amazing things to see in bologna. the history that this class room withholds is amazing. the courtyard of the building is really nice, the light and its reflections were charming. must see while in bologna",
          "This is where students were explained the human body. They were invited to bring whichever dead people they could find to show how anatomy works. Had to undergo major 'surgery' of its own after allied bombings during WWII. The restorations are well done. I can recommend a guide",
          "great opportunity to look at history of medicine - classic design, the wax models in Bolgna also complemented this slice of history. keep an eye out for the grotesque.",
          "The University of Bologna has a wonderful special history....longstanding...and one of the oldest universities...and the Teatro Anatomico is special because of its early work in the study of the human body. A tour guide is very helpful as there are many items in the room, and on",
          "This building is all wooden and it is quite a sensation to stand in the room and imagine the dissections of human bodies being done here years ago.",
          "A fascinating small place in the world that's well worth the tiny entrance fee. Fascinating if you are at all interested in learning, medicine or universities. All the other rooms of the old university are amazing as well.",
          "Whilst walking, we came across the Palazzo Archiginnasio. It was\u2019t on our list of places to visit, but we thought we\u2019d pop in and have a look and I'm glad we did. It was the first permanent seat of the Studium or University of Bologna and was built in 1563. Its aim was to",

          "The building that this is in is very attractive, lots of frescoes, great staircases and the library is here. It is easy to miss the entrance though, although the square itself is easy to find, its next to the Piazza Maggiore, the cafe Zanzarini is on this square also. We paid 3",
          "If you're visiting bologna, make this stop. Sit in the room and imagine what was happening in there.",
          "It is only a replica for the original that was destroyed in a World War II bombing. But the woodcarvings are amazing! It really is impressing to enter the room and imagine what it was like back in the day when it would've been full of students. The painted porticos on the",
          "The courtyard and staircases are very beautiful, however, the Teatro itself is quite small and crowded.",
          "I was utterly fascinated by the Teatro Anatomico. Of course, I am quite biased, since I am a pathologist. I was spell-bound to stand in one of the places where the mystery of human (and animal) anatomy was first revealed during the Renaissance. (Of course, I realize that",
          "If you're not a doctor, or a medicine student, or a medicine history freak, better spend your money on something else. I thought that it's going to be a museum of human anatomy. My mistake.",

          "We were glad we stuck our heads in and the walked all around this baroque building and courtyard. The information for tourists and maps are so incomplete, it is hard to know what to really see. This building is a wonderful example of Bologna architecture at its best.",
          "3 euros gets in you in to the theatre and the library. The theatre is very cool and you can age what it would have been like watching an autopsy there. We went on a Sunday but got there for a number of your groups. There seemed to be an abundance of your groups around the",
          "Part of the University of Bologna & one of the earliest anatomy dissecting rooms. Wonderful wood panelled walls & ceiling. Very interesting glimpse into early medicine. Very reasonable entrance charge - just a few euros. Highly recommend a visit.",
          "A part of the University of Bologna, some of the earliest scientific explorations as to how the human body worked were done in this theatre. The theatre itself was completely rebuilt after being bombed during WW2. A really interesting place to visit with only a nominal entry",
          "This is quite a find as there are not too many of the anatomical theatres left. This is a place where students of medicine used to watch dissections of the human body but is decorated in an ornate style more befitting a stately home than a lecture theatre. The room is situated",
          "This was well worth the 4 Euro entrance fee. The wooden anatomical carvings and design of the room were fantastic! The law school lecture room was also interesting, and we spent an hour or so on the grounds. I will visit it agin when we return to Bologna.",
          "A beautiful hand carved wood dissection room built to rival the one in Padova. The carved sculptures where the lecturer stands is supported by two figures that show the muscles in an anatomically correct way. The famous men on the wall are all historic figures in health and",
          "I can honestly say this was maybe the most interesting thing seen in Bologna, for me, as a doctor, that is. It can bring up nice memories, and being surrounded by the sculptures of all those men that had an impact on Medicine, has a nice feel to it. After walking in the sun,",
          "Lovely detailed carving, leaflets available in English explaining all. You can sit on the lower benches and take it all in.",
          "As others have pointed out, it is easy to expect more - then you will be disappointed. It is one impressively decorated theatre, actually rebuilt since it was bombed in 1944. Still worth the visit and 3euro entry fee, but if you miss it it's not a disaster.",
          "I visited during a hot day in summer with a group of art history students and our professor as acting guide. She explained the history of the room as an autopsy arena: They would operate on people with the surrounding benches packed with onlookers and candles lighting the room.",
          "fantastic place to visit - the home of human anatomy. To stand where those students stood and think what they learned is amazing. fantastic woo carving - especially when you realise it was ruined during the War and later rebuilt.",
          "I was expecting more based on the reviews. It is a very historical room and is nice to look at, but I was disappointed that you had to pay \u20ac3. It's just a small room where they used to teach anatomy by dissecting cadavers. The carvings on the ceiling are neat. But, again, I was",
          "I had wanted to go here since seeing a TV documentary it featured in. It was amazing, as is the whole building. Lucky students to be able to study in such a beautiful place (lecture halls elsewhere in the building are still in use today). Do go and see it. Entrance just 3 Euros",
          "It's quite a room as rooms go. Signposting is a little unclear -- you need to look for the Biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio in which it is housed rather than look for signs for the theatre itself.",
          "We visited last week and were blown away.Its hard to describe the wonderful carvings and the history here.the library that is jioned to the teatro is also worth alook around as it is very historic and beatuful",

          "Even though this is a reconstruction after the war it's amazing to think that thebuilding has been operating as a university for almost 1000 years.",
          "As part of the Archiginnasio of Bologna, you can pay an extra \u20ac3 (from what I remember) to visit the Teatro Anatomico and another lecture room. - To be honest, I prefered the second room to this one, as the colours were absolutely beautiful - however that is not to say that this",
          "really nice room, covered in wood panels and sculptures, but the lightening is not good and the sheet that they give you with the description could be improved!",
          "Of course I've seen photos of this anatomy/dissection theatre, and TV programmes about it too so it wasn't entirely suprising - but still, what a wonderful little room. Entirely wood - wooden seats, wood paneling, wooden sculptures and statues, including the two grisly ones",
          "Stunning discovery in this amazing building, which was extensively damaged by the Allies during the War. Thank goodness this was saved.",
          "While it is a replica of the original destroyed during the war, the Teatro Anatomico is a rare glimpse of an early Medical School.The woodwork and sculptures are attractive and the center marble slab stark and forbidding.",
          "Great space to visit and imagine what education used to be. The \"skinless\" statues and the marble table add atmosphere to this wood-paneled space. Note that there is a 3 Euro charge - this did not show in all of my guide materials.",
          "A great insight into the training of doctors centuries ago. the museum is also worth seeing after sitting in the theatre it was hard to believe that a wax model of various parts of the anatomy could be realistic. But they are.",
          "Tried to visit this place 3 times: the building was always closed. Apparently they are open just a couple of hours each day. No opening hours are displayed at the entrance.",

          "Although this wasn't the easiest to find, as it is on the second floor of what appears to be a library and the signs on the outside are confusing, if you can't locate it the tourist information office int he main square will direct you. It is free and the building it is located",
          "Definitely worth a visit, like nothing I\u00b4ve seen anywhere else. Gives you a real sense of what academic education might have been like back in the days.",
          "Built in the 15th century as part of the University of Bologna Medical School, Teatro Anatomico is the the theater-in-the-round lecture hall where Bologna's foremost physicians taught anatomy to prospective medical students by placing cadavers on a marble slab. You've got to",
          "Bologna is a famous center of learning, and in this nearly 400-year-old theater (credited to Antonio Levante) made of cedar and fir, medical students watched dissection of corpses to better understand the human body. Looking down from one end of the gallery are the famous",

          "Located in the city center, easy to access, most impressive. Feels that a side door will suddenly open and students with their teacher will beam from the past. Very well preserved. You can take photos, also.",
          "Free entry to this place definitely makes it worth a visit. Although damaged by bombings, it has been beautifully restored and the woodwork is really beautiful. Haunting sculptures and gives a great insight into how Anatomy was taught before.",
          "Very interesting place, not at all gruesome. Certainly makes you think about how modern medicine started.",
          "Sadly bombed in the war and reconstructed but a faithful rebuild and the skinned wooden bodies are world famous...if you are in Bologna you really shouldn't miss it",
          "On your way to visit Teatro Anatomico be amazed at the hundreds of family coats of arms on walls and ceilings of this extraordinary building. When you have rested on seats in the Teatro do ask a member of staff to open up the library famous for first performance of Rossini's",

The facade was not added till 1905. The sanctuary houses the sculptural group of Sorrow over Dead Christ (1463) by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca.\n\n\n== Oratorio dei Battuti ==\n\nIn the adjacent oratory, built between 1604 and 1617 to designs by Floriano Ambrosini, is a Madonna with child and Saints (1550) by Nosadella and a Transit of the Madonna (bodily assumption), a group of 14 statues in terracotta (1522) by Alfonso Lombardi. On the niches of the walls are statues of St Proculus and St Petronius by the famed sculptor Alessandro Algardi, as well as by Giulio Cesare Conventi (St Francis and St Domenic). In 1275, the local Confraternita dei Battuti Bianchi, a confraternity of flagellants was organized and supported a hospital at the site.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The views would be wonderful, especially if taking the 'noddy train' up the hill, avoiding the climb - but our Sunday morning was the only time to go.... and the cloud was very low (or the fog very thick! No views - we stayed on the land train to coe back down!!",
          "This is a beautiful building. One of the highlights is the moving collection of terracotta figures, the Compianato sul Christo morto by Niccolo dell'Arca. In the nearby oratory there are more beautiful terracotta figures by Alfonso Lombardi. They are well woth seeing.",
          "Tiny church with a treasure inside. The Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Vita is located in the city center, in via Clavature 10, very close to the main square, Piazza Maggiore. Inside the church is the \u201cCompianto sul Cristo Morto\u201d, a moving and powerful sculptural ensemble",
          "Worth a visit if you are in the area. Fairly modest by comparison with other churches in the region, but still beautiful.",
          "Read about this church on TA. Entrance to church is free but you have to pay 3 euros to see The Lamentation over the dead body of Christ and the Oratory. Well worth it. The details of the terracotta sculpture is incredible. Especially the figure of Mary Magdalene. You can almost",
          "A must visit in Bologna to see dell'Arca's Il Companiato which must be the most understated art work in history. A beautiful and moving experience. Church is closed on Monday's",
          "The exterior doesn't draw attention, but the interior is calm and beautiful. Take a few moments and visit this church!",
          "What makes this church stand out from the many other churches in Bologna are the statues in this church. Entrance is free. A must see.",
          "Well worth the visit. Did not disappoint in any way. Visited as many churches/chapel as we could when in Bologna and this one certainly didnt come up short.",
          "We read about the oratory outside the church and went in. We were told it was closed and must have looked dejected because an elderly, non English speaking woman took us upstairs. They were repairing the cracks in the floor and didn't want anyone stepping on the repairs. The",
          "We had walked past this church a number of times before going inside on a walking tour. FANTASTIC. The history of the church and the terracotta figures are a must. Free entry and be respectful of where you are.",
          "Forget about the wooded terracotta sculptures about the death of Christ which are pretty grotesque and NOT to everyone's taste. (will give some people nightmares for weeks) But you should go upstairs to the Oratory and check out the sculptures there. They are 10 times better.",
          "The church is small, but it's really charming. The sculptures and the paintings are very beautiful, and they are combined perfectly to create a really magical place.",
          "Church like many in Italy.Easy located in close to city centre so if you have nothing else to do....",
          "The church was part of a hospital and was founded around 1250 by the Congregation of Flagelatti, whose members, as the name suggests, used to whip themselves. It was rebuilt in the 17th century and while the church itself is interesting, if you pay E3 or so you can see the true",
          "My wife normally does the detailed itinerary planning for what we will do and see in any given location. If, as often happens, our holiday is a last-minute thing, then I may have little idea of what activities and sights may have a place in our outline schedule. And so it was in",
          "The statues by Niccolo' dell'Arca in the church of Santa Maria della vita are something so beautiful, so out of this world...And to think you have to pay only 3 \u20ac to see them...And I am not even catholic (anymore)...The grief on the faces is so real and universal and of all",
          "But please look inside. From the ouside just a small entrance but go inside. Fabulous. Paid the 3 euros and worth it but even if you prefer not to pay make sure you visit all on offer.",
          "Without a doubt, this was my favorite church in Bologna. Located near the market, and sandwiched between other buildings, you could easily miss it. From the street, you may not even recognize that its a street. The interior is certainly ornate enough to impress. But,",
          "The building archtechture and historical value are awesome! If it wasn't for getting hungry, I could have spent hours there. Deffinately a must see while in Bolongia.",
          "It's easy to miss this place in Bologna, you are walking around amazed at how beautiful the city is and could walk straight past. Thankfully my husband is very inquisitive and we did visit. It was just amazing. We went two days in a row, one day it was just a quick visit as we",
          "The church itself is very beautiful but the real must see is the Group of Sorrow over Dead Christ by Niccolo dell'Arca. These terracotta sculptures are life size and the anguish on the faces takes your breath away. There is a 3 euro cost but you can visit the art of the first",
          "We happened on this church whilst walking through the market and I have to say what a spectacle this piece of art is. The cost is 3 euro and for that you get to see the 1st floor art also and it gives you discount to 3 other museums. Do not miss this . It is wonderful .",
          "Very easy visit to this church, just few steps from Piazza Maggiore. Ticket 3 euro (free access to church) for the sculptural group of Sorrow over Dead Christ (1463) by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca, it worths the cost. They are real size and impressive. No tickets for oratory. There you",
          "On our stop in Bolgona we make a cirquit around old city. Chiesa di Santa Maria is enormous and beautifull. Also surounded small street with local specialities",
          "Not a destination attraction like Santa Stefano or the basilica, but worth a look while walking in the area. On the other hand, you'll find it calming and less crowded when you've had enough of the hustle and bustle.",
          "Smaller church but nonetheless beautiful, calm and peaceful. On one of the side streets off piazza maggiore towards the market. Pop in whilst passing by",
          "This is a beautiful church and the central draw is the \"Sorrow over Dead Christ\" by Niccol\u00f2 dell' Arca. (1463). It is an incredible piece by one the 2-3 top artists in all of Italy (in our view). See his marble pieces in Santa Dominica in this city.",
          "I don't understand how people can complain about a small \u20ac3 charge to see such amazing artwork. Who pays the staff & the upkeep of the building (and by the way the staff were lovely). The rest of this church is amazing and free of charge but don't miss out on Compianto sul",
          "Magnificent structure. I have seen many churches and this ranks among the best. Well worth the visit",
          "I took the lazy route on the little tourist train-bus which was very bumpy and juddery. This church is still very much used for worship and prayer so it is best to pay due respect during the visit. It is a beautiful space with an air of quiet contemplation. The light levels in",
          "This church is a small wonder. The Compianto sul Christo Morto is an amazing piece. Pictorial reproductions do not really prepare you for the visceral impact of this work - so unlike so much other church art. That it is made of terracotta and has survived so long is",
          "This is well worth a visit. It looks small from the outside but is amazing inside. The Compianto sul Cristo Morto is stunning and a definite must if you visit Bologna",
          "The Compianto sul Cristo Morto, made of terracotta by Niccolo dell'Arca, is worth seeing and is truly a remarkable work of art. However I really resent paying 3 Euro per person for a view of this set of figures inside of a church. I would have understood a donation request",
          "Much more impressive on the inside than on the outside. Like San Pietro, is somewhat tucked between larger palazzos and so on. But the inside is impressive. The Compianto sul Cristo Morto, worked in terracotta by Niccolo dell'Arca, is worth seeing (costs 3 euros).The visit to",
          "The statues showing the grief of the followers of Jesus over his body are very life-like and moving, but you will have to pay 3 euros for the privilege of seeing them. Worth it, though.",
          "This church houses dell'Arca's Compianto, a group of terracotta figures depicting the Lamentation. The figure of Mary Magdalene is one of the most powerful sculptures of the Italian Renaissance. It is truly awesome. You will not forget it.",
          "Worth visiting, the inside holds more beauty than the exterior could ever suggest. I believe there is a charge to enter however my boyfriend and I were able to go inside with the Bologna Welcome walking tour for free. The Compianto sul Cristo morto statue is incredible to behold.",
          "a must see, to find back this peace feeling that you have lost in your travels. check every corner and visit around sunset.",
          "The church isn't too impressive from the outside, but inside it is very special with an amazing collection of life size terra cotta figures showing extreme emotions (extra fee to enter), We were told by a woman working there to go up to the Oratorio, which is free, to see more",
          "Other reviewers have been so effusive that I hesitate to either diminish or extol the place. I thought it was a precious treasure, a small gem with a lovely, remarkable, life-sized grouping of terracotta sculptures. What make an impression was what a lovely whole the place",
          "It is within this church that the more famous Compianto by Niccolo dell'Arca is. There are seven figures. Madonna, John the Evangelist, Joseph of Arimathea, Mary of Joseph, John the Apostle and Mary of Clopas, and of course Christ. Niccolo was an early renaissance sculptor, C",
          "We visited this place while guided Tours organized by the information centre and it was great. The fuide talked About emotions in sculptures",
          "We went mainly to see the terracotta sculptures and they were amazing. The expressions on their faces are incredible. Make sure and visit the ones upstairs too where there is also a beautiful ceiling. There is an elevator if the stairs are a problem.",
          "A modest church outside and inside but with a lovely feel. The dome and ceiling artwork is beautiful. In the adjacent oratory you can see the 14 terracotta statues by Alfonso Lombardi for a small fee.",
          "The lamentation scene with life-size teraccota figures is extremely expressive - almost distorting the figures faces...the level of expressiveness is surprising for the years it was executed....",
          "We stumbled across this while exploring the back streets around the Piazza Maggiore. It was Baroque enough to be interesting, luckily - over the top Baroque normally puts me off. Sadly, I didn't know about the Oratorio until afterwards. Worth checking out.",
          "For such a small church, compared to some stunningly large ones throughout Italy, it has one of the greatest art treasures I've ever seen! The Italian early Renaissance Niccolo dell'Arca terracotta sculptures are breathtakingly gorgeous and shouldn't be missed. One of the things",
          "We had only a few hours in Bologna so we took a bus instead of walking through the arched pathway. We went there for the panoramic view but we were a little disappointed. The church is on top of the hill which provides a nice panaroma of Bologna.",
          "This church seems pretty nondescript from the outside. It's in a little alleyway and you'll miss it if you weren't looking for it. But... you MUST look for it! The church itself is quite small compared to the other grand basilicas/cathedrals/churches in Italy but its Oratorio",
          "We saw many churches in the Bologna historic Centre, and they were all great. But Santa Maria Della Vita, was the greatest! Small, but so peaceful and artful!!! The four statues with their inscriptions in Greek are very impresive! If you have to see one church, that should be",
          "I kept walking passed as it's not obvious. Firstly when you enter the church is small but so ornate. It has a beautifully painted dome and beautiful statues. But the winner for me are the Terracotta statues, well worth the \u20ac3. I'm not sure what I expected but they are",
          "The terracotta statues in this church have to be one of my favourite things in Bologna. Simply amazing for their fluidity and emotional expression. Costs 3 euros for entry. The church is very close to P. Maggiore.",
          "You could easily miss this tiny church when visiting Bologna but don't! The terracotta statues in the church downstairs are incredibly moving, the facial expressions are so anguished. There is also a lovely oratorio upstairs with another beautiful set of terracotta statues and",
          "Beautiful church, tucked away on via Clavature, but the real treasures are the 2 groups of terracotta statues: one in the Oratorio (the Transit of the Madonna) and the second in the Sanctuary (the Lamentation of the Christ). The latter group is simply breathtaking. The",
          "The smallish church is a pleasant, but not overly exciting, Baroque one. It would probably be just another \"church tourist attraction\" if it weren't for the fact that it has one of the most emotionally expressive and shocking group of sculptures ever created in art history. It",
          "As is often the case, I find the \"lesser\" churches to be more beautiful than a city's duomo. This church is breathtaking with classic Italian architecture. Do not miss it.",
          "A lovely Italian church. What makes it super special is Compianto sul Cristo morto, the sculptures by Niccol\u00f2 dell\u2019Arca. This group of terra cotta statues will move you to tears. My favorite work of art in Italy, perhaps in the world. Go see it.",
          "Maybe the most beautiful church in the town. It is very small but the roof is very nice. It worth the visit.",
          "This is a small church but really lovely, it is free to enter but you must pay to see the famous terra cotta statues.",
          "Had to visit this church to see the Niccolo dell'Arca terracotta figures that featured in the BBC4 \"Renaissance Unchained\" series by Waldemar Januszczak. These sculptures are in the sanctuary side chapel and worth the E3 charge to view them. Hard to believe that they date from",
          "Worth a visit to see the life-size statues in the church and the oratory upstairs. A surprising find and very interesting.",
          "Pay the \u20ac3 to see the diorama of Jesus after being on the cross! There is a stunning accompanying explanation and the attention to detail is beautiful",
          "You will never looking at the photos think this is worth much of a look in ; but don't be fooled , this is a real hidden gem.",
          "We rented an apartment on Via Clavature in Bologna basically for the view and proximity to Piazza Maggiore with its various activities but were pleasantly suprised on our first foray out and about to encounter this beautiful church just down the via! There were services daily",
          "Had a good look round the Iconic church, which charged nothing for entrance, although there are collection boxes in you want to donate. It is very tranquil although right in the centre of town. Also very good souvenir shop which you can visit to show your support to the monks.",
          "Must see, hidden among picturesque shops in the very centre of Bologna, colourful church, remnant of old glory",
          "It really is worth paying extra (I think 2-3 euros) to see Nicolo Della Arca's sculptures. Where else can you quietly contemplate beautiful art like this at close range without being in a crowd. The guide to the art is in English too and adds to your appreciation.",
          "Not to be missed! - Niccolo dell'Arca was a magician, sculpting out of terracotta figures in mourning around the body of Christ - Mary Magdalene will astonish!",
          "Find this small church close to Piazza Maggiore to look at the amazingly powerful terracotta sculpture 'Lamentation over the Dead Body of Christ' by Niccolo dell'Arca. The figures are spellbinding. Well worth the \u20ac3 you have to pay. Couldn't visit the Oratory to see the Lombardi",
          "Out of the hustle and bustle of Bologna streets, step inside and feel the peace and quiet. A huge church taking up a small area of grount.",
          "The most amazing piece of sculpture I have ever seen! It is magnetic and compelling. The image has remained with me and will for a very long time.",
          "The sculpture of The Lamentation of Christ is the most impressive artwork I have ever seen. Considering it was made during the Renaissance, each part sent to different churches and finally brought back to be displayed together, it is amazing that they look so fresh. The",
          "Admire Nicolo dall'Arca's Lamentation of Christ first. Enjoy the Death of the Virgin group of Lombardi in the adjacant Santuario for free. Finally see the Lamentation of Christ of Lombardi in the Cathedral. It will refresh your mind on terracotta art.",
          "Don't judge a book by its cover. If you decide to give this oratory a miss because of its unimpressive exterior, then you will miss the opportunity to admire one of the most spectacular craving, sculptures, mason masterpiece in a church. Clear historical explanation in both",
          "On a day trip to Bologna we wanted to track down the Church to see the sculptures by Lombardi (they had figured in a BBC2 Renaissance programme by Waldemar Januszczak that we saw in March) . Hard work finding (ask at the tourist office), but well worth it. Spiritually moving.",
          "We have visited many churches in our travel, however, this one stands out as unique. In a side chapel of the church of Santa Maria Della Vita, there are seven life size sculptures made of terracotta, the \"Compianto\" by Nicolo dell'Arca. It is shocking and unsettling. Christ is",
          "A nice church, but what really out-stands is the display of 15th century terracotta figures that look as though they are a modern art installation from last week. The upstairs oratory is also very nice, although it's a lot of high up stuff.",
          "All over Bologna, you'll come across churches with amazing interiors, even if the outside is pretty unimpressive. The Santa Maria looks impressive from the outside too, with a large dome dominating the skyline. Really impressive artwork and stained glass inside, but you have to",
          "The moment you walk in to the cathedral the sculptures above you and the atmosphere as a whole will take your breath away. A must visit in Bologna.",
          "Inside the church is a fantastic 15th century group of sculptures by Niccolo dell'Arca that captures the horror of seeing Christ dead. The 3 euro charge was well worth it. And upstairs in the adjoining museum for free is another interesting group of sculpture of the apostles",
          "Don't leave Bologna without visiting Santa Maria della Vita. It is truly stunning inside. Allow at least 40 mins to appreciate all the frescoes.",
          "No matter how many churches you visit in Italy they all impress and this is no different. With glorious art and sculpture .",
          "There is so much to look at in the Sanctuary: statues, art, murals. Absolutely breahtaking. Friendly staff who go above and beyond to help you find your way (in Italian, even if you don't understand...). The most beautiful place in Bologna we've seen so far, and hard to imagine",
          "OK it is a lovely church and worth seeing but the fee for the statues is too much and I felt it was not worth it and my time and money would have been better spent elsewhere, The group of figures is not a major attraction.",
          "This church has easy access and should be visited by anyone interested in art and history. The church is vast and filled with memorable art. What is most incredible is located in a side area of the church: life-sized carvings of individuals reacting to the sight of the body",
          "Don't miss this if your in Bologna. The terracotta sculptures are stunning and moving and well worth 3\u20ac. If it's still there the photo exhibition upstairs is not to be missed and the film of the Spanish miners screen test is entrancing.",
          "Loved this little church that looks rather unimpressive from the outside, but that has great cuppolas, amazing terracotta statues (3euro) and currently a photo exhibition. well worth a stop to look at this place.",
          "The church itself is nice but the highlight is certainly the amazing Sorrow over Dead Christ terracotta sculptures.",
          "A small church with some beautiful art, definitely worth the \u20ac3 entry fee. Notably there were two beautiful sculptures and, at the time of our visit, some modern portraits. Definitely a must visit.",
          "We happened upon this lovely church by accident - it's easy to miss as the entrance is small and inconspicuous. The terracotta statues - Compianto del Cristo Morto - are breathtaking and well worth the 3 euro entrance fee.We were in Bologna during the photography biennale, and",
          "In this small street in the center of Bologna ,you will find this beautiful church ,perfect for a pray and light a candle.It is my favorite I have many memory of this church ,the only think ,they charge you now 3 Euro for see this gourges group of statue at the right of the",
          "This is a beautiful church. Really easy to miss though - the entrance is unassuming. A real surprise when you walk in - it's really magnificent.",
          "The entrance is narrow and easy to miss, but once inside ypu are blown away by the architecture. We only stayed a few minutes, lit a candle and said a prayer.",
          "The entrance is small and narrow and you may have walked pass it without noticing, but the inside is amazing as all churches in Italy are. But if you're lucky, there is also the exhibition of the architecture, paintings, and art works inside and you can visit it for free.",
          "Not many take the time to walk inside, I think. There was an organist playing lovely music so I lit and candle and enjoyed it.",
          "In a city of churches this one is good. But what really makes this visit a must are the 15th century terra cotta statues in a niche beside the main altar. You have to take some time to look at the expressions that the artist captured. Quite moving.",
          "Bologna has many beautiful churches, it is difficult to pick out any particular points, but this one stands out. The interior is quite exquisite.",
          "Peaceful and tranquil in a sea of noise. Wonderful terracotta figures of the pieta scene. Women need to dress modestly to gain entrance.",
          "You could almost walk past it.Free entry. Very impressive. In the sanctuary there are terracotta sculptures. Then bravely walk past Italian lady into the Oratory. Stunning.",
          "Unfortunately they don't allow photos inside. Houses a very good terra cotta sculpture mourning death of Christ.",
          "While San Petronio on Piazza Maggiore is better to forget, Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Vita is a must-see (like Santo Stefano). The church is beautiful and there are different spots such a museum to visit. Friendly volunteers will guide you in it. All free of charge.",
          "The main attraction here is the group of terra cotta sculptures made by Niccolo dell'Arca in the 15th century. What spoiled the whole experience was the two Trip Advisor signs at the entrance to the church. I do think Trip Advisor is great and use it for all my trips but when a",
          "Beautiful Church, in the downtown of Bologna. Your mind will get relaxed and rejuvenated. Paintings on the roof are impressive. Inside Church some parts are restricted for prayers only and not allowed for just visiting",
          "This little gem down a side street is not the most obvious as you walk past, but as you step in it is jaw droppingly beautiful. It is quite compact but very tall and the way the light enters below the dome is amazing. The main attraction is an amazing set of sculptures that",
          "We almost walked straight past this church, thinking the sculpture would be a workaday late-Renaissance effort- what a mistake that would have been. I have honestly never seen anything like this tableau. The church used to be linked to a hospital and there's a theory that",
          "The \u201c Compianto sul Cristo morto \u201c, a terracotta group of figures in the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Vita is a life-size group of six separate figures standing in a semicircle lamenting the dead Christ lying before them. The expressions of the grief and torment of the",
          "Also stumbled upon this church. We were in Italy for 2 weeks and this is the church I keep thinking of. The Mourning of Christ is a must see, just an amazing sight.",
          "This is a beautiful old church with great sculptures and paintings. The ceiling is a must see. No queues or large crowds and no fees. One of the better chapels you will see in Italy. Well worth your time.",
          "I accidentally stumbled upon Santa Maria della Vita after I was not allowed to enter the Basilica without a shawl, and I am extremely glad I did! The church itself is full of so many beautiful sculptures and paintings, surprising especially because it is a relatively small",
          "I'm originally from Bologna and every time I'm back in town, I go and have a look at those amazing statues, with the most intensive facial and gestural expressions I have ever seen.",
          "This is a beautiful old church without the queues, crowds and admission fees! A joy to walk round and for a traditional Italian church it is actually quite bright inside with some lovely side chapels , pictures and sculptures Well worth a visit",
          "Close to P. Maggiore, and free admission and amazing life like sculptures. What else need be said. If anywhere near P. Maggiore make the small detour to the church",
          "The church is beautiful in itself, but as you enter you are overwhelmed with beautiful pieces of art surrounding you. As you venture further you discover \"Il compianto sul Cristo Morto\" which is breathtaking and very moving. I visited 3 times in my 4 day stay in Bologna. Not to",
          "The building itself from the outside is lovely but when you venture inside it is breathtaking! Beautiful artwork, sculptures and architecture! Well worth a visit",
          "\"Il compianto sul Cristo morto\" - a breathtaking group - sculpture by Niccolo dell'Arca - represents the highlight of this Sanctuary. I stood there for a few minutes and analyzed the expression of the sculptures. They were really communicating sufferance at an unbearable level.",
          "This place has some real nice statues which worth the visit! Also the little street the church is found on is very romantic.",
          "I read about this Sanctuary and had seen some photos of the scene where Christ was taken down from the cross and figures surrounding were visibly upset as they looked down at his body. Now, I have been to many churches, but this was the first time I was brought to tears while",
          "Luckily a friend living in Bologna told us about this marvelous church which houses Niccolo dell Arca's wonderful sculptures from the fifteenth century. They are magnificent and worthy of a special visit. This is also a beautiful church which has other impressive artwork.",
          "This is a very peaceful place even if there are quite a few visitors. It was fantastic to get so close to the Lombardi sculptures - they really are evocative & slightly scary!",
          "This is a beautiful church with a very interesting sculpture. They have a written piece about it which is worth a read.",
          "Having almost walk past this little place it is hidden within a street and looks like a normal church from the outside it is definitely worth a peak inside. It is amazing to look at the detail of the carvings and sculptures within this church they are beautiful and a must seen",
          "Niccol\u00f2 dell\u2019Arca's 15th century terracotta figures showing five characters from the bible around the body of the dead figure of Jesus is like nothing else in the art world showing this scene. They show the real human horror and grief of such an experience and make a big",
          "The Compianto is made of seven statues and is incredibly sculpted. It generated emotion when we saw it.",
          "-This beautiful church is close to central square and one should certainly see this church, if you are in Bologna. (will take max one hour ); We stumbled upon this beautiful architecture while wandering, and how lucky we were. ( It will help, if you read a bit before visiting )",
          "we spent some considerable time here and had read up on the history of the church in advance. This really helped us to get the special atmosphere of this truly beautiful space.",
          "Make sure you also visit the upper room, where there is different terracotta statue. Read a few words in advance or search for the explanations you can appreciate what you are seeing.",
          "We stumbled on this church whilst wandering around Bologna. Entry is free and there is an attached museum which is also free. The highlights are two groups of terracotta statues which are unusual and worth seeing.",
          "Church Santa Maria della Vita is a place to contemplate the great emotion felt by women over the death of Christ. The life-sized sculptures by Niccolo dell'Arca in the 15th century are very dramatic, memorable and moving.",
          "visit the \"compianto\" that's unique because is made by painted \"terracotta\", unusual material. Really different from classic statues, it's so modern, a different way to show the sorrow. Please visit also the museum",
          "It is a hidden treasure in the heart of Bologna. Very little church with very nice interior spaces and the unique terracote sculptures. You must see this spot.",
          "We were told about the statues of the four Mary's and Joseph at the tomb of Our Lord by our tour guide - interesting, worth a look.",
          "Close to central square in Bologna, the Church Santa Maria della Vita is yet hidden to many tourists. Its main attraction is the famous sculpture Lamentation over the dead Christ, which is a must when visiting Bologna. It is fascinating to see the realistic features in this",
          "Amazing terracotta full size 15th century statues THE COMPIANTO . Upstairs there is a museum and further life size terracotta works of art. There were also 2 x A4 sheets describing them IN ENGLISH. Out of all the places we visited this was only the second place we went to that",

        "wiki": "The Two Towers (Italian: Le due torri), both of them leaning, are the symbol of Bologna, Italy, and the most prominent of the Towers of Bologna. They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (mura dei torresotti). The taller one is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda. Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited with having been constructed between 1109 and 1119. Their construction was a competition between the two families to show which was the more powerful family. However, the scarcity of documents from this early period makes this in reality rather uncertain. The name of the Asinelli family, for example, is documented for the first time actually only in 1185, almost 70 years after the presumed construction of the tower which is attributed to them.\n\n\n== Asinelli Tower ==\n\nIt is believed that the Asinelli Tower initially had a height of ca. 70 m and was raised only later to the current 97.2 m (with an overhanging battlement of 2.2 m). In the 14th century the city became its owner and used it as a prison and small stronghold. During this period a wooden construction was added around the tower at a height of 30 m above ground, which was connected with an aerial footbridge (later destroyed during a fire in 1398) to the Garisenda Tower. Its addition is attributed to Giovanni Visconti, Duke of Milan, who allegedly wanted to use it to control the turbulent Mercato di Mezzo (today via Rizzoli) and suppress possible revolts. The Visconti had become the rulers of Bologna after the decline of the Signoria of the Pepoli family, but were rather unpopular in the city.\nSevere damage was caused by lightning that often resulted in small fires and collapses, and only in 1824 was a lightning rod installed. The tower survived, however, at least two documented large fires: the first in 1185 was due to arson and the second one in 1398 has already been mentioned above.\nThe Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli (in 1640) and Giovanni Battista Guglielmini (in the following century) for experiments to study the motion of heavy bodies and the earth rotation. In World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: During bombing attacks, four volunteers took post at the top to direct rescue operations to places hit by Allied bombs. Later, a RAI television relay was installed on top. Architect Minoru Yamasaki is thought to have been inspired by the Towers when designing the World Trade Center during the 1960s.\n\n\n== Garisenda Tower ==\nThe Garisenda Tower today has a height of 48 m with an overhang of 3.2 m. Initially it was approximately 60 m high, but had to be lowered in the 14th century due to a yielding of the ground which left it slanting and dangerous. In the early 15th century, the tower was bought by the Arte dei Drappieri, which remained the sole owner until the Garisenda became municipal property at the end of the 19th century.\nIt was cited several times by Dante in the Divine Comedy and The Rime (a confirmation of his stay in Bologna), and by Goethe in his Italian Journey. The Two Towers have also been the subject of an eponymous poem by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci as part of the Barbarian Odes. Charles Dickens wrote about the towers in his Pictures from Italy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "We saw Rick\u2019s Long Weekend in Bologna (now on YouTube) and we\u2019re determined to eat in this market. The fish dishes were amazing and there was a great buzz. The other food meat and cheese platters all looked terrific too.",

Also don\u2019t remember anyone smoking (can\u2019t say if",

          "If you are travelling to Bologna you most certainly have to go to the indoor market. We purchased some amazing meat and bread to take away with us as well as trying some incredible ragu with some local red wine. The food was amazing. It was full of people and had a great",
          "Great little place for wine or cocktails. It's either the first little stall on the left or the last on the right, depending on which door you go in. We just happened upon the market and decided to go in and have a drink. The guys had wine and the ladies wanted something",
          "Tucked in the quadrilatero, this little market has about 10 stalls of fresh food for eating right in the market or taking away for a picnic or back to your residence while vacationing. A wide variety of panini, pastas, and meats are there for the choosing. All the food seems",

          "We hoped to grab a bite here but the place turned out to be quiet small and offering very limited food choices. They had a pasta stand, which I have to admit looked very nice, a bakery store with various sweets, and a restaurant upstairs. We walked around and decided to go eat",
          "Mercato di Mezzo is really nice place to visit. You can try all kinds of Italian food and beverages and feel Italian spirit there. Prices are resonable and cheaper then other places.",
          "The place is cozy and one can find a variety of quite good quick eats. I recommend the salads in the lebanese bistro down stairs and their coffee. Also the seafood plateau. Another plus, there is a public restroom for the clients. Not the cleanest, but still",
          "We popped in several times, mainly to eye up the food but also to use the toilets!! There's a great variety of pasta, sandwiches & cooked dishes. It's not the cheapest but it's not the most expensive, but it's definitely a good option for tourists to try a variety of food with",
          "Myself and husband love this place. It\u2019s got a chilled out atmosphere. The vibe is fab. The pasta is one of the nicest I have ever tasted. We shared the sage butter and the bolognaise. Both were amazing. Finished with an aperol spritz. Will definitely be visiting again.",

          "I'd call this more of a food hall than a market. There were quite a few nice food stands and the place is very modern, but we didn't spend much time there as it was rather packed. We preferred the space outside (in the Quadrilatero district) because it seemed to have a bit more",

          "Like other reviewers found, there are some positives here. The standard of food and drink offerings is fairly good and varied and the venue is well situated. Sadly, it is just too cramped to work in practice. You will struggle to find a seat let alone a table and when you choose",
          "We went in there for lunch and were fortunate to find a table in the little cafe to the side. I ordered tirtelloni in brodo which to be honest was a bit chewy. Certainly not what I would call fresh pasta. The only good thing about this market is that it has a toilet that we used",
          "We stopped at this mini food hall on a number of occasions for a drink, snacks, and some homemade pasta. Everything we had was good, and we found the prices to be reasonable. The only issue is the lack of seating at busy times.",

It stands on the Piazza Maggiore, near the Palazzo Comunale and facing the Basilica of San Petronio. Proving insufficient for the massive participation of the people in the city's government, it was in 1245 flanked by the Palazzo Re Enzo, over which stands the Torre dell'Arengo, whose bell was used to call the people during emergencies.\nThe Palazzo del Podest\u00e0 is a long building, with a large hall on the upper floor. \nThe lower floor is a double open arcade, the so-called Voltone del Podest\u00e0, through which pass two lanes of shops.\nIn 1453 Aristotile Fioravanti replaced the bell and reconstructed the original Gothic fa\u00e7ade in the Renaissance style by order of Giovanni II Bentivoglio. In the Voltone, in 1525, were placed the terracotta statues of the city's protectors, Sts. Petronius, Proculus, Dominic and Francis, all by Alfonso Lombardi.\nIn the 16th-18th centuries the Palazzo was used as theatre. In the 20th century it was frescoed by Adolfo de Carolis.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palazzo del Podest\u00e0 (Bologna) at Wikimedia Commons",

          "This is one of the biggest churches in Bologna. Actually the first I visited in Bologna because it\u2019s near the Central Station. The building is massive. In a church I prefer to light a candle my own candle with a wish but the special church people take in the candles and light",
          "When you are in Bologna and don\u2019t body the cathedral, then it is like you have never been to Bologna . So beautiful and so magical . High ceiling & colourful windows , Defo is a must . Pictures don\u2019t justify the beauty inside and outside . When I was there , there was some",
          "when visiting the clocktower with its easy 44 steps upstairs (but narrow corridor) , you can enjoy the organists playlist",
          "I am not a church friend, albeit I have seen hundreds. All guidebooks think that the majority of travellors want to see the churches. Quite the oposite I think. This is a tipycal church from the 19th century. Boring. Buy guide books that describes the life in the area, now and",
          "Cathedral di San Pietro is just off the main square . I think it is a must see in Bologna . It is just a few blocks from main square and I think rivals the beauty of any Cathedral .",
          "Beautiful sacred place. Quiet and serene. Although it is not as popular as the St Petronius church, it is Bologna's cathedral and the Archbishop's seat.",
          "A beautiful church with a very serene atmosphere, quiet but very lived in, an active church and a wonderful spot for a few minutes of thinking in the midst of the bustling little town of Bologna",
          "Whilst not as 'popular' as San Petronio, this is still worth looking inside and admiring. It is a shame it isn't on a square though.",
          "Start your stay in Bologna here it will give you a great insight into life gone by and its famous people that lived here , a very good layer out museum well worth the visit and the girls on the coat room were charming told us lots of places to go",
          "Worth calling in to add to your Bologna experience, but it\u2019s not one of the best. Interesting if you haven\u2019t seen many Italian places of worship.",
          "The sheer size of the cathedral makes one feel very small but the overall ambience is one of welcome to all. A \u2018must see\u2019 for all visitors to Bologna.",
          "One can judge by the cathedral how reach was this city. Exciting!There are also many prayers in the cathedral not only tourists.",
          "It was nice to visit because it was much quieter than the other churches in the city and no crowds. Interesting artwork.",
          "This monumental church on the main street of Bologna provides a haven of tranquillity in the heart of a busy city. It also provides much for those interested in Baroque architecture which hides it's earlier history (finished in 1184).",
          "San Pietro has so much to offer, so take the time to see as much as possible. The art work on the floor includes marble in unusual colors with intricate designs. On Saturdays only the cripts are available for exploration, as is the tower. Leave yourself plenty of time.",
          "Interesting easy to view Cathedral in bologna. No lines, not many people, so easy to enjoy the interior of the church",
          "This is the Cathedral of Bologna, right on one of the main streets in the heart of Bologna. Simple outside but bright and colorful inside. Some large paintings hang along side walls. Massive with no real transepts.",
          "We passed this church while walking to Piazza Maggiore. Although it didn't look like much from the outside, it was amazing on the inside. Step inside and spend a little time and you won't be disappointed.",
          "This is along the way to the Piazza Maggoire. It looked like an ordinary church from the outside where there are 2 beggers as well. Was pleasantly surprised to see that the church was very well furnished and decorated on the inside. Entrance is free as well.",
          "Visited twice due to the fact my wife had a tee-shirt on and it was pointed out that she would need to cover her shoulders. This is another chapel that is well worth the visit. free entry and only ask for a donation. the chapel tower is only open an a Saturday so did not get to",
          "The guy behind the old wooden table at the entrance to the belltower surely understood when I asked \u201cIs there a lift?\u201d because he smiled and said \u201csi, si, of course\u201d and grabbed our \u20ac5s. I even double-checked by putting on my best Italian accent \u201cascensore???\u201d and he grinned",
          "The original Church was built on this site in 1028 but this was destroyed by fire in 1141. Reconstructed in 1184 & in 1396 a high portico was rebuilt in 1467. Besides the magnicent Cathedral,you go visit a museum underneath where they have preserved the original old foundations",
          "Another day, another fabulous church in Bologna. We wandered in at 7:30am on Saturday and a service was going on. We sat and listened to the mass whilst enjoying the artworks on display Bologna is a city jam packed with great churches to visit & this is one of the best!",
          "It's a very beautiful church. Lots of them in bologna. They have a sculpture depicting peoples reaction when Jesus died. It's unique and a must see",
          "Passing it as we just arrived down the street at the main train station, there were lots of people in dark suits and TV cameras and a huge commotion. Obviously an important religious event was going on. We returned the next day for a quiet look and found it to be very",
          "Yes, Bologna really is full of churches and after a day or two they all merge into each other for me. However this visit was really interesting because we ventured down to the crypt and met the archaeologist, by chance. He was so interesting, showing us the roman foundations,",
          "We visited the cathedral and attended a high mass - the organ is spectacular. It is a beautiful church.",
          "The church is an impressive Cathedrale decorated in the baroque style. One of the unique art pieces is a large terra-cotta sculpture by Alfonso Lombardi - beautiful detail and worth seeking out. The church is also known for the huge bell - \"La Nonna\", which weighs 3300",
          "This is a very beautiful church in Bologna, right in Via D'Independenza. If you happen to walk down that street, you must visit it.",
          "Very interesting and nice church in the heart of Bologna .For me 4th of the greatest churches in Bologna",
          "Another beautiful church including massive columns, painted ceiling, simple and ornate side chapels with a stunning altarpiece.",
          "Again, you always have many religious buildings to see in most Italian cities but this is a splendid example and worth a visit.",
          "We just popped in to this dazzling cathedral as we were ambling down Via Dell'Indipendenza on a Saturday afternoon and so glad we did. A beautiful church with wonderful light and many items of interest. A real gem.",
          "Walked up the bell tower...not as arduous as some as it's circular in places and the steps are long and shallow. But there are steps, lots of them but it's rewarded with a great view over the red city!",
          "I stumbled upon this church while out for a stroll, such a lovely space to wander in and reflect. Worth a visit if you are in the area",
          "This was a nice church but nothing that would set it apart from any of the other ones we saw in Bologna- mainly because it was built in 17th & 18th century. Entrance was free but a man at entrance attempts to charge for entry into catacombs- which there are none. I read about",
          "Don't let the \u20ac5 price and daunting climb stop you! The view from the top is amazing! Perfect location in the old town to see all the beautiful sights in Bologna from above! Totally worth the cost and the extra exercise!",
          "Bell tower worth a climb -views great. Crypts also interesting. Both included in the price but bell tower limited opening - watch out for sign out front of church indicating day and times. 5 euro entry.",
          "The poor review is based on the actions of the man dealing with entry. Unconvinced about paying the 5 euro entry fee, we were tempted by this man with the promise of catacombs. My mum, who had been to Bologna before, was very surprised by this as she didn't know there were any.",
          "In the middle of the city close to the public market suddenly you can see perfect historical building.It 's better decorated than San Petronio one of the famous cathedral in the Bologna.",
          "What a beautiful cathedral. Well worth popping in to view the beautiful artefacts. Would definitely recommend to see.",
          "Beautiful and historic! Definitely a must-see for those who are Christian oriented or historical buffs. Keep in mind that they charge 2 euros for allowing you to take pictures! FYI-",
          "Outside is plain and it is easy just to pass on by. This would be a mistake albeit I would suggest any visit would not need to be lengthy to see the interior. Best to include it as part of any sight seeing tour of historic Bologna.",
          "City centre church well used by Bolognese. Saints day was in full flow with thrones and choirs. So well done.",
          "Well worth see. We thoroughly enjoyed this Cathedral amazing art works we spent a hour or more taking photos.",
          "Did not expect this church to be so huge. Its beautifully designed. There are a some glass floorings so you can see underground. Very peaceful place",
          "Had the opportunity of visiting this cathedral with my son and was TrueType amazed. The decor is beautiful and works of art on display magnificent! There are marble pillars and the walls and ceilings are spectacular. There is also a terracotta sculpture group looking down at",
          "I am not religious at all, but think that the architecture in churches is awesome... and this does not disappoint at all...",
          "Originally was strolling this street to do a little window shopping but am so glad I took the time to visit this Cathedral. It's position on a busy modern street does not prepare you for the immensity you encounter once inside",
          "Not to be missed. I enjoyed the thinking at the back of the Bologna Meridian line. A strange scientific exercise in the middle of a Cathedral There is a most interesting chapel containing really impressive paintings of Dante's Inferno.",
          "Really beautiful inside, very ornate decoration with traditional renaissance painting on the high chapel ceiling. The trip down to the crypt is interesting and peaceful. Now begin your journey to the top of the tower. Don't give up, keep going, it's well worth the climb. On",
          "I love coming to Bologna because it seems more of a true Italian city and less a tourist destination. The past two times I've been here, there have been ceremonies at the Cathedral and I have been able to join the congregation. I like it from a historical and a religious",
          "Beautiful, peaceful, serene, spiritual. Lovely to spend half an hour recharging the batteries in wonderful surroundings.",
          "After seeing so many beautiful catholic churches, they start to become similar, but every once in a while, there is one that stands out and seems to have a different charm and beauty: this is certainly one of the special ones!",
          "Situated on the main street it is close to the city centre. To miss it would be a pity as it is very lovely.",
          "The cathedral doesn't look extraordinary (well, in comparison with other buildings from Bologna). However, once inside, you're overwhelmed.. a massive and beautiful place, with lots of interesting things to see. You can also visit the underground galleries. A must see!",
          "Visited here during a recent business trip. From the outside you don't expect much, but inside the scale and beauty of the cathedral takes your breath away. A great place to visit and recharge your spiritual battery.",
          "Most of the Building dates to the 17th century and the facade remains only partially complete. However, this is a massive church and was destined to be one of the largest until the project was stopped. Don't miss the meridian located in the floor of the church.",
          "every corner is different and very way you look you feel that you are watched over lovingly. a must see when visiting Bologna.",
          "beautiful cathedral , mass was full over 1500 people service was intense but relaxing all ages taking part a must visit to this beautiful cathedral",
          "I'm still under the influence of this cathedra - what's more, in my opinion it's a few times more interesting than the one on the Piazza Maggiore. Must see, even if you're not particularly interested in the churches architecture. But be careful, it's quiet ease to pass by on the",
          "Cattedrale San Pietro is a special church because it is not situated near a square but it was built between two regular houses. It is almost impossible to take a picture of from outside it including the whole thing.",
          "I am surprised by how people sing the praises of this cathedral. It's very nice, though the outside is disappointing, as the building is wedged between other commercial buildings with no grounds. You have to visit it when it Bologna but there are more interesting churches in the",
          "It is situated in the midst of the upmarket retail centre of Bologna but as soon as you enter its portals, a sense of beauty and peace transcends one. I really recommend any one treading the porticos of Bologna to rest a while in this sanctuary of religious calm and majesty to",
          "Do not miss this one.A lovely church,with a lovely feel.The sculptured terracotta figures were beautifully done.Well worth the visit",
          "The cathedral is one of the best i have visited and id is well worth the visit it is absolutely beautiful inside and very close to the center of the town and the people are very helpful too i would visit again to see more things in bologna",
          "We stopped in one evening after hearing organ music as we passed by. A lovely recital was in progress, and walking through the church was even more special because of it. Many beautiful paintings and sculptures are housed in this Cathedral. There is also a museum which",
          "This church belongs to the Curia - it is attached to a secondary building belonging to the church. Whilst not as impressive as its larger cousin Saint Petrono - it still an impressive church with baroque style giving it grandeur. The building dates from the 16-17th century. The",
          "By chance we, two mature couples, were walking past the Cathedral late on Saturday evening when we heard organ music coming from inside the building. The music was magnificent. We do not know if this was a normal Saturday night activity; if the organist was practicing or what,",
          "A beautiful church, quite unassuming from an external view, but stunning inside. Take time from the busy shopping street outside to sit and reflect in it's cool surroundings. We visited during the early evening and sat to listen to a wonderful organist playing a varied selection",
          "beautiful building inside and out visited here quite a few times due to the rain showers! and there is no charge so a bonus!",
          "Whilst I was in Bologna I managed to get time to pop into the Cattedrale di San Pietro (to be fair it was literally across the road from my hotel) on the recommendation of one of my colleagues. I am not religious but I can appreciate great architecture and art and this provided",
          "what an extraordinary space - well worth paying for a bit more info so you can make the most of the astronomical info they have across the floor but what I spent my time doing was wondering what on erath it would feel like for someone coming at it across the fields back in the",
          "The bland exterior of the building (just a short way up the right hand side of the Via dell\u2019Indipendenza from Piazza Maggiore) belies the baroque and imposing majestic interior. Due to the lack of local marble there is a group of terracotta figures depicting the dead Christ and",
          "At first glance, you wonder why this church is not \"finished\", once you take the tour, you find out the church held the purse strings and did not want this building to be bigger or better than St. Peters in Rome. This adds to the charm of the space. The sun dial is not to be",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have visited in Italy. It may not be as grand in terms of sheer size but the frescos on the ceiling above the altar are stunning. We passed by late on a Saturday evening and the main door was wide open giving a sview that literally",
          "This cathedral is easy to miss, on the right, near the start of Via dell'indipendenza as you go down hill. An uninspiring entrance but the inside is very impressive. Well worth looking for.",
          "This has to be one of the most impressive buildings for architecture, sculpture and artwork . Not to mention the shear scale of the place. It's enormous. Visited on a Saturday, a service was in progress, no charges or restrictions to take photos or videos. Lovely experience.",
          "The Cathedral was peaceful and calm and makes the mind feel tranquil yet the security checks to enter it was bit troublesome including its restrictions to take photos inside the cathedral.",
          "A mammoth church cut short during construction - see the truncated arch on the East side. Full of Gothicry and frescoes. Why the upper half of the facade came away, I don't know - maybe it was never there. Anyway I quite like the brick key. Note the Church is the wrong way",
          "One of the many impressive churches in the old city and well worth stopping in to see the art and windows.",
          "I saw a large door on a busy street which caught my attention (the architecture in Bologna is so beautiful that even communal entrances to apartment buildings are beautiful!). It turned out to be the door to Cattedrale di San Pietro, which catches you by surprise as it's not",
          "This Cattedrale is in a very busy road, we did not expect to find this amazing house of worship here. Once again it a must to see, and admire the perfection of this Cattedrale, the excavation is still going on and there are places where it can be seen and admired.",
          "Was very disappointed as our hotel recommended it Only huge and baroque ( I don't like baroque). Nice organ.",
          "The cathedral is a mix of architectural styles, which makes a visit interesting to begin with. The combined effect is conducive to prayer and silent reflection, which is always important for a church.",
          "the church in my opinion is ugly, uninteresting with the exeption of the Alfonso Lombardi, Compianto su Cristo morto (early 16th century)",
          "Quaint church in the very heart of Bologna. Entrance is free, many paintings and historical features.",
          "A beautiful gem, this church is easily only a few steps from the town centre in via dell'Indipendenza. the church itself is beautiful, and on a clear day it's absolutely worth a climb up the belltower, from where you can get a beautiful view of the city and surrounding",
          "This is beautiful inside and out. Very unusual building from the outside. The inside is lovely with a few displays. You have to pay to take photos but I think it was about \u20ac2 which goes towards the restoration. It is located in piazza maggiore and well worth a visit.",
          "just off the main drag in central city this church is a place of quiet prayer and meditation. While we were there the organist was playing the great organ which added to the atmosphere.",
          "Enjoyed a quiet moment in the main sanctuary of the St Peter Cathedral. Every chapel beside each other has a history to tell. Beside the main altar is a wooden doorway leading to the crypt where restoration work on the remnants of yesteryear continues amid our tour. The crypt",
          "It's a pretty church and worth popping in. You can walk up to the roof too. Didn't stay long but it was nice to see for a few minutes.",
          "This is still a very active church, but on a major thoroughfare, so it's an interesting mix of people. But the statuary is amazing and the quality of the light is entrancing. It's definitely a wonderful moment of peace in a hectic city.",
          "I was lucky to be in Bologna on a weekend and the bell tower was open. As long as you are comfortable in a narrow space, the climb to the top is not too arduous and the view over the roof tops is stunning. There are different levels near the top where you can stop to admire the",
          "I never get fed up of looking in old cathedrals or churches, this one is not much to look at from the outside, but a lovely place to visit. Wander around and escape the heat of summer.",
          "The front of this Cathedral is quite plain and the doors are very plain wood. Unless you actually think about it, you could just walk past and not realise it was there. Being a Cathedral, it is sumptuously decorated and lovely to behold. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This cathedral is absolutely amazing! Make sure you ask to visit the crypt, the excavations are ongoing, and just being there is like taking part in an Indiana Jones-like adventure.",
          "Overshadowed by the Basilica of San Petronio but well worth visiting. A grand and beautiful but not over-ornate Baroque church just off the main square.",
          "Free entry but you need to pay if you want to visit the more special/important side chapels. Check opening times as closed over lunchtime & early afternoon. Loved the sundial/sun calendar which was the first we'd seen",
          "It is the main church of Bologna - however there is still an ongoing discussion, whether the Basilica di San Pietro is more important or not. A lot of art work in the huge church, it it worth to visit.",
          "Great church. We visited a few times. On Saturday evening the bell tower is open along with the crypt. Well worth the \u20ac5 donation. The walk inside of the bell is on circular walk no steps or ladders. Great view over Bologna at night.",
          "The cathedral was undeniably beautiful and well worth a visit. Unfortunately however it had a very unwelcoming vibe to it. Obviously the cathedral is first & foremost a religious site rather than a tourist attraction but there didn't even seem to be a feeling of spirituality to",
          "We were lucky enough to walk past it last night when it is truly magical. A young man was playing the organ which added to the atmosphere. I'm not into looking at churches but the inside was beautiful in the candlelight.",
          "There are so many building like this in Italy and this one stand out. a lot of of treasure are hidden therein..Your visit to Italy is incomplete if you don't go there to see for yourself. Go and see so as to appreciate what the ancient architect has done in Italy.",
          "Like so many churches in Italy you can't get around it. Just go inside and see for yourself. Every church has hidden treasures...",
          "Large, roomy but, at least in our opinion, lacking soul. Nice statues, good lighting but missing the charisma of many other churches in this beautiful town.",
          "While not as popular as St. Petronilius in Piazza Maggiore, the Cathedral is quieter and very much worth a visit. A guidebook would be helpful.",
          "Lovely church and well worth a visit when you are here in Bologna One of many but a visit here misses the crowds and there is lots to see and interpret in any church",
          "Magnificent church in the city centre in Bologna. Walking inside is mind blowing. Everywhere you look is truly beautiful.",
          "Compared to San Petronio, the Bologna cathedral lacks style and beauty. Have a quick look on your way to San Petronio and spent your time there.",
          "Not the most interesting church of Bologna. Nevertheles people of Bologna seem to prefer this church for their worship. Quite a lot of people attended the mass and were buying prayer cards from special men who walked around in chruch during the service. The church has some",
          "Worth seeing as part of visit to Bologna. Easy reach of other main sights. High ceilings and impressive dome",
          "Pretty interesting church Its scale is quite amazing In very good condition Very big on the inside which adds to the experience Worth a quick visit",
          "A very beautiful church with good proportions and decorations. Very restful and serene with wonderful carvings around the building by Boldini and other artists. Really good.",
          "-Very beautiful cathedral. The interior is spectacular with lots of artwork, statues and beautiful collection. . - Of course Italy has many such beautiful and magnificent cathedrals and this is one among such beautiful ones. I will certainly say this is one among the must see",
          "The church is massive and like most churches in Italy adorned with priceless carvings, statues and artwork. Well worth seeing or attending mass in there.",
          "There are many fine churches in Italy and this one is both large and impressively decorated. We found the massive columns particularly notable and it's much quieter than counterparts in Florence.",
          "The cathedral ''San Pietro'' is located alongside the central pedestrian street Via Independenza, the most crowded road of the city. Can not take a photo of the facade because it placed in the narrow road where it is literally too attached to the buildings in front of it.",
          "A magnificent structure right in the heart of the city . Definitely a \"must see\" site ! Beautiful works of art throughout the cathedral and a tourist destination - yet still retains the elements of a place of worship",
          "On the major shopping street of Indipendencia, this is a beautiful church of fine dimensions, a treasure house of art. Reccommed the 10 o'clock mass on Sunday. We were treated to no less than two cardinals celebrating, archbishop Caffara and archbishop emeritus Biffi, and very",
          "There is very little from the outside to let the visitor know that this church has a wonderful interior. The Pieta by Lombardi is a tour de force",
          "There are a lot of churches all over Bologna and Italy. This one is beautiful, and the life-sized sculpture of the death of Christ is phenomenal. Stop by if you have a chance.",
          "This place was worth the visit. We had a great time walking around the area for hours. Take a couple hours and discover this area, you won't be sorry.",
          "It's hard to walk more then 500 meters in Iatly without finding a curch. On my walking tour in Blogna, this was the first one got in my way, walked in, prayed and admired the interior of this majestuos catedral.",
          "We just wandered into the Cattedrale by accident on the evening we arrived. There was an organ concert in progress even though it was quite late. Beautiful! There are a number of important works and some impressive trompe l'oeil.",
          "Worth seeing for its sheer scale. Fantastic on Saturday night before 10pm mass when the large main doors are flung open to reveal the illuminated interior.",
          "You think its not that large, but when you enter, you are surprised by the big cathedral. Its main alter and architecture is very nice and well kept, despite being quite old. If you are lucky enough, pay a visit to the cathedral's treasury as it contains very interesting and of",
          "Ancient cathedral built over the previous church that was destroyed in the XII century. Most important thing to see is the \"Compianto su Cristo morto\" (early 16th century) by Alfonso Lombardi (not to be confused with the other \"Compianto\" by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca located in the",
          "The shuttle from the airport stops virtually in front of this Cathedral. So I ventured in with luggage. It is very impressive. And people often give directions that it is just past San Pedro. So helpful to know where this is",
          "A few feet away from the fashion shops and their blaring radios, the cathedral is an oasis of silence. It displays many antique statues and frescoes as well as wonderful architectural features. Mass is still held every day, and there are areas reserved for prayers.",
          "The locals tell me that this is not the seat of the Bishop. It is also not built on a cruciferous plan. That not withstanding, it is a wonderful baroque structure. Photos are OK. Happened to be there when the organist was practicing. A beautiful instrument.",
          "When we visited it was full of very enthusiastic worshippers so we were able to see just how seriously this wonderful huge cathedral is in use Lots of beautiful marble and side chapels",
          "This is on the way to the main piazza, so there's simply no reason to miss it. The facade is uninteresting, and the inside is less glitzy than many Italian cathedrals, but it still is quite beautiful. It is certainly worth seeing if you are in Bologna.",
          "The Cattedrale was centrally situated but like a lot of Bologna suffered from beggars on its doorstep. Interesting inside, boring facade.",
          "On a Sunday morning we attended a worship service at San Pietro. The beauty of the room, the wonderful music, and the Latin mass combined to make an unforgettable worship experience.",
          "This was so impressive...walking down the street with all the latest shop and then!!! You see this huge front (not like all the other churches) and then you walking into this huge church.",
          "We were walking around town and I poked my head inside the door to see what it was. Wow, we went in and were amazed at its beauty. It's worth a visit and you can take your time when there is no service going on. I'm so envious of the reviewer that got to hear the organ.",
          "Unable to visit last year due to earthquake, this time we were priviledged to visit during a ceremony to celebrate a special mass. This cathedral is very 'understated' compared to the usual.Because of this, one can take more in and appreciate all. The beautiful ceilling, and",
          "This is quite a large church with artistic and colorful detail inside and an attractive facade on the front highlighted by numerous mouldings. It was really a pleasure to visit, maybe our favorite church of Bologna. As a bonus, on the evening we went the \"treasury\" was open to",
          "San Pietro was open for a late night viewing after dinner one evening. The lighting and organ recital made for a really exciting fun experience. The alters were very dramatically lit, an organist played beautiful liturgical music & there was a free entrance to their museum. The",

The two most prominent ones, known as the Two Towers, are the landmark of the city. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the 12th and the 13th century, the number of towers in the city was very high, possibly up to 180. The reasons for the construction of so many towers are not clear. One hypothesis is that the richest families used them for offensive/defensive purposes during the period of the Investiture Controversy.\nBesides the towers, one can still see some fortified gateways (torresotti) that correspond to the gates of the 12th-century city wall (Mura dei torresotti or Cerchia dei Mille), which itself has been almost completely destroyed.\nDuring the 13th century, many towers were taken down or demolished, and others simply collapsed. Many towers have subsequently been utilized in one way or the other: as prison, city tower, shop or residential building. The last demolitions took place during the 20th century, according to an ambitious, but retrospectively unfortunate, restructuring plan for the city. The Artenisi Tower and the Riccadonna Tower at the Mercato di mezzo were demolished in 1917.\nOf the numerous towers originally present, fewer than twenty can still be seen today. Among the remaining ones are the Azzoguidi Tower, also called Altabella (with a height of 61 m), the Prendiparte Tower, called Coronata (60 m), the Scappi Tower (39 m), Uguzzoni Tower (32 m), Guidozagni Tower, Galluzzi Tower, and the famous Two Towers: the Asinelli Tower (97 m) and the Garisenda Tower (48 m).\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe construction of the towers was quite onerous, the usage of serfs notwithstanding. To build a typical tower with a height of 60 m would have required between three and ten years of work.\nEach tower had a square cross-section with foundations between five and ten meters deep, reinforced by poles hammered into the ground and covered with pebble and lime. The tower's base was made of big blocks of selenite stone. The remaining walls became successively thinner and lighter the higher the structure was raised, and were realised in so-called \"a sacco\" masonry: with a thick inner wall and a thinner outer wall, with the gap being filled with stones and mortar.\nUsually, some holes were left in the outer wall as well as bigger hollows in the selenite to support scaffoldings and to allow for later coverings and constructions, generally on the basis of wood.\n\n\n== Number ==\nThe towers must actually have crowded Bologna in the Middle Ages and there has been considerable debate about their peak number before the first ones were demolished to avoid collapse or for  other reasons.\nThe first historian to study the towers of Bologna in a systematic way was Count Giovanni Gozzadini, a senator of the Italian kingdom in the 19th century, who studied the city's history intensively, not least to raise the prestige of his home town in the context of the now united Italy. He based his analysis mostly on the civic archives of real estate deeds, attempting to arrive at a reliable number of towers on the basis of documented ownership changes. His approach resulted in the extraordinary number of 180 towers, an enormous amount considering the size and resources of medieval Bologna.\nMore recent studies pointed out that Gozzadini's methodology might have led to multiple counts of buildings, which could have been referred to in legal documents by different names, depending on the name of the family who actually owned it at a given moment. More recent estimates reduced therefore the number to a total between 80 and 100, where not all towers existed at the same time.\n\n\n== Two Towers ==\n\nThey are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (mura dei torresotti). It was located at the site of the early medieval Gate to the Via Emilia, the Porta Ravennate, now remembered by the name of the adjacent Piazza di Porta Ravegnana. The taller tower is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda.\n\n\n== List of the still existing towers and gateways ==\n\n\n=== Towers ===\nAccursi Tower (Torre Accursi or Torre dell'orologio) - P.zza Maggiore\nAgresti Tower (Torre Agresti) - P.zza Galileo\nAlberici Tower (Torre Alberici) - Via S.

        "wiki": "The Pepoli are an aristocratic banking family of Bologna, in northern Italy. They were lords of the city for thirteen years in the fourteenth century.\nA branch of the family moved to Trapani in Sicily and were granted several feudal lordships and baronies.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe presence of the family in Bologna seems to have been documented since the last decade of the eleventh century. The testament of Romeo Pepoli's Zerra, written by Rolandino de 'Passaggeri on 8 October 1251, shows the presence of the family in the area of via Castiglione at that time. From the beginning, the Pepoli had established a prominent banking house in Bologna and became among the richest families in Italy at that time. For this reason, the chessboard used to count the relationship between different coins was adopted as the family's coat of arms. After years of private financial activity, the family eventually took a leading role in the political scene of the city.\n\n\n=== Lordship of Bologna ===\nThe House of Pepoli reached its apogee in the first half of the 14th century. The family took power as Lords of Bologna during the chaotic struggles between Guelfs and Ghibellines in the city. In August, 1337, Taddeo Pepoli orchestrated an armed occupation of the city and gained support for his election as Lord of Bologna. While initially reluctant to acknowledge Pepoli, Pope Benedict XII sent the bishop of Como, a Parravicini, to the city. The papal nuncio delivered  the keys of the city to Taddeo, appointing him papal vicar for a three-year term. With this title Taddeo obtained the legitimacy to his office. These episodes are commemorated in two ovals frescoed in the 17th century by Canuti in the stairwell entrance of the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande, across the street from the Palazzo Pepoli Vecchio.\nTheir seat in the city was Palazzo Pepoli Vecchio, constructed by Taddeo Pepoli. The Pepoli maintained dynastic alliances through well-considered marriages: Obizzo III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, married Jacopa Pepoli in 1317 and the condottiero Roberto Alidosi, papal vicar and lord of Imola, was given Giacoma Pepoli. The commune of Castiglione dei Pepoli in the Italian Province of Bologna still bears the family's name.\n\n\n=== 15th and 16th Centuries ===\nAfter the rule of Taddeo Pepoli (1337-1347), Bologna fell to the Visconti of Milan. While Cardinal Gil de Albornoz forcibly returned the city to the papal orbit in 1360, the Pepoli never regained their former civic power.\nThe family remained prominent landowners. Guido Pepoli  was ordained cardinal by Pope Sixtus V in 1589. The imposing Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande was commissioned in 1653 by the newly minted Senator Odoardo Pepoli; the architects were Giovanni Battista Alberoni and Giuseppe Antonio Torri. Today it houses the Baroque works once in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna.\nA later member of the family, conte Carlo Pepoli, wrote Vincenzo Bellini's libretto for I Puritani and provided the lyrics for Rossini's song \"La Danza\". To him Giacomo Leopardi dedicated one of his canti.\n\n\n=== House of Bonaparte ===\nNapoleone Gioacchino Pepoli was a senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Mayor of Bologna, and Italian envoy to Russia. Moreover, he was also a grand-nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte through his mother, Princess Louisa Julie Caroline Murat the daughter of Prince Joachim Murat - Napoleon's brother-in-law.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

There's lots to look at, and the English audio guide gives a nice amount of information so you can get through it in a reasonable time (I skipped a handful of rooms and was out in an hour). Really helps you appreciate what you're seeing as you walk around the city.",

        "wiki": "The Palazzo Poggi is a palazzo in Via Zamboni 33, Bologna, Italy. \nIt is the headquarters of the University of Bologna and of the rector of the university.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Palazzo Poggi was built as the home of Alessandro Poggi and his brother the future Cardinal Giovanni Poggio.\nThe building was erected between 1549 and 1560. \nThe design of the  Palazzo Poggi has been attributed to Bartolomeo Triachini.\nHe was apparently given the commission for the Palazzo Poggi by the Bishop Giovanni Poggi shortly before he was elevated to Cardinal.\nOther sources attribute the design of the Palazzo Poggi to Pellegrino Tibaldi.\nCardinal Poggi met Pellegrino Tibaldi after the painter moved to Rome in 1547, and later commissioned him to paint the Palazzo Poggi.\nTibaldi, a native of Bologna, returned to the city in 1555 and painted frescos for the Cardinal in the palace and the family chapel. \nThe frescoes are considered Tibaldi's masterpiece.In 1714 the Palazzo Poggi became the House of the Instituto dell Scienze of Bologna.\nThe Institute of Sciences was founded by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili.\nThe Tower Observatory (La Specola) was built between 1712 and 1725.\nThe library was built in 1744 following designs by Giuseppe Antonio Torri and Carlo Francesco Dotti.\nThe collection of images was begun in 1754.\nThe monumental Great Hall of the institute was added to the north side of the palace in the eighteenth century, opened in 1756. \nThe Institute of Science was a model learning establishment in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment and a key part of the University of Bologna.\nIt enjoyed the protection of the Bolognese Pope Pope Benedict XIV (Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini).\nDuring the Napoleonic period, scientific equipment from the Institute was dispersed among different faculties (anatomy, optics, chemistry, geography, nautical science, physics, astronomy) and the historical collections were scattered in various museums. Only the library remained in the Palazzo Poggi, to form the nucleus of the future university library.\nThe Palazzo is now one of the main buildings of the University of Bologna.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, a cultural project was promoted by the University to return and gather the dispersed collections back to their historic home.\n\n\n== Layout and usage ==\nThe current appearance of the Palazzo Poggi, with a large courtyard with loggia and a large staircase to the piano nobile is due to the interventions by Cardinal Giovanni Poggi. \nThe palace has fresco decorations mainly from the Mannerist and early-Baroque periods, the works include:\nRooms of Moses, David, and camerino of the Sphinxes by Prospero Fontana\nRooms of Susana and of the Zodiac by Pellegrino Tibaldi\nRooms of Camilla, Landscapes, the concert hall with Labors of Hercules, and of Winemaking Putti by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Abbate\nRooms of Grotteschi and Telemons by Fontana, Nosadella and Ercole Procaccini the Elder.On the ground floor there is a hall dedicated to the poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci, the Aula Carducci, \nin which the poet gave lectures on the Italian language and literature for 40 years.\nAlso on the ground floor there is the Hercules Room, holding a statue of the mythological hero sculpted by Angelo Pi\u00f2 in 1730. \nThe palace also houses various university museums, the university rectorate, the Bologna University Library and the picture gallery, with over 600 fine portraits.\n\n\n== Museum collections ==\nNatural history\nUlisse Aldrovandi Museum\nCollections of Luigi Ferdinando Marsili\nDiluvian Museum of the Institute of Science\nAnatomy and obstetrics\nObstetrics School\nAnatomical wax models of Ercole Lelli\nAnatomical wax models of Giovanni Manzolini and Anna Morandi Manzolini.\nThe Venerina of Clemente Susini\nPhysics and chemistry\nLight and optics\nElectricity\nGeography room\nMilitary Architecture\nLibrary of the Institute of Science\nGallery of ships\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nMeuS Museo europeo degli Studenti",

          "While the Museo is rather small, the exhibits give you a nice overview of the early medical studies of the human body. The other artifacts on display are things explorers brought back from their journies.",
          "Unsurprisingly, the oldest university in Europe has a fine collection of historical items in a historic building. Particularly interesting to medical, nautical or cartography enthusiasts. You also get something of the university area around. The library and old operating",

Great variety of displays spanning natural history, art, anatomy, military and map history. Personal highlight was the obstetrics room- odd on the face of it but absolutely",
          "Apart of one of the university's buildings, this museum surprisingly has a variety of exhibits and sculptures regarding different subjects. My personal favorites were the human anatomy and birth exhibits, along with the natural history section. Oh, and the ticket is also good",

        "wiki": "The basilica of Santo Stefano (Italian: Basilica di Santo Stefano) encompasses a complex of religious edifices in the city of Bologna, Italy.  Located on Piazza Santo Stefano, it is locally known as Sette Chiese (\"Seven Churches\") and Santa Gerusalemme (\"Holy Jerusalem\"). It has the dignity of minor basilica.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to tradition Saint Petronius, a bishop of the city during the 5th century, built the basilica over a temple of the goddess Isis. The saint wished to have a building that recalled the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nThe different parts of the complex include:\n\nChurch of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crucifix (8th century, presbytery reshaped in 17th century), with the Crypt\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre (according to tradition: 5th century)\nChurch of the Saints Vitale and Agricola (4th century, rebuilt first in the 12th century)\nCourtyard of Pilate (\"Santo Giardino\", 13th century)\nChurch of the Trinity or of the Martyrium (13th century)\nChapel of the Bandage (\"Cappella della Benda\") dedicated to the strip of cloth worn around the head  by the Virgin Mary  as a sign of mourning.\nPilate's Courtyard recalls the lithostrotos, where Jesus was condemned; it leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In the center, a basin called the \"Catino di Pilato\", a Lombard work from 737-744, bears the following inscription:\nUMILIB(US) VOTA SUSCIPE D(OMI)NE D(OM)N(ORUM) N(OST)R(ORUM) LIUTPRAN(TE) ILPRAN(TE) REGIB(US) ET D(OMI)N(O) BARBATU EPISC(OPO) S(AN)C(TE) HECCL(ESIE) B(O)N(ONIEN)S(I)S. HIC I(N) H(ONOREM) R(ELIGIOSI) SUA PRAECEPTA OBTULERUNT, UNDE HUNC VAS IMPLEATUR IN CENAM D(OMI)NI SALVAT(ORI)S, ET SI QUA MUN(ER)A C(UISQUAM) MINUERIT, D(EU)S REQ(UIRET)\nUnder the portico at the center of a window on a column, a 14th-century sculpted rooster, called the Rooster of St Peter, recalls the biblical story of Saint Peter's denial.\n\n\n== Church of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crucifix ==\nThe church of the Crucifix is of Lombard origin and dates back to the 8th century: it consists of a single nave with a trussed vault and a raised presbytery on the crypt. In the nave, on the left, there is the XVIII century statuary complex of the Compianto sul Cristo morto by Angelo Gabriello Pi\u00f2 [3]. At the center of the presbytery, remodeled in the seventeenth century, which is accessed via a staircase, is the Crucifix, the work of Simone dei Crocifissi dating back to about 1380. On the walls there are 15th century frescoes with the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen.\nUnder the presbytery there is the crypt divided into five naves with columns of different invoice, one of which, according to legend, from the base to the capital is perfectly equivalent to Jesus (about one meter and seventy, very high for the time); at the end of it, in two urns placed on an altar, the remains of the Saints Vitale and Agricola are kept. On the sides of the altar, a few years ago, two 16th century frescoes were found under a layer of plaster, illustrating the martyrdom of Vitale and Agricola. In the left aisle, at the back near the altar, there is a small fresco of the early fifteenth century, the so-called Madonna della Neve, perhaps of Lippo di Dalmasio. An object of lesser artistic value but of some suggestion is the white statue of the Madonna Bambina, at the beginning of the crypt, on the right wall.\n\n\n== Church of the Holy Sepulchre ==\n\nThe church dates back to the fifth century, built by the bishop Petronius as a simulacrum of the Constantinian Sepulcher of Jerusalem and rebuilt at the beginning of the eleventh century by Benedictine monks after it was heavily damaged during the devastating 10th century Hungarian invasions. The building, with a central plan, is built on a perimeter with an irregular octagonal base in the center of which a dodecagonal dome is erected. Inside there are 12 columns of marble and brick, while in the center there is a shrine that housed the relics of San Petronio, found here in 1141. The door of the Sepulcher is opened one week a year, after the celebration of mass midnight Easter, in the presence of the Knights of the Holy Sepulcher.\nIn ancient times it was possible to crawl inside to venerate the remains of the saint; the prostitutes of Bologna, on Easter morning, moreover, in memory of Mary Magdalene, went there to pronounce, before the Holy Sepulcher, a prayer whose content they themselves never wanted to reveal. Still according to another ancient tradition, pregnant women in Bologna used to walk thirty-three times (one for each year of the Savior's life) around the Sepulcher, entering each lap in the tomb to pray; at the end of the thirty-third lap, the women then went to the nearby church of the Martyrium to pray before the fresco of the pregnant Madonna. Today the body of St. Petronius is no longer in this church, after which in the year 2000 Cardinal Giacomo Biffi had it moved to the Basilica of San Petronio, which already guarded the head of the patron saint of the city.\n\nIn the church there is also a water source which, in the symbolism of the Stefan complex based on the passion of Christ, is identified with the waters of the Jordan, and which from the archaeological point of view refers to the sacred source of the pre-existing isiac complex. Probably the temple of Isis was in this area, as it seems demonstrated, as well as by the presence of the source (the cult of the Egyptian goddess required the presence of a source of spring water), the persistence of seven Greek marble columns, coming from the city of Karistos (according to surveys made by the University of Geology of Padua), certainly from the Roman period; they have been reused, as you can clearly see, since the seven Roman columns, still standing, were flanked in the Middle Ages by as many brick columns, while where Roman columns were missing, destroyed by the Hungarians raids, new columns were built more robust.\nA column of black cipollino marble, of African origin and of the Roman era (also certainly reused from a previous building), offset from the others, symbolizes the column where Christ was scourged and, as stated in a scroll, guaranteed 200 years of indulgence to each and every time you visit this place.\nThe vault and the walls of the church originally had frescoes with biblical scenes created by Marco Berlinghieri (son of Berlinghiero Berlinghieri) in the mid-thirteenth century, almost entirely eliminated in 1804 to be replaced by new frescoes in Baroque style made by Filippo Pedrini, in turn eliminated by subsequent restorations of the late nineteenth century; what remains of the original thirteenth-century frescoes (a scene representing the Strage of the Innocents) is visible in the basilica museum.\n\n\n== Church of the Saints Vitale and Agricola ==\n\nIt is the oldest of the complex. This basilica-shaped church, without a transept, with a salient fa\u00e7ade and triconca apse, is dedicated to the patron saints Vitale and Agricola and since its construction it housed the relics of the two saints, respectively servant and master, the first two martyrs from Bologna times of Diocletian (305 AD). In 393 the remains are moved from Ambrogio to be taken to Milan (a fact that testifies that the basilica was already built) and also in the fifth century a messenger was sent by Namazio, bishop of Clermont, to have relics of the Bolognese protomartyrs.\nAt the beginning of the XV century a paleochristian sepulcher with the inscription \"Symon\" had been found and the rumor had spread that it was the tomb of Simon Peter, that is of Saint Peter. This news, devoid of any historical foundation, had attracted many pilgrims, distracting them from Rome, the classic destination of pilgrimage. The pope, Pope Eugene IV, then reacted vehemently: he made the church open, he had it filled with earth and left it in this state for about seventy years. Subsequently, through the intercession of the archbishop Giuliano Della Rovere, the church was restored and reopened for worship. An inscription on the side door recalls the event: \"JUL. CARD. S. P. AD VINC. RESTITUIT\". Inside the church there are some interesting finds: remains of Roman mosaic floor, visible through a glass. Then, in the two side apses, two early medieval sarcophagi attributed to Vitale and Agricola, with figures of animals (lions, deer and peacocks) in a raised relief. In the right aisle, on the wall, a cross is identified as that of the torture of St. Agila (in reality it dates back to a later period). The main altar, made up of a turned pagan altar, is set against the back wall (according to the pre-conciliar liturgy, when the celebrant gave his back to the faithful during the celebrations).\n\n\n== Courtyard of Pilate ==\n\nAt the Cortile di Pilato, so called to commemorate the lithostrotos, the place where Jesus was condemned, is accessed by exiting the church of the Sepulcher. The courtyard is bordered to the north and south by two porticoes in Romanesque style with characteristic cruciform columns in brick and brings to the center a limestone basin resting on a pedestal (more recent, 16th century) the so-called \"Pilato's Cat\" : this basin is a Longobard work dating back to 737-744 and bears an inscription under the edge of which is reported the most accredited transcription:\n\u00ab + UMILIB(US) VOTA SUSCIPE D(OMI)NE D(OM)N(ORUM) N(OST)R(ORUM) LIUTPRAN(TE) ILPRAN(TE) REGIB(US) ET D(OM)N(O) BARBATU EPISC(OPO) S(AN)C(TE) HECCL(ESIE) B(O)N(ONIEN)S(I)S. HIC I(N) H(ONOREM) R(ELIGIOSI) SUA PRAECEPTA OBTULERUNT, UNDE HUNC VAS IMPLEATUR IN CENAM D(OMI)NI SALVAT(ORI)S, ET SI QUA MUN(ER)A C(UISQUAM) MINUERIT, D(EU)S REQ(UIRET) \u00bb\nUnder the portico, in the center of a window, on a column, there is a stone rooster dating back to the fourteenth century, called \"Gallo di S. Pietro\" to remember the evangelical episode of the denial of Jesus. Always under the portico is It is possible to observe some mortuary tombstones including one, with a pair of real scissors in the center, belonging to a tailor. Significant for the symbolism of the passion of Christ is that the distance between this courtyard and the nearby church of San Giovanni in Monte (so called because it stands on the only natural protuberance of the central dish of Bologna) would be the same that there is in Jerusalem between the Holy Sepulcher and Calvary.\n\n\n== Church of the Trinity or of the Martyrium ==\nAlso called the Church of the Holy Cross or of Calvary or Trinity. Originally it had to be built in the form of a basilica with 5 naves, with an apse in front of the holy garden (Pilato's courtyard) and the fa\u00e7ade to the east, exactly as it was originally the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem wanted by Constantino. Probably due to lack of funds, Petronius could not complete the building that remained unfinished. Later, with the advent of the Lombards, it would become a Baptistery. At the beginning of a thousand, during the reconstructions made by the Benedictines, there were several uncertainties about how to finish the work, considering that the original Holy Sepulcher had been heavily altered and in those years the Fatimite Caliph al-Hakim was working its destruction . So having lost the historical references of what it was originally, the Benedictines could not complete it. After the late nineteenth-century renovations, currently it is divided into 5 naves, with the fa\u00e7ade facing the courtyard and the apse facing east, both built in neo-Romanesque style on the model of the Holy Sepulcher built by the Crusaders. From the time of the Crusades and until 1950, a relic of the Holy Cross was kept in the central chapel.\nOf great interest, in the last little chapel, entering on the right, there is permanently placed the large wooden group of the Adoration of the Magi, with man-sized statues. It is the oldest known crib in the world made up of statues in the round. [5] A detailed study of the work published in 1981 by Massimo Ferretti, at the end of the first major restoration carried out by Marisa and Otello Caprara, has identified that the sculptor of the statues is the same Master of the Crucifix 1291 kept in the Art Collections of the City of Bologna . The work was first sculpted by trunks of lime and elm, perhaps in the last decade of the thirteenth century by an anonymous Bolognese sculptor. The work remained colorless until 1370, when it was commissioned by the Bolognese painter Simone dei Crocifissi who took care of the rich polychrome and gilding with his very personal Gothic style. The 1981 restoration brought out the splendid polychrome, which had darkened over the centuries, as you can see in the photos before that restoration. But with the subsequent passing of years the humidity of the Church, in which the work was exhibited throughout the year, had begun to ruin the polychrome again. For this reason, at the beginning of 2000 the statues were taken a couple at a time and were restored again, until 2004, when all the work was exhibited in the Pinacoteca di Bologna, where it remained until Christmas 2006, when it was reported to Santo Stefano. Finally, on 21 January 2007 the complete work was inaugurated inside a large electronically controlled humidity and temperature case, equipped with shatterproof glass, which houses the entire group in a permanent and permanent form.\nIn this church there are also pieces of frescoes from the 14th century, in particular a fragment showing Sant'Orsola with her companions of martyrdom and a pregnant Madonna who, besides being of exquisite workmanship, touches the loving gesture with which she caresses her bursting belly; the other hand of the Virgin holds a book.\nThe last little chapel on the right has been dedicated, in recent times, to the Bersaglieri, but is devoid of artistic content.\n\n\n== Scholarly interest ==\nThe focus of scholarly discussion has been for many years the supposed similarity between the so-called \"New Jerusalem\" rebuilt here, according to a vita written in 1180, by Saint Petronius in the 5th century, and the largely lost 4th-century complex erected by Constantine the Great at the purported site of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Unfortunately the archaeological evidence from Bologna dates primarily to the 11th and 12th centuries, leaving the question about an earlier date still unanswered (at least until 1981). On the other hand, archaeology has meanwhile delivered many answers regarding the Constantinian church complex from Jerusalem, therefore the main interest presented by the 12th-century parts of the Church of Santo Stefano might much rather be their similarity to the almost contemporary Crusader Church of the Holy Sepulchre from Jerusalem, of which not all parts are preserved.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "The Basilica of San Petronio is a minor basilica and church of the Archdiocese of Bologna located in Bologna, Emilia Romagna, northern Italy. It dominates Piazza Maggiore. The basilica is dedicated to the patron saint of the city, Saint Petronius, who was the bishop of Bologna in the fifth century. Construction began in 1390 and its main facade has remained unfinished since. The building was transferred from the city to the diocese in 1929; the basilica was finally consecrated in 1954. It has been the seat of the relics of Bologna's patron saint only since 2000; until then they were preserved in the Santo Stefano church of Bologna.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nIn 1388, the Consiglio Generale dei Seicento prepared the construction of the church as a civic temple. To make room for the church, the adjacent Curia of Sancti Ambrosii was demolished, together with the majority of one of the city's burgs, including at least eight churches and towers. The first stone of construction was laid on 7 June 1390 under the supervision of architect Antonio di Vincenzo. Works lasted for several centuries: after the completion of the first version of the facade, in 1393 the first pair of side chapels were begun. The series were completed only in 1479.The third bay was built in 1441\u20131446. Its construction was delayed by the cardinal Baldassarre Cossa, who sold the construction material of the basilica and kept the money.\n\nIn 1514, Arduino degli Arriguzzi was chosen as the architect to construct the dome. His proposal included a large dome resting upon the width between the side aisles, which necessitated larger transepts and apses. This led to a form of a Latin cross, which was said to outdo St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The project was considered too complicated, and after building the first two pillars and two triangular pylons for the dome, the work was halted. According to legend, Pope Pius IV halted the \"megalomaniac dream\" and instead encouraged the construction of the Archiginnasio of Bologna.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe basilica is a large church measuring 132 metres long, 66 metres wide, and 47 metres tall, and is described as the \"most imposing\" church in Bologna. The fa\u00e7ade was designed by Domenico da Varignana and started in 1538 by Giacomo Ranuzzi. However, it remains unfinished.The main doorway (Porta Magna) was decorated by Jacopo della Quercia of Siena with scenes from the Old Testament on the pillars, eighteen prophets on the archivolt, scenes from the New Testament on the architrave, and a Madonna and Child, Saint Ambrose and Saint Petronius on the tympanum. It is flanked by two side doors, with Alfonso Lombardi's Resurrection on the left and Amico Aspertini's Deposition on the right.The central nave covering and apse shooting were completed in 1663, designed by Girolamo Rainaldi and directed by Francesco Martini. The lower naves are enclosed by rectilinear walls. The first two windows were designed by Antonio with the assistance of Francesco di Simone, Domenico da Milano, Pagno di Lapo Portigiani and Antonio di Simone. The bell tower was designed by Giovanni da Brensa and built between 1481 and 1487. \nIn 2017, the proposal for completing the facade by Inter-Esse Studio was awarded the first place in the international competition of wall was held by CODE - Competitions for Designers and Con-fine Art.\nDetails of the decoration of the main doorway by Jacopo della Quercia, photographed by Paolo Monti\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nThe interior houses a Madonna with Saints by Lorenzo Costa the Younger, and a Piet\u00e0 by Amico Aspertini.\n\n\n==== Main altar ====\nThe altar contains a 15th-century wooden crucifix. At the back, a fresco of the Madonna with St. Petronio by Marcantonio Franceschini and Luigi Quaini, cartoons by Cignani (1672). The ciborium of the main altar was built in 1547 by Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola.The fifteenth-century wooden choir was completed by Agostino de 'Marchi. The vaulting and decoration of the central nave is by Girolamo Rainaldi, who completed them in 1646-1658.\n\n\n==== Side chapels ====\nThe nave contains twenty-two side chapels:\n\nChapel of St. Abbondio, formerly of the Dieci di Balia - restored in neo-Gothic style in 1865.

The musical organisation had been officially instituted by Pope Eugenius IV in 1436; the first regularly paid instrumentalists were added in the late sixteenth century, and in the seventeenth century San Petronio was renowned for its sacred instrumental and choral music, with its two great organs, completed in 1476 and 1596, both still in remarkably original condition; the library remains a rich archival repository.  Three successive maestri di cappella marked the great age of music at San Petronio: Maurizio Cazzati (1657\u201371), Giovanni Paolo Colonna (1674\u201395) and Giacomo Antonio Perti (1696\u20131756). The current maestro, since 1996, is the harpsichordist Sergio Vartolo who has revitalised the cappella with a series of recordings for Naxos, Tactus, Brilliant Classics and Bongiovanni.\n\n\n== Cassini's Meridian Line ==\n\nThe church hosts also a marking in the form of a meridian line inlaid in the paving of the left aisle in 1655; it was calculated and designed by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who was teaching astronomy at the University. \nA meridian line does not indicate the time: instead, with its length of 66.8 metres (219 ft) it is one of the largest astronomical instruments in the world, allowing measurements that were for the time uniquely precise. The sun light, entering through a 27.07 mm (1.066 in) hole placed at a 27.07 m (88.8 ft) height in the church wall, projects an elliptical image of the sun, which at local noon falls exactly on the meridian line and every day is different as to position and size. The position of the projected image along the line allows to determine accurately the daily altitude of the sun at noon, from which Cassini was able to calculate with unprecedented precision astronomical parameters such as the obliquity of the ecliptic, the duration of the tropical year and the timing of equinoxes and solstices.\nOn the other hand, the size of the projected sun's image, and in particular its rate of variation during the year, allowed Cassini the first experimental verification of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\nCassini and Domenico Guglielmini published an illustrated account of how the meridian line was accomplished in 1695.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBolognese bell ringing art, which was conceived and created in the Basilica's bell tower\nSanta Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, whose meridian line Pope Clement XI commissioned to rival Bologna's\nPalazzo dei Banchi\nPalazzo d'Accursio\nPalazzo del Podest\u00e0, Bologna\nPalazzo dei Notai\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHeilbron, J.L.

          "The basilica is a beautiful architectural, historical & religious landmark. The artwork inside is amazing. There is more than one level to this basilica with only stairs (as far as I know) to reach the other levels. I love St. Francis for his affinity for animals & his belief",
          "Not far from the Piazza Maggiore and although it's a little off the main track it's worth a look if you have time",
          "We bumped on this Church accidentally while looking for a dinner recommendation in that way. It's some 15 min walk west of the main Piazza Maggiore. However it was nice to visit it, a combination of Romanesque and Gothic architecture and a beautiful altar piece. Several bishop",
          "Worth a visit especially if you are in the Pratello area, not far from Piazza Maggiore in any case. It's a very impressive romanesque/gothic basilica and has a fascinating history like everywhere in Bologna.",
          "This church for the Franciscan community was completed in 1254. The church has a Romanesque facade and two bell towers. The interior is French Gothic architecture.",
          "The Basilica San Francesco is a bit to the west of the centre of all the action in Bologna but fortunately our B&B was on this side of town so relatively easy to find for us and its very close to Via del Pratello with its collection of interesting bars and restaurants. However",
          "It is a bit of a walk to get to from Piazza Maggiore but well worth the visit. Spectacular inside and very few people about.",
          "A huge building, and one of the big bascilicas in have seen. It is standing away from the Piazza Maggiore, but in a walkable distance.",
          "This was the church that set the template for the design of Franciscan churches in mediaeval times, though in its final state it was probably too ornate and too large for the taste of the austere St Francis. It is a magnificent piece of early Gothic church architecture, both",
          "Beautiful gothic religious space, impression that it is run effectively, and open to worshippers and visitors.",
          "Interesting place, you can enjoy in the evenings from outside and during the day outside and inside.",
          "This is somewhat out of the way and not really worth the effort. There are so many more interesting churches or basilicas to go to, I would give this a miss unless you have lots and lots of time. The only thing that I thought was wonderful about it was the carved stone altar",
          "Stumbled across this when we took the land train tour. It is lovely with a lovely garden, definitely worth a visit.",
          "We visited a number of churches in Bologna and this was definitely the best. I am not a big fan of the rather overblown baroque interiors found in most of the Italian churches. San Francesco retains it medieval interiro with some beautiful side chapels and fantastic carved stone",
          "This is in a pretty non-touristy area but not actually very far out of the centre. We wandered in and first found ourselves in an unusual and memorable bric-a-brac sale set around an old cloister. We then found the main entrance to the church, which was enormous, beautiful and",
          "We were coming back from Basilica di San Luca and passed this basilica going back into the old town. It was pretty enough, there was a Sunday service on inside. We saw it and it is very pretty although it\u2019s location is a bit far away from all the action. So... if you do miss",
          "Whilst this church is perhaps not as stunning as some of the others it still is a lovely peaceful place and worth a visit Again there\u2019s a lovely side altar in the main church used for Confession and behind the beautiful and very impressive altar there are several side altars",
          "I can\u2019t overstate my admiration for the magnificent churches in this fabulous medieval city. This one with its distinctive green roofed little buildings in front is so eye catching. Highly recommended",
          "A little bit out of the way (but only by a few blocks) this church is perhaps the most beautiful of all of those in Bologna. NOT to be missed!",
          "About ten minutes from Piazza Maggiore, this church is situated in a quiet square and, while not containing any major artworks, is a lovely, restful church.",
          "Not as impressive as some of the other churches in Bologna but worth a visit if you are nearby. It's 700m from Piazza Maggiore",

          "A ten minute walk west of Piazze Maggiore, this is a haven of tranquillity in the busy city of Bologna. Founded in the 13th century this cathedral was badly damaged during WW2 but the sympathetic restoration has been very well done. There are some wonderful frescoes to enjoy.",
          "This church is approx. 10 mins' walk from Piazza Maggoire. A little off the center but good for visiting. It was built in the 13th century but is still well preserved whether on the inside or outside of the church with some tombs in the ground.",
          "Another chapel that is worth a visit. Most ask for a donation only so there is not an official entry price.",

          "The gothical construction is most impressive, especially the white marble altar. Of special interesst are the three external sarcophages covered with green tiles. We did not find much explication about the latter.",
          "This is not a church you find easily because it is a little outside the main cluster of attractions in Bologna but it is well worth visiting for its awe-inspiring architecture and calm interior. The front fa\u00e7ade is very impressive and the piazza in front allows you to step back",
          "In the midst of grand churches that defy gravity and challenge the imagination, this is a more personal church that is quiet and personally inviting. Persons who love to quietly walk Bologna and are open to inspecting everything on the way will really enjoy this church.",

          "I think we spent 4 hours here and could have spent more! Is it a really commercialized version of everything Italy produces, yes. Is it too expensive, yes. But if you love Italian food and you are near Bologna it's something you shouldn't miss, not at the expense of more",

          "I don\u2019t see the point of having this shopping mall in Bologna. It feels like a tourist trap trying to follow the American way of selling products. You can have the same quality food everywhere you go in Italy for half of the price and \u2026",

          "In terms of the animals, I was hoping for more of a real farm feel but it felt more like an exhibition. The place was interesting but felt like being inside of a mall. If going for lunch, find a place early because the restaurants fill up quickly.",

          "A very large food shop with restaurants. I think it lacks atmosphere, though - maybe it's just too big. If it's raining it might be worth spending an afternoon there. It would be great if they would cater for pedestrians a bit better, as getting there on foot is kinda difficult.",

          "So great",
          "The excellent products of Italy under a roof, you can watch the production of cheese, panettone, coffee etc behind the glass. Of course the prices are a bit higher than usual but the quality is worthy. We didn't visit the external part.

        "wiki": "Bologna (, UK also , Italian: [bo\u02c8lo\u0272\u0272a] (listen); Emilian (Bolognese dialect): Bul\u00e5ggna [bu\u02c8l\u028c\u0272\u02d0a]; Latin: Bononia) is the capital and largest city of the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy with about 390,000 inhabitants and 150 different nationalities. Its metropolitan area is home to more than 1,000,000 people.Originally Etruscan, the city has been one of the most important urban centres for centuries, first under the Etruscans (Felsina), then under the Celts as Bona, later under the Romans (Bononia), then again in the Middle Ages, as a free municipality and signoria, when it was among the largest European cities by population. Famous for its towers, churches and lengthy porticoes, Bologna has a well-preserved historical centre, thanks to a careful restoration and conservation policy which began at the end of the 1970s. Home to the oldest university in the world, the University of Bologna, established in AD 1088, the city has a large student population that gives it a cosmopolitan character.  In 2000 it was declared European capital of culture and in 2006, a UNESCO \"City of Music\" and became part of the Creative Cities Network.Bologna is an important agricultural, industrial, financial and transport hub, where many large mechanical, electronic and food companies have their headquarters as well as one of the largest permanent trade fairs in Europe. According to the most recent data gathered by the European Regional Economic Growth Index (E-REGI) of 2009, Bologna is the first Italian city and the 47th European city in terms of its economic growth rate. As a consequence, Bologna is also one of the wealthiest cities in Italy, often ranking as one of the top cities in terms of quality of life in the country: in 2011 it ranked 1st out of 107 Italian cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity and Middle Ages ===\n\nTraces of human habitation in the area of Bologna go back to the 3rd millennium BCE, with significant settlements from about the 9th century BCE (Villanova culture). \nThe influence of Etruscan civilization reached the area in the 7th to 6th centuries, and the Etruscan city of Felsina was founded at the site of Bologna by the end of the 6th century.\nBy the 4th century BCE, the site was occupied by the Gaulish Boii, and it became a Roman colony and municipium with the name of Bononia in 196 BCE. \nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, Bologna, then a frontier outpost of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna, was repeatedly sacked by the Goths; it is in this period that legendary Bishop Petronius, according to ancient chronicles, rebuilt the ruined town and founded the basilica of Saint Stephen. Petronius is still revered as patron saint of Bologna.\nIn 727\u201328, the city was sacked and captured by the Lombards under King Liutprand, becoming part of that kingdom. These Germanic conquerors built an important new quarter, called \"addizione longobarda\" (Italian meaning \"Longobard addition\") near the complex of St. Stephen. In the last quarter of the 8th century, Charlemagne, at the request of Pope Adrian I, invaded the Lombard Kingdom, causing its eventual demise. Occupied by Frankish troops in 774 on behalf of the papacy, Bologna remained under imperial authority and prospered as a frontier mark of the Carolingian empire.After the death of Matilda of Tuscany in 1115, Bologna obtained substantial concessions from Emperor Henry V. However, when Frederick Barbarossa subsequently attempted to strike down the deal, Bologna joined the Lombard League, which then defeated the imperial armies at the Battle of Legnano and established an effective autonomy at the Peace of Constance in 1183. Subsequently, the town began to expand rapidly and became one of the main commercial trade centres of northern Italy thanks to a system of canals that allowed barges and ships to come and go. Believed to have been established in 1088, the University of Bologna is widely considered the world's oldest university in continuous operation. The university originated as a centre for the study of medieval Roman law under major glossators, including Irnerius. It numbered Dante, Boccaccio and Petrarch among its students. The medical school was especially renowned. By 1200, Bologna was a thriving commercial and artisanal centre of about 10,000 people.During a campaign to support the imperial cities of Modena and Cremona against Bologna, Frederick II's son, King Enzo of Sardinia, was defeated and captured on 26 May 1249 at the Battle of Fossalta. Though the emperor demanded his release, Enzo was thenceforth kept a knightly prisoner in Bologna, in a palace that came to be named Palazzo Re Enzo after him. Every attempt to escape or to rescue him failed, and he died after more than 22 years in captivity. After the death of his half-brothers Conrad IV in 1254, Frederick of Antioch in 1256 and Manfred in 1266, as well as the execution his nephew Conradin in 1268, he was the last of the Hohenstaufen heirs.\nDuring the late 1200s, Bologna was affected by political instability when the most prominent families incessantly fought for the control of the town. The free commune was severely weakened by decades of infighting, allowing the Pope to impose the rule of his envoy Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget in 1327. Du Pouget was eventually ousted by a popular rebellion and Bologna became a signoria under Taddeo Pepoli in 1334. By the arrival of the Black Death in 1348, Bologna had 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants, reduced to just 20,000 to 25,000 after the plague.In 1350, Bologna was conquered by Archbishop Giovanni Visconti, the new lord of Milan. However, following a rebellion by the town's governor, a renegade member of the Visconti family, Bologna was recuperated to the papacy in 1363 by Cardinal Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz after a long negotiation involving a huge indemnity paid to Bernab\u00f2 Visconti, Giovanni's heir, who died in 1354. In 1376, Bologna again revolted against Papal rule and joined Florence in the unsuccessful War of the Eight Saints. However, extreme infighting inside the Holy See after the Western Schism prevented the papacy from restoring its domination over Bologna, so it remained relatively independent for some decades as an oligarchic republic. In 1401, Giovanni I Bentivoglio took power in a coup with the support of Milan, but the Milanese, having turned his back on them and allied with Florence, marched on Bologna and had Giovanni killed the following year. In 1442, Hannibal I Bentivoglio, Giovanni's nephew, recovered Bologna from the Milanese, only to be assassinated in a conspiracy plotted by Pope Eugene IV three years later. But the signoria of the Bentivoglio family was then firmly established, and the power passed to his cousin Sante Bentivoglio, who ruled until 1462, followed by Giovanni II. Giovanni II managed to resist the expansionist designs of Cesare Borgia for some time, but on 7 October 1506, Pope Julius II issued a bull deposing and excommunicating Bentivoglio and placing the city under interdict. When the papal troops, along with a contingent sent by Louis XII of France, marched against Bologna, Bentivoglio and his family fled. Julius II entered the city triumphantly on 10 November.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\nThe period of Papal rule over Bologna (1506\u20131796) has been generally evaluated by historians as one of severe decline. \nHowever, this was not evident in the 1500s, which were marked by some major developments in Bologna. In 1530, Emperor Charles V was crowned in Bologna, the last of the Holy Roman Emperors to be crowned by the pope.\nIn 1564, the Piazza del Nettuno and the Palazzo dei Banchi were built, along with the Archiginnasio, the main building of the university. The period of Papal rule saw also the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the restoration of older ones. At this time, Bologna had ninety-six convents, more than any other Italian city. Painters working in Bologna during this period established the Bolognese School which includes Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Guercino and others of European fame.\n\nIt was only towards the end of the 16th century that severe signs of decline began to manifest. A series of plagues in the late 16th to early 17th century reduced the population of the city from some 72,000 in the mid-16th century to about 47,000 by 1630.  During the Italian Plague of 1629\u201331 alone Bologna lost up to a third of its population. In the mid-17th century, population stabilized at roughly 60,000, slowly increasing to some 70,000 by the mid-18th century. The economy of Bologna started to show signs of severe decline as the global centres of trade shifted towards the Atlantic. The traditional silk industry was in a critical state. The university was losing students, who once came from all over Europe, because of the illiberal attitudes of the Church towards culture (especially after the trial of Galileo). Bologna continued to suffer a progressive deindustrialisation also in the 18th century.In the mid-1700s pope Benedict XIV, a Bolognese, tried to reverse the decline of the city with a series of reforms intended to stimulate the economy and promote the arts. However, these reforms achieved only mixed results. The pope's efforts to stimulate the decaying textile industry had little success, while he was more successful in reforming the tax system, liberalising trade and relaxing the oppressive system of censorship.The economic and demographic decline of Bologna became even more noticeable starting from the second half of the 18th century. In 1790 the city had 72,000 inhabitants, ranking as the second largest in the Papal States; however this figure had remained unchanged for decades. The economy was stagnant because of Papal policies that distorted trade with heavy custom duties and sold concessions of monopolies to single manufacturers thus lowering competition, depressing productivity and incentivising corruption.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nNapoleon entered Bologna on 19 June 1796. Napoleon briefly reinstated the ancient mode of government, giving power to the Senate, which however had to swear fealty to the short lived Cispadane Republic, created as a client state of the French Empire at the congress of Reggio (27 December 1796 \u2013 9 January 1797) but succeeded by the Cisalpine Republic on 9 July 1797, later by the Italian Republic and finally the Kingdom of Italy. \nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 restored Bologna to the Papal States. \nPapal rule was contested in the uprisings of 1831. The insurrected provinces planned to unite as the Province Italiane Unite with Bologna as capital. Pope Gregory XVI asked for \nAustrian help against the rebels. Metternich warned French king Louis Philippe I against intervention in Italian affairs, and in the spring of 1831, Austrian forces marched across the Italian peninsula, defeating the rebellion by 26 April.By the mid 1840s, unemployment levels were very high and traditional industries continued to languish or disappear; Bologna became a city of economic disparity with the top 10 percent of the population living off rent, another 20 percent exercising professions or commerce and 70 percent working in low-paid, often insecure manual jobs. The Papal census of 1841 reported 10,000 permanent beggars and another 30,000 (out of a total population of 70,000) who lived in poverty. \nIn the revolutions of 1848 the Austrian garrisons which controlled the city on behalf of the Pope were temporarily expelled, but eventually came back and crushed the revolutionaries.\nPapal rule finally ended in the aftermath of Second War of Italian Independence, when the French and Pidemontese troops expelled the Austrians from Italian lands, on 11 and 12 March 1860, Bologna voted to join the new Kingdom of Italy.\nIn the last decades of the 19th century, Bologna once again thrived economically and socially. In 1863 Naples was linked to Rome by railway, and the following year Bologna to Florence. Bolognese moderate agrarian elites, that supported liberal insurgencies against the papacy and were admirers of the British political system and of free trade, envisioned a unified national state that would open a bigger market for the massive agricultural production of the Emilian plains. Indeed, Bologna gave Italy one of its first prime ministers, Marco Minghetti.\nAfter World War I, Bologna was heavily involved in the Biennio Rosso socialist uprisings. As a consequence, the traditionally moderate elites of the city turned their back on the progressive faction and gave their support to the rising Fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. Dino Grandi, a high-ranking Fascist party official and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, remembered for being an Anglophile, was from Bologna. During the interwar years, Bologna developed into an important manufacturing centre for food processing, agricultural machinery and metalworking. The Fascist regime poured in massive investments, for example with the setting up of a giant tobacco manufacturing plant in 1937.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nBologna suffered extensive damage during World War II. The strategic importance of the city as an industrial and railway hub connecting northern and central Italy made it a target for the Allied forces. On 24 July 1943, a massive aerial bombardment destroyed a significant part of the historic city centre and killed about 200 people. The main railway station and adjoining areas were severely hit, and 44% of the buildings in the centre were listed as having been destroyed or severely damaged. The city was heavily bombed again on 25 September. The raids, which this time were not confined to the city centre, left 2,481 people dead and 2,000 injured. By the end of the war, 43% of all buildings in Bologna had been destroyed or damaged.After the armistice of 1943, the city became a key centre of the Italian resistance movement. On 7 November 1944, a pitched battle around Porta Lame, waged by partisans of the 7th Brigade of the Gruppi d'Azione Patriottica against Fascist and Nazi occupation forces, did not succeed in triggering a general uprising, despite being one of the largest resistance-led urban conflicts in the European theatre. Resistance forces entered Bologna on the morning of 21 April 1945. By this time, the Germans had already largely left the city in the face of the Allied advance, spearheaded by Polish forces advancing from the east during the Battle of Bologna which had been fought since 9 April. First to arrive in the centre was the 87th Infantry Regiment of the Friuli Combat Group under general Arturo Scattini, who entered the centre from Porta Maggiore to the south. Since the soldiers were dressed in British outfits, they were initially thought to be part of the allied forces; when the local inhabitants heard the soldiers were speaking Italian, they poured out onto the streets to celebrate.\n\n\n==== Cold war period ====\n\nIn the post-war years, Bologna became a thriving industrial centre as well as a political stronghold of the Italian Communist Party. Between 1945 and 1999, the city was helmed by an uninterrupted succession of mayors from the PCI and its successors, the Democratic Party of the Left and Democrats of the Left, the first of whom was Giuseppe Dozza. At the end of the 1960s the city authorities, worried by massive gentrification and suburbanisation, asked Japanese starchitect Kenzo Tange to sketch a master plan for a new town north of Bologna; however, the project that came out in 1970 was evaluated as too ambitious and expensive. Eventually the city council, in spite of vetoing Tange's master plan, decided to keep his project for a new exhibition centre and business district. At the end of 1978 the construction of a tower block and several diverse buildings and structures started. In 1985 the headquarters of the regional government of Emilia-Romagna moved in the new district.In 1977 Bologna was the scene of rioting linked to the Movement of 1977, a spontaneous political movement of the time. The police shooting of a far-left activist, Francesco Lorusso, sparked two days of street clashes.  On 2 August 1980, at the height of the \"years of lead\", a terrorist bomb was set off in the central railway station of Bologna killing 85 people and wounding 200, an event which is known in Italy as the Bologna massacre. In 1995, members of the neo-fascist group Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari were convicted for carrying out the attack, while Licio Gelli\u2014Grand Master of the underground Freemason lodge Propaganda Due (P2)\u2014was convicted for hampering the investigation, together with three agents of the secret military intelligence service SISMI (including Francesco Pazienza and Pietro Musumeci). Commemorations take place in Bologna on 2 August each year, culminating in a concert in the main square.\n\n\n==== Recent history ====\nIn 1999 the long tradition of left-wing mayors was interrupted by the victory of independent centre-right candidate Giorgio Guazzaloca. However, Bologna reverted to form in 2004 when Sergio Cofferati, a former trade union leader, unseated Guazzaloca. The next centre-left mayor, Flavio Delbono, elected in June 2009, resigned in January 2010 after being involved in a corruption scandal. After a 15-month period in which the city was administered under Anna Maria Cancellieri (as a state-appointed prefect), Virginio Merola was elected as mayor, leading a left-wing coalition comprising the Democratic Party, Left Ecology Freedom and Italy of Values.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Territory ===\n\nBologna is situated on the edge of the Po Plain at the foot of the Apennine Mountains, at the meeting of the Reno and Savena river valleys. As Bologna's two main watercourses flow directly to the sea, the town lies outside of the drainage basin of the River Po. The Province of Bologna stretches from the western edge of the Po Plain on the border with Ferrara to the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. The centre of the town is 54 metres (177 ft) above sea level (while elevation within the municipality ranges from 29 metres (95 ft) in the suburb of Corticella to 300 metres (980 ft) in Sabbiuno and the Colle della Guardia). The Province of Bologna stretches from the Po Plain into the Apennines; the highest point in the province is the peak of Corno alle Scale (in Lizzano in Belvedere) at 1,945 metres (6,381 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBologna has a mid-latitude, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa).\nAnnual precipitation oscillates between around 450 mm (18 in) and 900 mm (35 in), with the majority generally falling in spring and autumn. The last major snow event was in November 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (Consiglio Comunale), which is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a corrected proportional system (granting the majority to the list or alliance of lists which receives more votes), contextually to the mayoral elections.  The executive body is the City Committee (Giunta Comunale), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Bologna is Virginio Merola (PD), elected on 16 May 2011 with the 50.5% of the votes. On 19 June 2016 Merola was re-elected in a second-round ballot with 54.64% of votes.The municipality of Bologna is subdivided into six administrative Boroughs (Quartieri), down from the former nine before the 2015 administrative reform. Each Borough is governed by a Council (Consiglio) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organization is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities.\n\n\n=== Provincial and regional government ===\n\nBologna is the capital of the eponymous metropolitan city and of Emilia-Romagna, one of the twenty regions of Italy. While the Province of Bologna has a population of 1,007,644, making it the twelfth most populated province of Italy, Emilia-Romagna ranks as the sixth most populated region of Italy, with about 4.5 million inhabitants, more than 7% of the national total. The seat of the regional government is Fiera District, a tower complex designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange in 1985.\nAccording to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Bologna is one of the 15 Metropolitan municipalities (citt\u00e0 metropolitane), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Bologna is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor (Sindaco metropolitano), presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 18 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality.\nThe Metropolitan City of Bologna is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and by the Metropolitan Council (Consiglio metropolitano). Since 21 June 2016 Virginio Merola, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nUntil the late 19th century, when a large-scale urban renewal project was undertaken, Bologna was one of the few remaining large walled cities in Europe; to this day and despite having suffered considerable bombing damage in 1944, Bologna's 142 hectares (350 acres) historic centre is Europe's second largest, containing an immense wealth of important medieval, renaissance, and baroque artistic monuments.\nBologna developed along the Via Emilia as an Etruscan and later Roman colony; the Via Emilia still runs straight through the city under the changing names of Strada Maggiore, Rizzoli, Ugo Bassi, and San Felice. Due to its Roman heritage, the central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement. The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. No more than twenty medieval defensive towers remain out of up to 180 that were built in the 12th and 13th centuries before the arrival of unified civic government. The most famous of the towers of Bologna are the central \"Due Torri\" (Asinelli and Garisenda), whose iconic leaning forms provide a popular symbol of the town.The cityscape is further enriched by its elegant and extensive porticoes, for which the city is famous. In total, there are some 38 kilometres (24 miles) of porticoes in the city's historical centre (over 45 km (28 mi) in the city proper), which make it possible to walk for long distances sheltered from the elements.\nThe Portico di San Luca is possibly the world's longest. It connects Porta Saragozza (one of the twelve gates of the ancient walls built in the Middle Ages, which circled a 7.5 km (4.7 mi) part of the city) with the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca, a church begun in 1723 on the site of an 11th-century edifice which had already been enlarged in the 14th century, prominently located on a hill (289 metres (948 feet)) overlooking the town, which is one of Bologna's main landmarks. The windy 666 vault arcades, almost four kilometres (3,796 m or 12,454 ft) long, effectively links San Luca, as the church is commonly called, to the city centre. Its porticos provide shelter for the traditional procession which every year since 1433 has carried a Byzantine icon of the Madonna with Child attributed to Luke the Evangelist down to the Bologna Cathedral during the Feast of the Ascension.San Petronio Basilica, built between 1388 and 1479 (but still unfinished), is the tenth-largest church in the world by volume, 132 metres long and 66 metres wide, while the vault reaches 45 metres inside and 51 metres in the facade. With its volume of 258,000 m3, it is the largest (Gothic or otherwise) church built of bricks of the world. The Basilica of Saint Stephen and its sanctuary are among the oldest structures in Bologna, having been built starting from the 8th century, according to the tradition on the site of an ancient temple dedicated to Egyptian goddess Isis. The Basilica of Saint Dominic is an example of Romanic architecture from the 13th century, enriched by the monumental tombs of great Bolognese glossators Rolandino de'Passeggeri and Egidio Foscherari. Basilicas of St Francis, Santa Maria dei Servi and San Giacomo Maggiore are other magnificent examples of 14th-century architecture, the latter also featuring Renaissance artworks such as the Bentivoglio Altarpiece by Lorenzo Costa. Finally, the Church of San Michele in Bosco is a 15th-century religious complex located on a hill not far from the city's historical cente.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn terms of total GDP, the Metropolitan City of Bologna generated a value of about \u20ac35 billion ($40.6 billion) in 2017, equivalent to \u20ac34,251 ($40,165) per capita, the third highest figure among Italian provinces (after Milan and Bolzano/Bozen).The economy of Bologna is characterized by a flourishing industrial sector, traditionally centered on the transformation of agricultural and zootechnical products (Granarolo, Segafredo Zanetti, Conserve Italia), machinery (Coesia, IMA), energy (Hera Group), automotive (Ducati, Lamborghini), footwear, textile, engineering, chemical, printing and publishing (il Mulino, Monrif Group, Zanichelli).\nIn particular, Bologna is considered the centre of the so-called \"packaging valley\", an area well known for its high concentration of firms specialised in the manufacturing of automatic packaging machines. Furthermore, Bologna is well known for its dense network of cooperatives, a feature that dates back to the social struggles of farmers and workers in the 1800s and that today produces up to a third of its GDP and occupies 265 thousand people in the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBologna is home to the Guglielmo Marconi International Airport, the seventh busiest Italian airport for passenger traffic (8 million passengers handled in 2017).\nBologna Centrale railway station is one of Italy's most important train hubs thanks to the city's strategic location as a crossroad between north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes. It serves 58 million passengers annually. The city hosts several minor railway stations (see List of railway stations in Bologna).\nIn addition, Bologna San Donato classification yard, with 33 railway tracks, is the largest freight hub in Italy by size and traffic.The city is also served by a large network of public bus lines, including trolleybus lines, operated since 2012 by Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna (TPER).\nA large commuter rail service is currently under development (see Bologna metropolitan railway service), and a four line tram network is also planned (see Trams in Bologna).\n\n\n=== Bologna public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bologna, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 53 min. 9% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 16% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.4 km, while 7% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2016, the city proper had a population of 388,254 (while 1 million live in the greater Bologna area), located in the province of Bologna, Emilia Romagna, of whom 46.7% were male and 53.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 12.86 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 27.02 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bologna resident is 51 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bologna grew by 0.0 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bologna is 8.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nAs of 2009, 89.47% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Romanians and Albanians): 2.82%, East Asia (mostly Filipino): 1.50%, and South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh): 1.39%.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Bologna, conventionally said to have been founded in 1088 by glossators Irnerius and Pepo, is the oldest university in Europe. It was an important centre of European intellectual life during the Middle Ages, attracting scholars from Italy and throughout Europe. The Studium, as it was originally known, began as a loosely organized teaching system with each master collecting fees from students on an individual basis. The location of the early University was thus spread throughout the city, with various colleges being founded to support students of a specific nationality.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era, the headquarters of the university were moved to their present location on Via Zamboni, in the north-eastern sector of the city centre. Today, the University's 11 schools, 33 departments, and 93 libraries are spread across the city and include four subsidiary campuses in nearby Cesena, Forl\u00ec, Ravenna, and Rimini. Noteworthy students present at the university in centuries past included Dante, Petrarch, Thomas Becket, Pope Nicholas V, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Copernicus. Laura Bassi, appointed in 1732, became the first woman to officially teach at a university in Europe. In more recent history, Luigi Galvani, the discoverer of bioelectromagnetics, and Guglielmo Marconi, the pioneer of radio technology, also worked at the University. The University of Bologna remains one of the most respected and dynamic post-secondary educational institutions in Italy. To this day, Bologna is still very much a university town, with over 80,000 enrolled students in 2015. This community includes a great number of Erasmus, Socrates, and overseas students. The university's botanical garden, the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, was established in 1568; it is the fourth oldest in Europe.\nJohns Hopkins University maintains its Bologna Center in the city, which hosts one of the overseas campuses of the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). SAIS Bologna was founded in 1955 as the first campus of a US post-graduate school to open in Europe. It was inspired by Marshall Plan efforts to build a cultural bridge between America and Europe. Today, the Bologna Center also hosts the Associazione italo-americana \"Luciano Finelli\", which supports cross-cultural awareness and exchange between Italy and the United States.In addition, Bologna hosts a music school, Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini, established in 1804, and an art school, Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna, founded in 1802. Both institutions were born as part of the reforms introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOver the centuries, Bologna has acquired many nicknames: \"the fat\" (la grassa) refers to its cuisine, in which the most famous specialities are prepared using rich meats (especially pork), egg pasta and dairy products, such as butter and Parmesan. Another nickname that has been given to the city is \"the red\" (la rossa), which was originally \nused as a reference to the colour of the buildings in the city centre, has later become connected with the communist ideology supported by the majority of the population, in particular after World War II: until the election of a centre-right mayor in 1999, the city was renowned as a bastion of the Italian Communist Party. The centre-left regained power again in the 2004 mayoral elections, with the election of Sergio Cofferati. It was one of the first European cities to experiment with the concept of free public transport.\nBologna has also two other nicknames: the first one, \"the towered\" (la turrita) refers to the high number of medieval towers that can be found in the city, even if today only 24 towers are still standing. The second one, \"the learned\" (la dotta) is a reference to its university.\n\n\n=== University ===\nBologna university was founded in 1088 and it is considered the oldest university of the Western world. According to the QS University Rankings, Bologna university is the 4th Italian university and the 180th in the world.\nThe high number of students coming from all over Italy and the world (in Bologna there are several campuses of foreign universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Dickinson College, Indiana University, Brown University, University of California and more) considerably affects the everyday life: if on one hand it contributes to liven up the city centre (an area in which the average age of the residents is very high), and it also helps to promote cultural initiatives, on the other hand it creates public order and garbage problems which are related to the lively nightlife of the university district.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe city of Bologna became a UNESCO City of Music on 26 May 2006. According to UNESCO, \"As the first Italian city to be appointed to the Network, Bologna has demonstrated a rich musical tradition that is continuing to evolve as a vibrant factor of contemporary life and creation. It has also shown a strong commitment to promoting music as an important vehicle for inclusion in the fight against racism and in an effort to encourage economic and social development. Fostering a wide range of genres from classical to electronic, jazz, folk and opera, Bologna offers its citizens a musical vitality that deeply infiltrates the city's professional, academic, social and cultural facets.\"The theatre was a popular form of entertainment in Bologna until the 16th century. The first public theater was the Teatro alla Scala, active since 1547 in Palazzo del Podest\u00e0. An important figure of Italian Bolognese theatre was Alfredo Testoni, the playwright, author of The Cardinal Lambertini, which has had great theatrical success since 1905, repeated on screen by the Bolognese actor Gino Cervi. In 1998, the City of Bologna initiated the project \"Bologna dei Teatri\" (Bologna of the Theatres), an association of the major theatrical facilities in the city. This is a circuit of theatres which offer diverse theatrical opportunities, ranging from Bolognese dialect to contemporary dance, but with a communications strategy and promoting unity. Specifically, the shows on the bill in various theatres participating in the project are advertised weekly through a single poster. Bologna's opera house is the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The Orchestra Mozart, whose music director was Claudio Abbado until his death in 2014, was created in 2004.\nBologna hosts a number of international music, art, dance and film festivals, including Angelica Bologna and Contemporanea (festivals on contemporary music), Bolognafestival (international classical music festival),\nBologna Jazz Festival, Biografilm Festival (a film festival devote to biographic movies), BilBolBul (a comics festival), Danza Urbana (a street contemporary dance festival) F.I.S.Co(festival on contemporary art, now merged in Live Arts Week) Future Film Festival (animation and special effects),Il Cinema Ritrovato(film festival about rare and forgotten movies), Live Arts Week, Gender Bender (festival on gender identity, sexual orientation and body representation), Homework festival (electronic music festival), Human Rights Film Festival, Some Prefer Cake (lesbian film festival), Zecchino d'Oro (a children's song contest).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has baptised the famous Bolognese sauce, a meat-based pasta sauce that in Italy is called rag\u00f9 and is substantially different from the variety found worldwide; moreover, in Bologna the sauce is used only as a dressing for tagliatelle, serving it with spaghetti being considered odd. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured pork meats such as prosciutto, mortadella and salumi is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include Pignoletto dei Colli Bolognesi, Lambrusco di Modena and Sangiovese di Romagna. Tagliatelle with rag\u00f9, lasagne, tortellini served in broth, and mortadella, the original Bologna sausage, are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti (\"cookies of the dead\"), multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for All Saints' Day, jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on Saint Joseph's Day, and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar, certosino or panspeziale (\"carthusian\" o \"apothecary-cake\"), a spicy cake served on Christmas. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year, as the zuppa inglese.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nA sporting nickname for Bologna is Basket City in reference to the successes of the town's two rival historic basketball clubs, Virtus and Fortitudo, though the clubs are now often referred to by the names of their current sponsors.\nOf the two, the former won 15 Italian basketball championships and two Euroleagues making them one of the most influential European basketball clubs; the latter won two league titles between 1999 and 2005.\nThe rivalry is temporarily dormant since Fortitudo left the country's professional ranks when, following the 2008\u201309 season, the club was relegated from the top-level Lega A to LegADue, before being relegated further to the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti for financial reasons; in the 2012\u201313 season, Fortitudo will play in the LegADue.\nThe Italian Basketball League, which operates both Lega A and LegADue, has its headquarters in Bologna.\nFootball also has a strong tradition in Bologna. \nThe city's main club, Bologna F.C. 1909, have won seven Italian league championships (the latest in 1963\u201364), which make them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league; in their heyday in the 1930s Bologna FC were called \"Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa\" (Italian for \"The Team that Shakes the World\").\nThe club play at the 38,000-capacity Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, which has hosted the Italian national team in both football and rugby union, as well as the San Marino national football team.\nIt was also a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nRugby union is also present in the city: Rugby Bologna 1928 is not only one of the oldest Italian rugby union clubs but also the first ever club affiliated to the Italian rugby union federation. and, to date (2014) is Italy's oldest rugby union club still in operation.\nThe club took part to the top tier of the Italian championship for the first 25 years of their history never winning the title but getting to the runner-up place several times; they returned in top division (Serie A1 then Super 10), in the late 1990s and faced serious financial problems which led them to the relegation and almost to disappearance.Gianni Falchi Stadium is a baseball stadium located in Bologna. It is home to the home games of Fortitudo Baseball Bologna, in the Italian Baseball League.\n\n\n== People ==\n\nUlisse Aldrovandi (naturalist, 1522\u20131605)\nAntonio Alessandrini (anatomist and

        "wiki": "The University of Bologna (Italian: Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, UNIBO) is a research university in Bologna, Italy.\nFounded in 1088 by an organised guild of students (hence studiorum), it is the oldest university in the world, as well as one of the leading academic institutions in Italy and Europe. It is one of the most prestigious Italian universities, commonly ranking in the first places of national rankings.\nIt was the first place of study to use the term universitas for the corporations of students and masters, which came to define the institution (especially its famous law school) located in Bologna.The university's emblem carries the motto Alma mater studiorum (\"Nourishing mother of studies\") and the date A.D. 1088, and it has about 86,500 students in its 11 schools.\nIt has campuses in Ravenna, Forl\u00ec, Cesena and Rimini and a branch center abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It also has a school of excellence named Collegio Superiore di Bologna. An associate publisher of the University of Bologna is the Bononia University Press.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088. The university was granted a charter (Authentica habita) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci traced the founding of the University back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously-operating university in the world. However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \u201cit is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term university before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\u201dThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as universitates scholarium) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and ars dictaminis (scrivenery). The lectures were given in informal schools called scholae. In time the various universitates scholarium decided to form a larger association, or Studium\u2014thus, the university. The Studium grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. There was also collective bargaining with the scholars who served as professors at the university. By the initiation or threat of a student strike, the students could enforce their demands as to the content of courses and the pay professors would receive. University professors were hired, fired, and had their pay determined by an elected council of two representatives from every student \"nation\" which governed the institution, with the most important decisions requiring a majority vote from all the students to ratify. The professors could also be fined if they failed to finish classes on time, or complete course material by the end of the semester. A student committee, the \"Denouncers of Professors\", kept tabs on them and reported any misbehavior. Professors themselves were not powerless, however, forming collegia doctorum (professors\u2019 committees) in each faculty, and securing the rights to set examination fees and degree requirements. Eventually, the city ended this arrangement, paying professors from tax revenues and making it a chartered public university.\n\nThe university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law; indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the Digest, a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law. Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate.\nIn 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a  papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna - a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\nHigher education processes are being harmonised across the European Community. Nowadays the university offers 101 different \"Laurea\" or \"Laurea breve\" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 \"Laurea specialistica\" or \"Laurea magistrale\" second-level degrees (two years). However, other 11 courses have maintained preceding rules of \"Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico\" or \"Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry which requires six years of courses. After the \"Laurea\" one may attain 1st level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a Postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to 2nd level Master, specialisation schools (residency), or doctorates of research (PhD).\nThe 11 Schools (which replace the preexisting 23 faculties) are:\n\nSchool of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine\nSchool of Economics, Management and Statistics\nSchool of Engineering and Architecture\nSchool of Foreign Languages and Literature, Interpretation and Translation\nSchool of Law\nSchool of Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage\nSchool of Medicine and Surgery\nSchool of Pharmacy, Biotechnologies and Sport Sciences\nSchool of Political Sciences\nSchool of Psychology and Education Sciences\nSchool of SciencesThe university is structured in 33 departments (there were 66 until 2012), organized by homogeneous research domains that integrate activities related to one or more faculty. A new department of Latin history was added in 2015.\nThe 33 departments are:\n\nArchitecture - DA\nCultural Heritage - DBC\nChemistry \"Giacomo Ciamician\" - CHIM\nIndustrial Chemistry \"Toso Montanari\" - CHIMIND\nArts - DARvipem\nPharmacy and Biotechnology - FaBiT\nClassical Philology and Italian Studies - FICLIT\nPhilosophy and Communication Studies - FILCOM\nPhysics and Astronomy - DIFA\nComputer Science and Engineering - DISI\nCivil, Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering - DICAM\nElectrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering \"Guglielmo Marconi\" - DEI\nIndustrial Engineering - DIN\nInterpreting and Translation - DIT\nModern Languages, Literatures, and Cultures - LILEC\nMathematics - MAT\nExperimental Medicine, Diagnostic Medicine and Specialty Medicine - DIMES\nPsychology - PSI\nAgricultural Sciences - DipSA\nManagement - DiSA\nBiological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences - BiGeA\nBiomedical and Neuromotor Sciences - DIBINEM\nEducation Studies \"Giovanni Maria Bertin\" - EDU\nAgricultural and Food Sciences - DISTAL\nEconomics - DSE\nLegal Studies - DSG\nMedical and Surgical Sciences - DIMEC\nVeterinary Medical Sciences - DIMEVET\nDepartment for Life Quality Studies - QUVI\nPolitical and Social Sciences - SPS\nStatistical Sciences \"Paolo Fortunati\" - STAT\nSociology and Business Law - SDE\nHistory and Cultures - DiSCi\n\n\n== Affiliates and other institutions ==\n\n\n=== Il Mulino ===\nIn the early 1950s, some students of the University of Bologna were among the founders of the review \"il Mulino\". On 25 April 1951 the first issue of the review was published in Bologna. In a short time, \"il Mulino\" became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate, and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad. Editorial activities evolved along with the review. In 1954, the il Mulino publishing house (Societ\u00e0 editrice il Mulino) was founded, which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers. In addition to this were initiated research projects (focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy), that eventually led, in 1964, to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo.\n\n\n=== Collegio Superiore ===\nThe Collegio Superiore  is an excellence institution inside the University of Bologna, aimed at promoting students' merit through dedicated learning programmes. \nThe institution was founded in 1998 as Collegio d'Eccellenza. Together with the Institute for Advanced Study it is part of the Institute for Higher Study. \nThe Collegio Superiore offers an additional educational path to students enrolled in a degree programme at the University of Bologna, providing specialized courses as part of an interdisciplinary framework.\nAll students of the Collegio Superiore are granted a full-ride scholarship and additional benefits such as the assistance of a personal tutor and free accommodation at the Residence for Higher Study. In order to remain members of the Collegio Superiore students are required to maintain high marks in both their degree programme and the additional courses.\nBeatrice Fraboni, professor of Physics of Matter, has been head of Collegio Superiore since 2019. \n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Alumni ===\nCardinal Alberto Bolognetti;\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer;\nPope Alexander VI;\nAugusto Righi, pioneer in the study of electromagnetism;\nCarlo Goldoni;\nCarlo Severini;\nSaint Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan;\nDante Alighieri;\nDiego Della Valle;\nEnzo Ferrari;\nErasmus of Rotterdam;\nGabriele Paleotti;\nGasparo Tagliacozzi, pioneer of plastic and reconstructive surgery;\nGiacomo Matteotti;\nGiovanni Pascoli;\nPope Gregory XIII (Ugo Boncompagni);\nPope Gregory XV;\nGuglielmo Marconi;\nHenry of Susa (Hostiensis);\nPope Innocent IX;\nIrnerius, founder of the School of Glossators;\nLaura Bassi, the world's first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies;\nLazzaro Spallanzani;\nLeon Battista Alberti;\nLuigi Galvani;\nManuel Olivencia, lawyer and academic;\nMarcello Malpighi;\nMichelangelo Antonioni;\nNicolaus Copernicus, formulator of the heliocentric universal model;\nCardinal Paolo Burali d'Arezzo;\nParacelsus, founder of the discipline of toxicology;\nPetrarch;\nPico della Mirandola;\nPier Paolo Pasolini;\nPietro Mengoli;\nArchbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket;\nTorquato Tasso;\nUlisse Aldrovandi;\nUmberto Eco.\n\n\n=== Faculty and staff ===\nSee:  Serafino Mazzetti, Repertorio di tutti I professori antichi e moderni della famosa Universit\u00e0...di Bologna (Bologna 1848).\n\n11th century\nIrnerius\n12th century\nBulgarus\nGratian\nMartinus Gosia\nPatriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem\nWilliam of Tyre\n13th century\nBenvenutus Scotivoli\nBettisia Gozzadini\nGuido Guinizelli\nHenry of Susa (Hostiensis)\nPaul, Dominican martyr\nRambertino Buvalelli\nSylvester Gozzolini\nWilliam of Saliceto\n14th century\nColuccio Salutati\nFrancesco Petrarca (also known as Petrarch)\nGiovanni de' Marignolli\nManuel Chrysoloras\n15th century\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola\nLeon Battista Alberti\nLippo Bartolomeo Dardi\nNicolaus Copernicus\nYuriy Drohobych (also known as Georgius de Drohobycz)\n16th century\nCamillo Baldi\nGiovanni Antonio Magini\nGiovanni Della Casa\nGirolamo Cardano\nGirolamo Maggi\nIgnazio Danti\nParacelsus\nUlisse Aldrovandi\nVirgilio Malvezzi\n17th century\nGiovanni Cassini\nMarcello Malpighi\nNiall \u00d3 Glac\u00e1in\nPietro Mengoli\n18th century\nCarlo Goldoni\nLaura Bassi\nLuigi Galvani\nMaria Gaetana Agnesi\n19th century\nAugusto Righi\nFrancesco Selmi\nGiacomo Ciamician\nGiosu\u00e8 Carducci\nGiovanni Pascoli\nPellegrino Rossi\n20th century\nGuglielmo Marconi\nPier Paolo Pasolini\nRomano Prodi\nUmberto Eco\n21st century\nGabriella Campadelli-Fiume\nHamida Barmaki\n\u00d6zalp Babao\u011flu\nPier Cesare Bori\nAugusto Barbera\nIvano Dionigi\n\n\n== Rankings and reputation ==\nThe 2020 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Bologna 177th in the world, as well as 74th (1st in Italy) with reference to \"academic reputation\".

          "This museum has many star exhibits. There are two problems. One is that the attendants outnumber the visitors. This allows them the luxury of oppressively following visitors around to make sure they dont misbehave, eg by deviating from the official route to go back and spend",
          "The museum has interesting artifacts on show, but the descriptions accompanying them are limited (especially for English speakers). I had the feeling there were very interesting stories to be told about Bologna\u2019s rich history, sadly this museum tells none of them :( My advice:",
          "Tucked away from the main streets of Bologna, this small yet very historical museum is a gem! I took a tour on my own, no rush and most of the area's you can take pictures. It is laid out oddly, allot of up/down stairs and walkways. The history is amazing and very unexpected.",

          "What a great gem of a museum to visit. Several works of art, treasures, and items describing the medieval history of this part of Europe. There are English version placards located on the wall to follow along on many of the items. The museum did an excellent job in the layout,",
          "Plenty of fire arms and armor, and to be fair something to hold everyone's interest. The limited English signage was disappointing,especially after the audio player malfunctioned. Actually, even before the mechanical problem, the aristocratic, nasal annotator could not manage",
          "I found this museum on a trip to Bologna. I was trying to find another attraction when I saw the sign pointing this out an on a whim decided to visit. I had such a great time. It looks really small from the outside but has so much to see and take in. I found that there was",

        "wiki": "Bologna (, UK also , Italian: [bo\u02c8lo\u0272\u0272a] (listen); Emilian (Bolognese dialect): Bul\u00e5ggna [bu\u02c8l\u028c\u0272\u02d0a]; Latin: Bononia) is the capital and largest city of the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy with about 390,000 inhabitants and 150 different nationalities. Its metropolitan area is home to more than 1,000,000 people.Originally Etruscan, the city has been one of the most important urban centres for centuries, first under the Etruscans (Felsina), then under the Celts as Bona, later under the Romans (Bononia), then again in the Middle Ages, as a free municipality and signoria, when it was among the largest European cities by population. Famous for its towers, churches and lengthy porticoes, Bologna has a well-preserved historical centre, thanks to a careful restoration and conservation policy which began at the end of the 1970s. Home to the oldest university in the world, the University of Bologna, established in AD 1088, the city has a large student population that gives it a cosmopolitan character.  In 2000 it was declared European capital of culture and in 2006, a UNESCO \"City of Music\" and became part of the Creative Cities Network.Bologna is an important agricultural, industrial, financial and transport hub, where many large mechanical, electronic and food companies have their headquarters as well as one of the largest permanent trade fairs in Europe. According to the most recent data gathered by the European Regional Economic Growth Index (E-REGI) of 2009, Bologna is the first Italian city and the 47th European city in terms of its economic growth rate. As a consequence, Bologna is also one of the wealthiest cities in Italy, often ranking as one of the top cities in terms of quality of life in the country: in 2011 it ranked 1st out of 107 Italian cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity and Middle Ages ===\n\nTraces of human habitation in the area of Bologna go back to the 3rd millennium BCE, with significant settlements from about the 9th century BCE (Villanova culture). \nThe influence of Etruscan civilization reached the area in the 7th to 6th centuries, and the Etruscan city of Felsina was founded at the site of Bologna by the end of the 6th century.\nBy the 4th century BCE, the site was occupied by the Gaulish Boii, and it became a Roman colony and municipium with the name of Bononia in 196 BCE. \nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, Bologna, then a frontier outpost of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna, was repeatedly sacked by the Goths; it is in this period that legendary Bishop Petronius, according to ancient chronicles, rebuilt the ruined town and founded the basilica of Saint Stephen. Petronius is still revered as patron saint of Bologna.\nIn 727\u201328, the city was sacked and captured by the Lombards under King Liutprand, becoming part of that kingdom. These Germanic conquerors built an important new quarter, called \"addizione longobarda\" (Italian meaning \"Longobard addition\") near the complex of St. Stephen. In the last quarter of the 8th century, Charlemagne, at the request of Pope Adrian I, invaded the Lombard Kingdom, causing its eventual demise. Occupied by Frankish troops in 774 on behalf of the papacy, Bologna remained under imperial authority and prospered as a frontier mark of the Carolingian empire.After the death of Matilda of Tuscany in 1115, Bologna obtained substantial concessions from Emperor Henry V. However, when Frederick Barbarossa subsequently attempted to strike down the deal, Bologna joined the Lombard League, which then defeated the imperial armies at the Battle of Legnano and established an effective autonomy at the Peace of Constance in 1183. Subsequently, the town began to expand rapidly and became one of the main commercial trade centres of northern Italy thanks to a system of canals that allowed barges and ships to come and go. Believed to have been established in 1088, the University of Bologna is widely considered the world's oldest university in continuous operation. The university originated as a centre for the study of medieval Roman law under major glossators, including Irnerius. It numbered Dante, Boccaccio and Petrarch among its students. The medical school was especially renowned. By 1200, Bologna was a thriving commercial and artisanal centre of about 10,000 people.During a campaign to support the imperial cities of Modena and Cremona against Bologna, Frederick II's son, King Enzo of Sardinia, was defeated and captured on 26 May 1249 at the Battle of Fossalta. Though the emperor demanded his release, Enzo was thenceforth kept a knightly prisoner in Bologna, in a palace that came to be named Palazzo Re Enzo after him. Every attempt to escape or to rescue him failed, and he died after more than 22 years in captivity. After the death of his half-brothers Conrad IV in 1254, Frederick of Antioch in 1256 and Manfred in 1266, as well as the execution his nephew Conradin in 1268, he was the last of the Hohenstaufen heirs.\nDuring the late 1200s, Bologna was affected by political instability when the most prominent families incessantly fought for the control of the town. The free commune was severely weakened by decades of infighting, allowing the Pope to impose the rule of his envoy Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget in 1327. Du Pouget was eventually ousted by a popular rebellion and Bologna became a signoria under Taddeo Pepoli in 1334. By the arrival of the Black Death in 1348, Bologna had 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants, reduced to just 20,000 to 25,000 after the plague.In 1350, Bologna was conquered by Archbishop Giovanni Visconti, the new lord of Milan. However, following a rebellion by the town's governor, a renegade member of the Visconti family, Bologna was recuperated to the papacy in 1363 by Cardinal Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz after a long negotiation involving a huge indemnity paid to Bernab\u00f2 Visconti, Giovanni's heir, who died in 1354. In 1376, Bologna again revolted against Papal rule and joined Florence in the unsuccessful War of the Eight Saints. However, extreme infighting inside the Holy See after the Western Schism prevented the papacy from restoring its domination over Bologna, so it remained relatively independent for some decades as an oligarchic republic. In 1401, Giovanni I Bentivoglio took power in a coup with the support of Milan, but the Milanese, having turned his back on them and allied with Florence, marched on Bologna and had Giovanni killed the following year. In 1442, Hannibal I Bentivoglio, Giovanni's nephew, recovered Bologna from the Milanese, only to be assassinated in a conspiracy plotted by Pope Eugene IV three years later. But the signoria of the Bentivoglio family was then firmly established, and the power passed to his cousin Sante Bentivoglio, who ruled until 1462, followed by Giovanni II. Giovanni II managed to resist the expansionist designs of Cesare Borgia for some time, but on 7 October 1506, Pope Julius II issued a bull deposing and excommunicating Bentivoglio and placing the city under interdict. When the papal troops, along with a contingent sent by Louis XII of France, marched against Bologna, Bentivoglio and his family fled. Julius II entered the city triumphantly on 10 November.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\nThe period of Papal rule over Bologna (1506\u20131796) has been generally evaluated by historians as one of severe decline. \nHowever, this was not evident in the 1500s, which were marked by some major developments in Bologna. In 1530, Emperor Charles V was crowned in Bologna, the last of the Holy Roman Emperors to be crowned by the pope.\nIn 1564, the Piazza del Nettuno and the Palazzo dei Banchi were built, along with the Archiginnasio, the main building of the university. The period of Papal rule saw also the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the restoration of older ones. At this time, Bologna had ninety-six convents, more than any other Italian city. Painters working in Bologna during this period established the Bolognese School which includes Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Guercino and others of European fame.\n\nIt was only towards the end of the 16th century that severe signs of decline began to manifest. A series of plagues in the late 16th to early 17th century reduced the population of the city from some 72,000 in the mid-16th century to about 47,000 by 1630.  During the Italian Plague of 1629\u201331 alone Bologna lost up to a third of its population. In the mid-17th century, population stabilized at roughly 60,000, slowly increasing to some 70,000 by the mid-18th century. The economy of Bologna started to show signs of severe decline as the global centres of trade shifted towards the Atlantic. The traditional silk industry was in a critical state. The university was losing students, who once came from all over Europe, because of the illiberal attitudes of the Church towards culture (especially after the trial of Galileo). Bologna continued to suffer a progressive deindustrialisation also in the 18th century.In the mid-1700s pope Benedict XIV, a Bolognese, tried to reverse the decline of the city with a series of reforms intended to stimulate the economy and promote the arts. However, these reforms achieved only mixed results. The pope's efforts to stimulate the decaying textile industry had little success, while he was more successful in reforming the tax system, liberalising trade and relaxing the oppressive system of censorship.The economic and demographic decline of Bologna became even more noticeable starting from the second half of the 18th century. In 1790 the city had 72,000 inhabitants, ranking as the second largest in the Papal States; however this figure had remained unchanged for decades. The economy was stagnant because of Papal policies that distorted trade with heavy custom duties and sold concessions of monopolies to single manufacturers thus lowering competition, depressing productivity and incentivising corruption.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nNapoleon entered Bologna on 19 June 1796. Napoleon briefly reinstated the ancient mode of government, giving power to the Senate, which however had to swear fealty to the short lived Cispadane Republic, created as a client state of the French Empire at the congress of Reggio (27 December 1796 \u2013 9 January 1797) but succeeded by the Cisalpine Republic on 9 July 1797, later by the Italian Republic and finally the Kingdom of Italy. \nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 restored Bologna to the Papal States. \nPapal rule was contested in the uprisings of 1831. The insurrected provinces planned to unite as the Province Italiane Unite with Bologna as capital. Pope Gregory XVI asked for \nAustrian help against the rebels. Metternich warned French king Louis Philippe I against intervention in Italian affairs, and in the spring of 1831, Austrian forces marched across the Italian peninsula, defeating the rebellion by 26 April.By the mid 1840s, unemployment levels were very high and traditional industries continued to languish or disappear; Bologna became a city of economic disparity with the top 10 percent of the population living off rent, another 20 percent exercising professions or commerce and 70 percent working in low-paid, often insecure manual jobs. The Papal census of 1841 reported 10,000 permanent beggars and another 30,000 (out of a total population of 70,000) who lived in poverty. \nIn the revolutions of 1848 the Austrian garrisons which controlled the city on behalf of the Pope were temporarily expelled, but eventually came back and crushed the revolutionaries.\nPapal rule finally ended in the aftermath of Second War of Italian Independence, when the French and Pidemontese troops expelled the Austrians from Italian lands, on 11 and 12 March 1860, Bologna voted to join the new Kingdom of Italy.\nIn the last decades of the 19th century, Bologna once again thrived economically and socially. In 1863 Naples was linked to Rome by railway, and the following year Bologna to Florence. Bolognese moderate agrarian elites, that supported liberal insurgencies against the papacy and were admirers of the British political system and of free trade, envisioned a unified national state that would open a bigger market for the massive agricultural production of the Emilian plains. Indeed, Bologna gave Italy one of its first prime ministers, Marco Minghetti.\nAfter World War I, Bologna was heavily involved in the Biennio Rosso socialist uprisings. As a consequence, the traditionally moderate elites of the city turned their back on the progressive faction and gave their support to the rising Fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. Dino Grandi, a high-ranking Fascist party official and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, remembered for being an Anglophile, was from Bologna. During the interwar years, Bologna developed into an important manufacturing centre for food processing, agricultural machinery and metalworking. The Fascist regime poured in massive investments, for example with the setting up of a giant tobacco manufacturing plant in 1937.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nBologna suffered extensive damage during World War II. The strategic importance of the city as an industrial and railway hub connecting northern and central Italy made it a target for the Allied forces. On 24 July 1943, a massive aerial bombardment destroyed a significant part of the historic city centre and killed about 200 people. The main railway station and adjoining areas were severely hit, and 44% of the buildings in the centre were listed as having been destroyed or severely damaged. The city was heavily bombed again on 25 September. The raids, which this time were not confined to the city centre, left 2,481 people dead and 2,000 injured. By the end of the war, 43% of all buildings in Bologna had been destroyed or damaged.After the armistice of 1943, the city became a key centre of the Italian resistance movement. On 7 November 1944, a pitched battle around Porta Lame, waged by partisans of the 7th Brigade of the Gruppi d'Azione Patriottica against Fascist and Nazi occupation forces, did not succeed in triggering a general uprising, despite being one of the largest resistance-led urban conflicts in the European theatre. Resistance forces entered Bologna on the morning of 21 April 1945. By this time, the Germans had already largely left the city in the face of the Allied advance, spearheaded by Polish forces advancing from the east during the Battle of Bologna which had been fought since 9 April. First to arrive in the centre was the 87th Infantry Regiment of the Friuli Combat Group under general Arturo Scattini, who entered the centre from Porta Maggiore to the south. Since the soldiers were dressed in British outfits, they were initially thought to be part of the allied forces; when the local inhabitants heard the soldiers were speaking Italian, they poured out onto the streets to celebrate.\n\n\n==== Cold war period ====\n\nIn the post-war years, Bologna became a thriving industrial centre as well as a political stronghold of the Italian Communist Party. Between 1945 and 1999, the city was helmed by an uninterrupted succession of mayors from the PCI and its successors, the Democratic Party of the Left and Democrats of the Left, the first of whom was Giuseppe Dozza. At the end of the 1960s the city authorities, worried by massive gentrification and suburbanisation, asked Japanese starchitect Kenzo Tange to sketch a master plan for a new town north of Bologna; however, the project that came out in 1970 was evaluated as too ambitious and expensive. Eventually the city council, in spite of vetoing Tange's master plan, decided to keep his project for a new exhibition centre and business district. At the end of 1978 the construction of a tower block and several diverse buildings and structures started. In 1985 the headquarters of the regional government of Emilia-Romagna moved in the new district.In 1977 Bologna was the scene of rioting linked to the Movement of 1977, a spontaneous political movement of the time. The police shooting of a far-left activist, Francesco Lorusso, sparked two days of street clashes.  On 2 August 1980, at the height of the \"years of lead\", a terrorist bomb was set off in the central railway station of Bologna killing 85 people and wounding 200, an event which is known in Italy as the Bologna massacre. In 1995, members of the neo-fascist group Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari were convicted for carrying out the attack, while Licio Gelli\u2014Grand Master of the underground Freemason lodge Propaganda Due (P2)\u2014was convicted for hampering the investigation, together with three agents of the secret military intelligence service SISMI (including Francesco Pazienza and Pietro Musumeci). Commemorations take place in Bologna on 2 August each year, culminating in a concert in the main square.\n\n\n==== Recent history ====\nIn 1999 the long tradition of left-wing mayors was interrupted by the victory of independent centre-right candidate Giorgio Guazzaloca. However, Bologna reverted to form in 2004 when Sergio Cofferati, a former trade union leader, unseated Guazzaloca. The next centre-left mayor, Flavio Delbono, elected in June 2009, resigned in January 2010 after being involved in a corruption scandal. After a 15-month period in which the city was administered under Anna Maria Cancellieri (as a state-appointed prefect), Virginio Merola was elected as mayor, leading a left-wing coalition comprising the Democratic Party, Left Ecology Freedom and Italy of Values.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Territory ===\n\nBologna is situated on the edge of the Po Plain at the foot of the Apennine Mountains, at the meeting of the Reno and Savena river valleys. As Bologna's two main watercourses flow directly to the sea, the town lies outside of the drainage basin of the River Po. The Province of Bologna stretches from the western edge of the Po Plain on the border with Ferrara to the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. The centre of the town is 54 metres (177 ft) above sea level (while elevation within the municipality ranges from 29 metres (95 ft) in the suburb of Corticella to 300 metres (980 ft) in Sabbiuno and the Colle della Guardia). The Province of Bologna stretches from the Po Plain into the Apennines; the highest point in the province is the peak of Corno alle Scale (in Lizzano in Belvedere) at 1,945 metres (6,381 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBologna has a mid-latitude, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa).\nAnnual precipitation oscillates between around 450 mm (18 in) and 900 mm (35 in), with the majority generally falling in spring and autumn. The last major snow event was in November 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (Consiglio Comunale), which is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a corrected proportional system (granting the majority to the list or alliance of lists which receives more votes), contextually to the mayoral elections.  The executive body is the City Committee (Giunta Comunale), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Bologna is Virginio Merola (PD), elected on 16 May 2011 with the 50.5% of the votes. On 19 June 2016 Merola was re-elected in a second-round ballot with 54.64% of votes.The municipality of Bologna is subdivided into six administrative Boroughs (Quartieri), down from the former nine before the 2015 administrative reform. Each Borough is governed by a Council (Consiglio) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organization is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities.\n\n\n=== Provincial and regional government ===\n\nBologna is the capital of the eponymous metropolitan city and of Emilia-Romagna, one of the twenty regions of Italy. While the Province of Bologna has a population of 1,007,644, making it the twelfth most populated province of Italy, Emilia-Romagna ranks as the sixth most populated region of Italy, with about 4.5 million inhabitants, more than 7% of the national total. The seat of the regional government is Fiera District, a tower complex designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange in 1985.\nAccording to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Bologna is one of the 15 Metropolitan municipalities (citt\u00e0 metropolitane), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Bologna is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor (Sindaco metropolitano), presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 18 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality.\nThe Metropolitan City of Bologna is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and by the Metropolitan Council (Consiglio metropolitano). Since 21 June 2016 Virginio Merola, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nUntil the late 19th century, when a large-scale urban renewal project was undertaken, Bologna was one of the few remaining large walled cities in Europe; to this day and despite having suffered considerable bombing damage in 1944, Bologna's 142 hectares (350 acres) historic centre is Europe's second largest, containing an immense wealth of important medieval, renaissance, and baroque artistic monuments.\nBologna developed along the Via Emilia as an Etruscan and later Roman colony; the Via Emilia still runs straight through the city under the changing names of Strada Maggiore, Rizzoli, Ugo Bassi, and San Felice. Due to its Roman heritage, the central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement. The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. No more than twenty medieval defensive towers remain out of up to 180 that were built in the 12th and 13th centuries before the arrival of unified civic government. The most famous of the towers of Bologna are the central \"Due Torri\" (Asinelli and Garisenda), whose iconic leaning forms provide a popular symbol of the town.The cityscape is further enriched by its elegant and extensive porticoes, for which the city is famous. In total, there are some 38 kilometres (24 miles) of porticoes in the city's historical centre (over 45 km (28 mi) in the city proper), which make it possible to walk for long distances sheltered from the elements.\nThe Portico di San Luca is possibly the world's longest. It connects Porta Saragozza (one of the twelve gates of the ancient walls built in the Middle Ages, which circled a 7.5 km (4.7 mi) part of the city) with the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca, a church begun in 1723 on the site of an 11th-century edifice which had already been enlarged in the 14th century, prominently located on a hill (289 metres (948 feet)) overlooking the town, which is one of Bologna's main landmarks. The windy 666 vault arcades, almost four kilometres (3,796 m or 12,454 ft) long, effectively links San Luca, as the church is commonly called, to the city centre. Its porticos provide shelter for the traditional procession which every year since 1433 has carried a Byzantine icon of the Madonna with Child attributed to Luke the Evangelist down to the Bologna Cathedral during the Feast of the Ascension.San Petronio Basilica, built between 1388 and 1479 (but still unfinished), is the tenth-largest church in the world by volume, 132 metres long and 66 metres wide, while the vault reaches 45 metres inside and 51 metres in the facade. With its volume of 258,000 m3, it is the largest (Gothic or otherwise) church built of bricks of the world. The Basilica of Saint Stephen and its sanctuary are among the oldest structures in Bologna, having been built starting from the 8th century, according to the tradition on the site of an ancient temple dedicated to Egyptian goddess Isis. The Basilica of Saint Dominic is an example of Romanic architecture from the 13th century, enriched by the monumental tombs of great Bolognese glossators Rolandino de'Passeggeri and Egidio Foscherari. Basilicas of St Francis, Santa Maria dei Servi and San Giacomo Maggiore are other magnificent examples of 14th-century architecture, the latter also featuring Renaissance artworks such as the Bentivoglio Altarpiece by Lorenzo Costa. Finally, the Church of San Michele in Bosco is a 15th-century religious complex located on a hill not far from the city's historical cente.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn terms of total GDP, the Metropolitan City of Bologna generated a value of about \u20ac35 billion ($40.6 billion) in 2017, equivalent to \u20ac34,251 ($40,165) per capita, the third highest figure among Italian provinces (after Milan and Bolzano/Bozen).The economy of Bologna is characterized by a flourishing industrial sector, traditionally centered on the transformation of agricultural and zootechnical products (Granarolo, Segafredo Zanetti, Conserve Italia), machinery (Coesia, IMA), energy (Hera Group), automotive (Ducati, Lamborghini), footwear, textile, engineering, chemical, printing and publishing (il Mulino, Monrif Group, Zanichelli).\nIn particular, Bologna is considered the centre of the so-called \"packaging valley\", an area well known for its high concentration of firms specialised in the manufacturing of automatic packaging machines. Furthermore, Bologna is well known for its dense network of cooperatives, a feature that dates back to the social struggles of farmers and workers in the 1800s and that today produces up to a third of its GDP and occupies 265 thousand people in the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBologna is home to the Guglielmo Marconi International Airport, the seventh busiest Italian airport for passenger traffic (8 million passengers handled in 2017).\nBologna Centrale railway station is one of Italy's most important train hubs thanks to the city's strategic location as a crossroad between north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes. It serves 58 million passengers annually. The city hosts several minor railway stations (see List of railway stations in Bologna).\nIn addition, Bologna San Donato classification yard, with 33 railway tracks, is the largest freight hub in Italy by size and traffic.The city is also served by a large network of public bus lines, including trolleybus lines, operated since 2012 by Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna (TPER).\nA large commuter rail service is currently under development (see Bologna metropolitan railway service), and a four line tram network is also planned (see Trams in Bologna).\n\n\n=== Bologna public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bologna, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 53 min. 9% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 16% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.4 km, while 7% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2016, the city proper had a population of 388,254 (while 1 million live in the greater Bologna area), located in the province of Bologna, Emilia Romagna, of whom 46.7% were male and 53.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 12.86 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 27.02 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bologna resident is 51 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bologna grew by 0.0 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bologna is 8.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nAs of 2009, 89.47% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Romanians and Albanians): 2.82%, East Asia (mostly Filipino): 1.50%, and South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh): 1.39%.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Bologna, conventionally said to have been founded in 1088 by glossators Irnerius and Pepo, is the oldest university in Europe. It was an important centre of European intellectual life during the Middle Ages, attracting scholars from Italy and throughout Europe. The Studium, as it was originally known, began as a loosely organized teaching system with each master collecting fees from students on an individual basis. The location of the early University was thus spread throughout the city, with various colleges being founded to support students of a specific nationality.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era, the headquarters of the university were moved to their present location on Via Zamboni, in the north-eastern sector of the city centre. Today, the University's 11 schools, 33 departments, and 93 libraries are spread across the city and include four subsidiary campuses in nearby Cesena, Forl\u00ec, Ravenna, and Rimini. Noteworthy students present at the university in centuries past included Dante, Petrarch, Thomas Becket, Pope Nicholas V, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Copernicus. Laura Bassi, appointed in 1732, became the first woman to officially teach at a university in Europe. In more recent history, Luigi Galvani, the discoverer of bioelectromagnetics, and Guglielmo Marconi, the pioneer of radio technology, also worked at the University. The University of Bologna remains one of the most respected and dynamic post-secondary educational institutions in Italy. To this day, Bologna is still very much a university town, with over 80,000 enrolled students in 2015. This community includes a great number of Erasmus, Socrates, and overseas students. The university's botanical garden, the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, was established in 1568; it is the fourth oldest in Europe.\nJohns Hopkins University maintains its Bologna Center in the city, which hosts one of the overseas campuses of the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). SAIS Bologna was founded in 1955 as the first campus of a US post-graduate school to open in Europe. It was inspired by Marshall Plan efforts to build a cultural bridge between America and Europe. Today, the Bologna Center also hosts the Associazione italo-americana \"Luciano Finelli\", which supports cross-cultural awareness and exchange between Italy and the United States.In addition, Bologna hosts a music school, Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini, established in 1804, and an art school, Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna, founded in 1802. Both institutions were born as part of the reforms introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOver the centuries, Bologna has acquired many nicknames: \"the fat\" (la grassa) refers to its cuisine, in which the most famous specialities are prepared using rich meats (especially pork), egg pasta and dairy products, such as butter and Parmesan. Another nickname that has been given to the city is \"the red\" (la rossa), which was originally \nused as a reference to the colour of the buildings in the city centre, has later become connected with the communist ideology supported by the majority of the population, in particular after World War II: until the election of a centre-right mayor in 1999, the city was renowned as a bastion of the Italian Communist Party. The centre-left regained power again in the 2004 mayoral elections, with the election of Sergio Cofferati. It was one of the first European cities to experiment with the concept of free public transport.\nBologna has also two other nicknames: the first one, \"the towered\" (la turrita) refers to the high number of medieval towers that can be found in the city, even if today only 24 towers are still standing. The second one, \"the learned\" (la dotta) is a reference to its university.\n\n\n=== University ===\nBologna university was founded in 1088 and it is considered the oldest university of the Western world. According to the QS University Rankings, Bologna university is the 4th Italian university and the 180th in the world.\nThe high number of students coming from all over Italy and the world (in Bologna there are several campuses of foreign universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Dickinson College, Indiana University, Brown University, University of California and more) considerably affects the everyday life: if on one hand it contributes to liven up the city centre (an area in which the average age of the residents is very high), and it also helps to promote cultural initiatives, on the other hand it creates public order and garbage problems which are related to the lively nightlife of the university district.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe city of Bologna became a UNESCO City of Music on 26 May 2006. According to UNESCO, \"As the first Italian city to be appointed to the Network, Bologna has demonstrated a rich musical tradition that is continuing to evolve as a vibrant factor of contemporary life and creation. It has also shown a strong commitment to promoting music as an important vehicle for inclusion in the fight against racism and in an effort to encourage economic and social development. Fostering a wide range of genres from classical to electronic, jazz, folk and opera, Bologna offers its citizens a musical vitality that deeply infiltrates the city's professional, academic, social and cultural facets.\"The theatre was a popular form of entertainment in Bologna until the 16th century. The first public theater was the Teatro alla Scala, active since 1547 in Palazzo del Podest\u00e0. An important figure of Italian Bolognese theatre was Alfredo Testoni, the playwright, author of The Cardinal Lambertini, which has had great theatrical success since 1905, repeated on screen by the Bolognese actor Gino Cervi. In 1998, the City of Bologna initiated the project \"Bologna dei Teatri\" (Bologna of the Theatres), an association of the major theatrical facilities in the city. This is a circuit of theatres which offer diverse theatrical opportunities, ranging from Bolognese dialect to contemporary dance, but with a communications strategy and promoting unity. Specifically, the shows on the bill in various theatres participating in the project are advertised weekly through a single poster. Bologna's opera house is the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The Orchestra Mozart, whose music director was Claudio Abbado until his death in 2014, was created in 2004.\nBologna hosts a number of international music, art, dance and film festivals, including Angelica Bologna and Contemporanea (festivals on contemporary music), Bolognafestival (international classical music festival),\nBologna Jazz Festival, Biografilm Festival (a film festival devote to biographic movies), BilBolBul (a comics festival), Danza Urbana (a street contemporary dance festival) F.I.S.Co(festival on contemporary art, now merged in Live Arts Week) Future Film Festival (animation and special effects),Il Cinema Ritrovato(film festival about rare and forgotten movies), Live Arts Week, Gender Bender (festival on gender identity, sexual orientation and body representation), Homework festival (electronic music festival), Human Rights Film Festival, Some Prefer Cake (lesbian film festival), Zecchino d'Oro (a children's song contest).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has baptised the famous Bolognese sauce, a meat-based pasta sauce that in Italy is called rag\u00f9 and is substantially different from the variety found worldwide; moreover, in Bologna the sauce is used only as a dressing for tagliatelle, serving it with spaghetti being considered odd. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured pork meats such as prosciutto, mortadella and salumi is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include Pignoletto dei Colli Bolognesi, Lambrusco di Modena and Sangiovese di Romagna. Tagliatelle with rag\u00f9, lasagne, tortellini served in broth, and mortadella, the original Bologna sausage, are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti (\"cookies of the dead\"), multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for All Saints' Day, jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on Saint Joseph's Day, and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar, certosino or panspeziale (\"carthusian\" o \"apothecary-cake\"), a spicy cake served on Christmas. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year, as the zuppa inglese.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nA sporting nickname for Bologna is Basket City in reference to the successes of the town's two rival historic basketball clubs, Virtus and Fortitudo, though the clubs are now often referred to by the names of their current sponsors.\nOf the two, the former won 15 Italian basketball championships and two Euroleagues making them one of the most influential European basketball clubs; the latter won two league titles between 1999 and 2005.\nThe rivalry is temporarily dormant since Fortitudo left the country's professional ranks when, following the 2008\u201309 season, the club was relegated from the top-level Lega A to LegADue, before being relegated further to the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti for financial reasons; in the 2012\u201313 season, Fortitudo will play in the LegADue.\nThe Italian Basketball League, which operates both Lega A and LegADue, has its headquarters in Bologna.\nFootball also has a strong tradition in Bologna. \nThe city's main club, Bologna F.C. 1909, have won seven Italian league championships (the latest in 1963\u201364), which make them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league; in their heyday in the 1930s Bologna FC were called \"Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa\" (Italian for \"The Team that Shakes the World\").\nThe club play at the 38,000-capacity Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, which has hosted the Italian national team in both football and rugby union, as well as the San Marino national football team.\nIt was also a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nRugby union is also present in the city: Rugby Bologna 1928 is not only one of the oldest Italian rugby union clubs but also the first ever club affiliated to the Italian rugby union federation. and, to date (2014) is Italy's oldest rugby union club still in operation.\nThe club took part to the top tier of the Italian championship for the first 25 years of their history never winning the title but getting to the runner-up place several times; they returned in top division (Serie A1 then Super 10), in the late 1990s and faced serious financial problems which led them to the relegation and almost to disappearance.Gianni Falchi Stadium is a baseball stadium located in Bologna. It is home to the home games of Fortitudo Baseball Bologna, in the Italian Baseball League.\n\n\n== People ==\n\nUlisse Aldrovandi (naturalist, 1522\u20131605)\nAntonio Alessandrini (anatomist and

          "Expecting some good things of an interactive museum of a great city, we happily paid 10 Euro entrance fee. No one else at the museum and it soon became clear. Artefacts were few and far between with poor explanation. An audio guide gave some brief but fairly dull explanations.",

          "A great and friendly space. It has the whole history of the town since the 12th century I think. You can also take a mini electronic guide with a description of all the rooms. It has also two 3d rooms which there are very nice. With this museum, you can have in 2 hours a mini",
          "This museum is a great retelling of Bologna's past, from its pre-Roman Empire years all the way up to the late 20th century. It shows a lot of exhibits dating back ages, representing different eras. Certain rooms are furnished with great props, such as the room retelling of a",
          "The museum itself is beautiful and the exhibitions of the different stages in the history of Bologna too. However, I have no idea what I have been looking at. The audio guide only gives an historic overview of the era, but not of the actual objects in the room. So, while",
          "I didn't actually go around the museum but did a 30 minute 3D experience called \"La Macchina Del Tempo\" - The time Machine. It was quite an experience, you are in a room with 3D headset and a joystick type of control box. There is a person there to make sure you are safe so",
          "This museum must meet all of the standards for modern, contemporary museums. Excellent and up-to-date museum with interesting history of Bologna. Well worth the price of admission and time spent.",
          "This looks a great museum - though a tad dear at ten euros - which could fill a whole morning but we never actually got in as the opening hours posted outside are not correct and neither are the ones on the website. Get accurate info from the tourist office on piazza Maggiore -",
          "This was one of the things that we did in Bologna that I think everyone should see. It will give you a perspective n the forming of the city and how it came to be. It is an interactive display and has an excellent narration system that will help everyone follow through the",

          "I really appreciated getting a quick overview of the long and fascinating history of Bologna. There is a very good audio guide which I recommend (it's free) because...none of the signage is in English. You can get English handouts in the corner of each of the 36 exhibit rooms,",

          "what an excellent museum in the heart of Bologna. In a grand palazzo but very modern in style and presentation. With the English audio guide it was really interesting and easy to follow. We did not choose to do the 'Tempo Machino' tour of old Bologna as we find virtual reality",
          "We had some interesting and exciting hours in this great exhibition and learned a lot about bolognian history. We really loved the \"Sightseeing\" in the Virtual Reality Room. It's a little bit expensive but it's totally worth it!!!",
          "If you have the chance, go and take the \"time machine\" tour in the museum! You have the chance to stroll through the medieval Bologna and interact with different ancient buildings and people. In the end you can even fly over the Bologna City center. Simply amazing! The time",
          "This is a well laid out museum and the audio guide is quite helpful. But the highlight for me was a documentary consisting of interviews with women who had joined the Resistance during WWII. The film is about an hour long, and it is shown on a small monitor where you have to",
          "A nice travel through time, the headset makes the information much more interesting and rich (it is free, from the gift shop).",
          "This was a real eye opener because there is so much to learn and take in. The audio guide is well worth taking because it gives you quite a bit of in-depth knowledge about each period and room as you walk through. As a first time visitor to Bologna this should be a must!",

          "This is not a huge and tiresome museum, well kept, and with a large variety of material showing the events surrounding Bologna and its history in an interesting way. One can spend anywhere between an hour or a couple of hours, depending on how much information one is prepared to",
          "A perfect view on the history of the town, without being overpowering or too scholarly. A pity that the explanations are only in Italian, however every room has leaflets in English. Thoroughly enjoyable experience. Had very nice conversation with Cesare, who went out of his way",
          "I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, especially since Bologna has many great museums that offer magical experiences and good value. This museum is definitely not worth the 11 euro for general admission. Discounted tickets for students are still a steep 8 euro, and only on",
          "very interesting collection and the illustrated manuscripts are beautiful. The whole collection is not too big that you get tired, but enough variety to be very engaging.",
          "Everything you need to know about this great city. Lots of presentations and visual things inside and not that expensive",
          "This museum houses a very diverse collection - the photos that others have posted will give you a good idea. You will definitely learn something new here, without feeling intimidated.",
          "A must for anyone with the slightest interest in how a place came to be. Very well laid out and \"user friendly\". Fosters a greater appreciation of this wonderful city.",
          "A brilliant portrait of Bologna over the ages. The personal audio system worked well with the depictions of Bologna throughout the ages. We were so glad we decided to visit. If you want the audio system do remember to take some form of identification with you. A photo copy of",
          "As a museum we didn't think this was much chop. We had an English audio guide and even that didn't help. It's sort of annoying when the audio tour doesn't include the information you know is written around the exhibits. Even then there were big hunks of missing information",
          "For a comprehensive history of Bologna and the Emilia Romagna region, this is the place. With interesting audio video displays, the visitor is taken back in time to learn about the fascinating history of this region. Then, step by step, you move through the ages to the modern",
          "We thought this museum was quite expensive on entry-8 euros each as students. But we preservered and decided not to get audio guides because it was already steep. Little did we know there was literally no English description at all throughout the museum?! They even had shelves",
          "The museum is set in the beautiful Pilazzo Pepoli Antico. The history of bologna is a well crafted multi media experience. Audio guides provide a simple but informative explanation of each display tracing all aspects of the development of Bologna. The 3D video was very",
          "This museum tells the story of the city in a very informative and interactive way. I would go as far as to say that it's one of the best museums I've ever been to. The building in itself is also worth seeing with its marvelous ceilingpaintings. Definitely worth the trip!",
          "Really enjoyed this museum visit. We all had audio guides and these are well worth paying for. It was very interesting and told the story of Bologna through the ages. We also saw the \"Street Art\" exhibition which was great fun.",
          "Thought at first we had made a mistake as start was all about modern street art. We weren't offered audio guides which initially was fine as art work had English translations but the bit we were really there to see, the history of Bologna didn't, and that was disappointing.",
          "\u20ac13 to enter. It's labelled as museum of history of Bologna. It does have a small area dedicated to the history of Bologna as well as a small collection of artefacts but it is mainly reprints and more an appreciation for street art. There are some banksy originals here and also",
          "its a Nice museum also to go with children. From the beginning to the20th century, We have a picture of Bologna and his history. The only n\u00e9gative point is that the entrance is a little bit expensive ( 15 euros).",
          "This museum gives a short introduction to the history of Bologna, only it does it solely in Italian. If you want to see it in English, you will have to pay extra after having paid 13 euros already for entrance. Looks to me like it is very interesting for those of us who speak",
          "well-laid out and structured museum, explaining in chronological order the history of Bologna, with several videographic as well as still exhibits",
          "We went to this museum with big expectations, but we were disappointed. Not much artifacts, also more attention was pointed to a temporary exhibition of famous graffiti artists. The price was 13 euro per person, but i recommend the Museo civico medievale, much more interesting",
          "This is pretending to be a museum of the history of Bologna and a must-see. It does have some history of Bologna in a number of small rooms all in Italian with no interpretive panels at all in English. Most of the artifacts in these rooms are merely images or interpretations.",
          "There is an interesting exhibition of Street Art, from early 60 up to now. Excellent choice of works from Banksy, Haring and others. On Friday open till 10 pm. The exhibition is till 26.08.2016. I reccomend it to street art lovers. Besides the exhibition the Palazzo Pepoli is",
          "This is a MUST to understand the city and it's history. I recommend it to be the first thing to do. After that all what you see as you walk through Bologna will make sense. Audioguide is very helpful.",
          "I don't expect Italian museums to be in English, but it would have been nice. I got one of the audio guides but a) it was also in Italian and b) only covered the special art exhibit. If the price was less, then I wouldn't have minded, but it was quite expensive and not worth it.",
          "Enjoyed this museum very much as it was modern and everything well presented. A lot of interesting written info but unfortunately only in Italian. You have to get one of those annoying auditory guides. I thought the price of \u20ac10 a bit steep.",
          "Once you enter the museum you're bowled over by the majesty of the entryway and the history that surrounds you in this converted palace. There are approximately 10 rooms that bring Bologna's history to life - don't go through without the auditory guide! In the entryway atrium",
          "A great way to learn about a new city, is to check out it's history museum. When done well, they provide valuable insights as this one did. The museum is housed in a wonderful former palace, built in the 1600's At Bologna's history museum, an audio guide is provided with the",

        "wiki": "Biblioteca Salaborsa is the main public library in Bologna, region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy.In 2001, the central offices of the public library were moved into the northern portions of the Palazzo d'Accursio, flanking the Piazza del Nettuno, which is just north of the Piazza Maggiore. Visitors to the library are able to see an archaeological site through the crystal floor in the centre of the library. The ancient ruins are also accessible from the basement floor, where there is information about them.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe library was opened in 2001, although the building it resides in, Palazzo d'Accursio, is far older. The ruins, on which the site was built, include remains from the ancient city of Bononia, which dates back to 189 BC. There are also Etruscan ruins on site that predate the Roman ones.

          "The best surprise for a rainy day: it was raining, so it was a museum-visiting-day. Right in front of the famous Neptune statue and fountain, is the Salabrosa Library, so I decided to have a coffee to dry up and have some measure time with my wife, after walking in the rain.",

          "The biblioteca is worth a visit but this review is about the caf\u00e9 in the basement. Warm and welcoming, packed with locals. They have a great choice of snacks, lunches etc all at reasonable price. It also a great place to sit and people wstch.",
          "Biblioteca Salaborsa, in the very centre of Bologna, well deserves a visit. Its interior is beautiful, inviting to a prolonged stay. In fact, this is a living library, with plenty of seats and space for reading and studying. There are even a number of rooms of different sizes",
          "Massive Library with unique construction and glass flooring. Very active through out the day and very Picturesque from inside",
          "This is a communal building with 3 floors. It is actually a library but has a lot to offer. You can easily find free city-wifi there. And of course under the floor you can see the original remainings from roman times. I didn't walk down the basement but even from the top it is",

          "This is a converted Commerce building. There is a transparent floor (bit murky in places) where you can see the original walls of the city. When we visited there were quite a few young children playing on the revolving chairs and fascinated by the floor.",

          "What a fabulous library and what a wonderful chance to step back in time. Below the glass tiled floor of this beautifully renovated / constructed library are the ancient Roman foundations of the city. Living, visible history. Either walk and view the foundations below your feet",

          "Not only is this a modern library in an old building, there is a bar/cafe (great tiramisu and wine!) and archeology under the glass floor. There are very cool reading chairs scattered around. Find the entrance to the ruins in the basement, it is worth spending a few minutes",
          "This is the local library and not a tourist attraction, but the building itself is beautiful. There's a small cafe inside as well with some pastries and espresso if you fancy an afternoon snack and that new book smell. It wasn't open on Monday so make plans to venture inside on",

          "The Sala Borsa is a beautiful building in its own right, the ceiling is wonderfully ornate, imposing arches & lots of light. It is free to enter & the information desk attendants are helpful & speak enough English answer necessary questions. There is a caf\u00e9 on the ground floor",
          "Even if you don't use the library, it is worth taking the time to go all the way in to the center courtyard. There, you can see some cool architecture and get a glimpse of ancient Bologna in the excavations beneath the clear glass or plastic floor.",
          "This is beautiful piece of architecture so much available for all people. What you can see here are the people silenlty reading books, news papers or just drinking coffe. In the center there is a museum of old toys. There are also old walls in the basement.",
          "Great (and free) public library. From the main floor, you can visit the archeology dig that uncovered the ruins of the city from centuries ago - well worth visiting - then head up to the top floor to visit the urban space where university students and the city are collaborating",

          "It's great that the city of Bologna provides such wonderful and free sites for tourists to enjoy. The library itself is a beautiful mix of older aesthetics and modern sensibilities. And it's really cool to see the ruins underneath when you walk in over the transparent portions",
          "If you are in the area, stop by for 5 minutes, but I didn't see anything that would warrant longer time being spent. Inside main hall has a lovely ceiling, overlooking the glass floor so you can see the ancient ruins beneath. Unfortunately the glass floor is so marked up, you",
          "We heard from our hostess about the public library and its excavated ruins visible from the glass floor as well as by stairs to the site. This is a beautiful library well used by area individuals. We went down the stair to see the actual ruins, and the guard let us in, despite",
          "This building is great. Go inside and look up and be amazed by the ceiling. Look down (and go down) and see the 'old Bologna' fra 200 BC. All those layers of building techniques are amazing. Even better its all free!",
          "You have two options with this, either you can look down on the dig through the glass floor or you can walk round it on gantries in the basement. We chose the latter but as only a few people are allowed in at a time and we didn't realise a tour group was in we had to wait a long",
          "yes go into this space, was a stock exchange now a wonderful community library. Underneath is an excavation of roman and medieval ruins",
          "If you're visiting in the center of Bologna, especially in the summer, Salaborsa could be the place for you to freshen up. It's air-conditioned space with books, coffee shop, and free wi-fi. Up to the top floor, there's an urban exhibition about Bologna and also the temporary",
          "It's always great to find something free to do in a city. Go inside and look down when you walk on the glass floor to see some excavations. The Caf\u00e9 inside is very nice for a quick drink. Inexpensive, too. The library is a great place for children.",

          "This place has been a Stock exchange center, one century ago, and it's still luxurious and refined as it had to be at the time for this purpose. At the closure of the Bologna Stock Exchange it knew other uses (also a gym) before being shut down until, a few years ago, it was",

          "The library itself is a beautiful structure, and the main floor has some art/photography exhibits that are also quite interesting. What I really found fascinating, however, was in the basement. The foundation of this building, which is one of the first building sites in Bologna",
          "An unusual library. The main attraction is the bright central hall, spacious yet cozy at the same time, with an artful soaring ceiling. We went there for wi-fi but felt so comfortable we didn't want to leave. The very welcoming coffee bar sells excellent fresh pastries, but",
          "Beautiful ceiling to gaze upon as you search for inspiration for your essay! The excavations are on the lower ground floor and are free although a donation is expected. A place that buzzes with activity.",

          "The building is a very beautiful one. It is the Accursio Palace, former seat of the historic town that overlooks the Piazza Maggiore, always the center and heart of Bologna Inside there are some ruins and a library; it is free and very much worth a quick visit.",

          "On the 3 hour walking guide of the city and just off the main square is the Biblioteca. It is a wonder to enter but when you reach the atrium and look down you realise you are on a perplex covering just above the old Roman ruins of the city. When you go down to visit the remains",
          "I used to go to study for my exams at Uni and I've seen this place change,been redocorated and improve. .It become a place where students and visitors from all over the world passed and admired. .It is not only a big library with a vast range of books and different sources, but",
          "You can find everything that you want!!!! quiet and modern library!!!Also a caffeteria inside for a short break.",
          "It took me some time to track down that the old Roman roads are underneath the library. There is little or no advertising of this fact. The roman roads and ruins can be viewed through the glass floor or you can go down stairs and walk through them on an elevated path. A must",
          "This place was not advertised at all that I could see. Discovered it by doing a bit of research. The library is in piazza maggiore on the west side. Look at the old Roman roads through the glass floor. For a much better view go downstairs and walk through the elevated path",

          "The building itself is amazing, but please consider the library as well: well stocked, beautiful places to sit down and silence. There are different spaces where to just read the newspaper, read a book or read a fairy-tale to your child.",

          "A nice public library with an interesting basement. A few tiles on the ground floor are made of glass to allow one to see some archeological ruins beneath. You're better off going downstairs and pay the paltry entry fee to see the ruins up close. Overall, an ok place to visit -",
          "Worth going down for a look, especially since the glass floor panels were so dirty u cant see thru them!",
          "I got the impression from some reviews that this was a must-see place, but was rather disappointed. It's more for city-dwellers I should think than visitors. all sorts of libraries - for Bambini, adolescenti etc, and a part glass floor so you can see ancient Bologna underneath,",
          "Bologna's central library has been housed in the Salaborsa, just off Piazza Maggiore at the Neptune statue since December 2001. Under the crystal floor of the covered square, a platform that is suspended both in space and time guides us along a stimulating stroll through",
          "You can't miss it, the stairs in front are always crowded with people, it's one of the central meeting spots in town. In summer it's a place to cool down and relax, in winter it's like a piazza inside. The bar provides coffee and snacks (fair prices) and a sitting area, upstairs",

          "It's the first place where I take friends when we go to the city centre. The library is simply marvellous - container, contents and atmosphere - and it deserves even a flash visit. Walking over the archaeological sites of different ages is fascinating: you can see them through",
          "Salaborsa has been love at first sight for me and I visit it every time I am near! If I was a local I would spend a lot of time in there. First of all it is situated in the most central spot of Bologna, next to the Neptune statue. The outside of the building with its stairs",

          "The non-Morandi part of the museum is fine, some interesting modern art pieces. The museum is spacious and well appointed. But the reason to attend is the Museo Morandi: a phenomenal, moving set of paintings that I spent hours pouring over. One of the best days I've ever had in",
          "Morandi, despite all the reviews is bloodless, repetitive and so dull. What do you expect sitting around in a room painting jars for decades without any of Picasso\u2019s talent? No he\u2019s not a genius of perspective and geometry! He\u2019s DULL! Gwen John\u2019s palette is positively exuberant",
          "Firstly, art is subjective and I fully accept that there are others who might hold very different views about the museum. The reason for the rating was that the museum is quite large and my expectation was that there would be a broad range of modern art and 'something for",
          "Look here, nice people: not all art is good, or profound, or interesting. If it doesn't resound with you, it does not mean it is over your head. Sometimes art exhibitions, galleries, and museums are nothing but a waste of time, space, energy, and money. There is nothing of",
          "We found the Museum of Modern Art to be amazing and so interesting. The temporary exhibit was refreshing.",
          "You need to be seriously interested in modern art to get the best out of a visit to MAMbo. Unlike the Tate in London or MOMA in NYC, for example, I didn\u2019t see much humour - all rather serious and, perhaps, sometimes a little pretentious; something lost to me in translation",
          "Not to be missed while in Bologna. I had a great time there. If you are an art enthusiast you will definitedly love it.",
          "It took us ages to walk to MAMbo from our B&B which was right in the centre of the Quadrilatero, but we\u2019re very glad we went. We didn\u2019t know what to expect, so we weren\u2019t disappointed. There is a cafe on site, serving good coffee! (Discount prices in Italy are only for",
          "Besides the great multimedia show of a Swiss artist at the main floor, look for the special space dedicated to Morandi. The museum was lucky enough to inherit the largest collection of this Bologna\u2019s most famous painter from his descendants.",
          "This museum is situated about 500 metres south west of the Bologna main train station and the entrance fee is 6 Euros per adult. The museum was based on 2 floors: Ground floor was the exhibition hall containing the most modern works of different artists. First floor",
          "A disappointingly small collection on display and without 5he Morandi collection you could visit everything in just 20 minutes. A very nice building with a very small art collection on display. Entrance is 6 Euros.",

          "The modem art section is really good - there just isn\u2019t a huge amount of it. The second section is ok if you enjoy art of the artist (sorry can\u2019t remember his name) lots of pictures of vases (often the same) and three rooms of it. So worth a visit but needs some expanding to",

          "With such a museum there will be artwork you love and artwork you\u2019ll hate. That\u2019s the very nature of so much modern art. We don\u2019t care if there are pieces we don\u2019t like as long as there is plenty to love. And certainly there is here. Do visit. Highly recommended",
          "I generally agree with the reviews here stating this is rather a 2nd priority museum to visit. Mainly local artists on display.",

          "We are major museum goers (live in NY and Paris) and always check out what's happening in smaller towns, often to our great delight, as was the case here. The Morandi works aside (temporarily housed in MAMbo), this is an architecturally interesting space with works displayed in",

          "This is about a 5 min walk from the train station but about 20-25 mins from Piazza Maggiore. It\u2019s a very small, modest modern art museum. There was an exhibition for a prominent local artist at the time which was easily 25-30% of the museum. You can easily see the whole",

          "I've been to Bologna approximately 8 times, but never before visited the MAMbo. On this visit I happened to be staying a few blocks from the museum and decided to visit it. The admission is reasonable (4 euros for seniors) and the building quite nice. It houses a permanent",

          "We absolutely loved this gallery. The collection is well curated with a diverse mixture of pieces spanning from the beginning of the of last century to present time. The cafe attached to it is also really fantastic.",
          "Nice small collection of modern art. You can also see the Morandi museum, which seems to be terribly boring, but after watching the video you understand more of Morandi's philosophy and you appreciate more his paintings, so take the time to watch the video.",
          "Interesting permanent collection, good special exhibits, nice building, always enjoyable to spend a few hours here",

          "If you are interested in movements of Italian modern art this gallery may be for you. Personally I found it obscure and poor value in relation to amount displayed. If you are keen on Italian culture, the entrance fee would be better spent in a bar enjoying prosecco (or being",
          "We liked the clean and modern design of the MAMbo, which is really two museums in one: the more general part is good but nothing spectacular; the real find was the Casa Morandi, in essence a whole floor dedicated to works of the rather reclusive artist from Bologna, Giorgio",
          "We were recommended to visit this as something different to do. It was a little confusing as you go in as to what are the permanent and what are the temporary exhibitions you could visit. We went for the permanent ones and there was some good abstract art there so it was worth a",
          "Morandi is a 'must' for serious artists;this is where to see him. I suggest you research him before you go; he is very subtle and not to everyone's taste.And It has a good bar too. Several good inexpensive restaurants nearby!",
          "One of the incentives to visit Bologna was to visit the Morandi collection at MAMbo - and we were not disappointed. The gallery is about ten or so minutes walk from the city centre, there is a smallish admission fee (I do not recall exactly how much, so it cannot have been a",
          "The museum is accessible on foot and has a pemanent collection as well as different temporary exhibitions. Worth a visit.",
          "Some great things to see, such as Guttuso's work; the story behind the permanent collection is very interesting",
          "The museum did have some OK works when we were there but it certainly wasn't one of the best modern art museums we've been to. Having said that, with different exhibitions things could be very different, and it was a relatively good museum to navigate around compared to some",
          "We visited MAMbo last week on our holiday in Bologna it's a great museum, The staff were very friendly. You must sign a form before entering the exhibition's if you would like to take photos. Highly recommend.",
          "After have visited 3 quarters of the exhibition a ward tells me that I need to buy a \"copyright\" ticket first. I ask him if I can do the little what remains of the exposition and buy the ticket then but that was impossible. I told him that his colleagues had to offer this at the",

          "There is lots to see here and you can easily spend half a day browsing. The fixed exhibits cover recent history of Bologna as well as more abstract art. The work linked to history was fascinating and described in both Italian and English. There is a separate fee to enter the",
          "Enjoyed a wander around MAMbo. Interesting talking points as I always expect of modern art, and that makes it well worth a visit. I think you shouldn't expect to 'get' some of the exhibits. I did find the explanations on the wall charts really helpful to understand the context",
          "Great museum, huge exhibition spaces, interesting artists. A welcome change from all the traditional art. Plus it's a nice long walk.",
          "Some galleries try to be all things to all people but this one has got it right - the variety of subject, the size, the well organised displays and a good cup of coffee next door! The Morani exhibition was being shown and that in itself was worth going the visit. Unexpectedly,",
          "It can be so boring to visit museums that try to collect what every other museum in the world has. MAMbo takes the risk of making its own choices, showing mostly Italian artists. Many more hits than misses - and the attached Giorgio Morandi museum is worth the low price of",
          "This is a small, but decent museum for contemporary art. The Morandi collecti is currently there and worth a visit.",
          "If you are enrolled at an university in Europe, you can enter the museum for free. The permanent collection is very fascinating. Also check out Ex Forno - the coffee right next to the museum.",
          "We found it disappointing. Limited range of artists and displays but the building is gracious and impressive. Expensive admission for what it was?",
          "Free to enter on first Sunday of the month. Loved the Morandi and the other exhibits that were about Morandi, especially the shelves of glassware just like Morandi might have used. I liked the views from the museum onto the buildings and suburbs outside, a damp day with",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the exhibits - not usually something I would go to but persuaded by a friends and so glad. Did not experience any miserable or unhelpful staff - quite the opposite.",
          "This would have got 5 stars but for the horrible people working there. Apart from the nice young man on the front desk and the gentleman who helped my wheelchair-bound wife, everybody was so sour faces and rude. Luckily the art was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the exhibits.",
          "I don't know what happened between 20 and 24 April when two reviewers had bad experiences in MAMbo. Ours was totally different. The staff could not have been more helpful. Almost took us by the hand to make sure we didn't miss Museo Morandi. Hard to believe that they had been",
          "Permanent contemporary collection was great although I do agree with the other review. The staff literally followed you around when you entered a room. An uncomfortable experience. Morandi's exhibition was excellent as was the photographer Catherine Wagner's In Situ. The cafe",
          "What a terrible experience, there is no excuse whether your employed or a volunteer to be so miserable. Every room we walked through the welcome was a po faced member of staff looking at us like we about to steal something. To be honest I was not that impressed by the art and",
          "I love abstract art and MAMbo has a nice (if somewhat small) collection. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Mambo offered a nice exhibit with a lot of pleasant surprises. Even when i thought I'm unimpressed with Morandi's work, i was amazed by his graphics and the sculpture in the last room produced a vocal wow-effect (but it's a secret :) ) I was utterly astonished by the Jonas",
          "We accidentally bought the wrong ticket and saw the permenant one whereas the temporary one looked more interesting! The building itself is really nice and the cafe inside is wonderful, we had mini burgers and the staff in the bar/restaurant were lovely.",
          "I was not into the current exhibition, which changes and may be very interesting next time. I only went to see the permanent exhibition. The museum part on the firdt floor was interesting (there's a second museum within the museum on the second floor which is included in the",
          "We went to see the Morandi collection and were also treated to a special exhibit of Jonas Burgert's work (it ends on April 17th). The Morandi collection is fantastic. In our view he in one of the world's (not just Italy or Bologna) greatest modern artists. We like his early",
          "A 15 minute walk from the main square. They have a permanent and also a temporary exhibition. You pay either 6 euros for the permanent exhibition or 10 euros to visit both. It's a great rainy day activity or if you've run or if things go do in the city. Recommended",
          "We were running out of things we wanted to see in Bologna; but we decided to take in MAMbo, the Museum of Modern Art di Bologna. The ground floor was devoted to a temporary exhibit of the work of a contemporary German painter, Jonas Burgert. Based on what we could see from the",
          "Unfortunately very disappointed. Limited exhibits, and pretty low calibre. Only saving grace it was free. Pop in if your passing, otherwise don't bother.",
          "The Morandi section is incomparable. The special exhibit of Berlin artist Jonas Burgert was astonishing and very well displayed. The museum space is beautiful. But the permanent collection only offered a few memorable features.",
          "Bologna is a fantastic city and some of the stuuf in MAMbo is good, but the majority is unispiring and the whole experience is spoiled by (apart from the girls on the ticket desk) the most unwelcoming staff I have ever had the displeasure experience in a public attraction.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the setup and the exhibit. Superb few works of the \"last naturalists\". Exhaustive foray into Morandi's works, a must for the lovers of the maestro. Perfect set-up for a small, but worthy art collection.",
          "For those interested in modern art this is well worth the walk to get there. Entry is free with the Bologna Welcome Card. Incorporated in the building is the Morandi Museum so it is good value for money.",
          "Made a point of visiting here when the David Bowie retrospective exhibition was on. A short distance from the railway station this was a great building/location for such. Walking from the centre of town to reach it enabled me to discover a wide variety of shops and bars.",
          "I was really surprised how good this museum was. They have an excellent selection of Transavantgarde and Arte Povera works. The Giorgio Morandi's are great to see his development and rigour as an artist. I was there for an hour but could easily stayed much longer. Excellent",
          "Doesn't take long to see it all and the Morandi works are interesting. Good for a relaxing hour or so.",
          "Enjoyed the refreshing art but not loud vocal requests not to take pictures. Apparently you can ask for a ticket to take pictures at reception. This is free. Also attendants followed us. Literally, pace by pace.",
          "A good gallery with plenty of varied exhibits. There is also a lovely outside area (although a few too many persons with bottles lurking). A good cafe and shop too.",
          "We went for the exhibition and expected it to be busy and it was. Queue for tickets with exact entry time took as long as over an hour just to get to the front.. Luckily. for us, at the last possible time slot of 22.00, they extended the opening hours by 30mins. The staff were",
          "We popped in and booked tickets for the following afternoon - and then had excellent coffees in their cafe. It is worth pre-booking tickets to avoid any possible queuing or disappointment. We like Bowie, although are not fanatical fans, so were unsure how much we would like this",
          "Enjoyed the museum so much we took a friend there a week later for a second visit and still didn't go into the Bowie special exhibition either, but that's the advantage of being older caught him first time around. The video installations had changed since our first visit so a",
          "Seeking refuge from the rain, we spent an interesting couple of hours here on a Saturday afternoon. It was very quiet in the permanent collection - but there were hundreds of people there for the Bowie exhibition - and easy to take your time walking around and enjoying all the",
          "David Bowie exhibition was really fantastic. We went to Bologna just to see this. To bad you where not aloud to take pictures.",
          "As you can see by my avatars I am a huge Bowie fan. This is my third visit to this exhibition (London and Paris as well). I thought the layout in Bologna worked well. It was quite an emotional experience especially after watching the gut wrenching video for Blackstar then",
          "We were lucky enough to be in Bologna whilst the David Bowie Exhibition was at the MAMbo. We had to queue for about half an hour to get in but it was well worth the wait. Fantastic for any music fan but a must if you are a Bowie fan. Included lots of costumes, memorabilia,",
          "I have never been a great fan of David Bowie but my partner is and after this I can see why. The collection of photographs, films and music was presented in a way that allowed everyone to see and the whole experience was quite overwhelming. Some of the information was quite",
          "We went to the museum to visit the Bowie exhibition. The museum itself is a lovely building, very spacious and good facilities. The Bowie exhibition (organised by V&A museum) was one of the best we have seen. Excellent.",
          "A very disappointing visit - the great collection of Morandi is poorly displayed - as one of the great masters of Bologna he deserves a much much better and innovative display. We were the only visitors - the bored guards were reading books - you can easily finish your doctorate",
          "Now that was \u20ac15 well spent what a fantastic exhibition about the icon that is or was #DavidBowie \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude42 great value and exhibition about a true British/world music icon that died far too young. It's Quite emotional at the life on mars part \ud83d\ude2a but I'm a huge fan",
          "Until November 2016 you can visit the exposition on Bowie. Ideal on a rainy day and a lot of fun. It's a little on the outskirts of the old center but easy to be reached on food or by bus. The organize regularly temporary expositions, so always worthwhile to check when your in",
          "When we visited the Museo David Bowie's exhibition was on. It was two hours well spent. We were given headphones and as you walked from room to room they automatically explained what you saw as well as playing music by Bowie. There were lots of artefacts relating to Bowie's",
          "Seeing the Bowie Exhibit was absolutely amazing. I have been a fan since the early 70's, and this exhibit was on my \"bucket list\"! It truly exceeded my expectations.",
          "I came across the David Bowie exhibit at the MAMbo and was it a most welcome surprise. I am not as musically inclined as my friends but I know David Bowie and this exhibit which was created after he passed away early this year is an amazing compendium of his entire career. I am",
          "Went to the David Bowie exhibition in Mambo. Quite neutral about David Bowie before I got in but got intrigued when I came out. I liked the exhibition. Interactive and versatile.",
          "I was planning to see the permanent collection but ended up spending over 3 hours in the Bowie exhibition, which as others have said is truly magnificent. Best use of technology i have ever seen in a gallery and the final room will blow your mind and really get you grooving.",
          "I'm not a fan of David Bowie, neither knowing many of his songs; but the exhibition was one of the best I have ever attended! The exhibition design was amazing starting with the bluetooth audio guide which changes your audio content with the room you've walked in. The visual",
          "The staff were friendly and helpful. There was a queue outside and they clarified that it was for the visiting exhibition (Bowie) so we hopped straight in. Well designed galleries, we really enjoyed the huge collection of paintings by Morandi.",
          "6\u20ac to get in.Another 15\u20ac if you want to see Bowie on tour. Not a lover if modern art. Very same same and no photos to be taken. Cool building but not as good as Tate Modern which is free!",
          "Most of the museum at Italy have religion exhibits. You have to see what the most recent artists think about. It is something different from the Churches and the old Museum. The book store of the museum have some interesting stuff for Gift's.",

          "This was the reason we went to Bologna. As you approach MAMbo you can see the huge pictures of Bowie outside and I got quite excited! We had Fast track tickets but on the day of opening we were disappointed that people with these were not the first to get in. However, once in I",
          "A friend of mine from Bologna told me about this museum, which is part of a vibrant area of the city which has repurposed old buildings for cultural purposes--the MAMbo, for instance, used to be a city bakery during WWI. Other spaces around the MAMbo are the Cineteca of Bologna,",
          "i notice that almost everyone has commented on the cafe and I'd agree - welcoming, good evening drinks and coffee / cake. We went there because we particularly wanted to see the Morandi (which is \"temporarily\" based here while the actual Morandi museum is being rescued). For",
          "Excellent Pasolini (film director) exhibition, whom I'd not heard of, but husband had. Morandi not particularly to my taste but I'm happy to look. You can elicit a smile from the staff! Lovely, uncrowded space to walk around and very pleasant bar and cafe.",
          "The best thing about this museum is its architecture - modern in a refined cement way. The contents? Well I'm told the locals are pleased, but I thought it was mostly a jumble. There were a couple of very interesting pieces and a whole lot of not interesting stuff. A whole",
          "Modern art is not my thing, but I enjoyed this. Staff happy to help if you showed an interest or asked. Nice bar too for aperitivo afterwards.",
          "Morandi might have the name but quality much overrated. Colours are not bright and do not show impressionist dynamics. And the majority is painted bottles. Not very impressive either. It shows if you are en vogue people declare you great. No need to go.",

          "The museum is placed in walking distance to the central train station. The Italian works were interesting and I enjoyed walking through the museum. A little bit getting used to were the security personnel of the museum. They were in almost every room sitting in their chairs and",
          "It's definitely not the Met or the Tate, but for a small place like Bologna, MAMbo does the job. It has a decent size collection of Italian modern art, as well as a collection of works by Morandi. The temporary exhibition during my visit featured Chinese artist Li Song Song,",
          "We enjoyed some of the works we viewed. They all seemed to be by Italian artists other than one by Bridget Reilly which was an interesting choice. The works by Morandi were interesting but there did seem an over abundance of attendants in this area.",
          "Worth to see, especially with Bologna Welcome Card (free). Nice presentation and some stunning rooms, i.e. Water room. Enjoyed by us and 14 months old toddler.",
          "MAMbo was a nice change from all the historical art we have been seeing while touring around. Some top post war Italian art. Allow 1-2 hours and don't miss the canal next to it.",
          "These spacious galleries contain a small number of items from the permanent collection. Also a commissioned and very boring video installation \"In Ritorno\". The Morandi collection is the principal reason to visit with a well presented number of his characteristic still life",
          "MAMbo showcases many pieces of Italian modern/contemporary art and it is a large and decent collection that can be viewed in a couple of hours.",
          "I was pretty excited about going to visit MAMbo, but felt rather disappointed when I got there. The permanent collection is very small and -- in my mind -- rather unimpressive. It focusses exclusively on Italian modern art, and also also only on a narrow time period. The special",
          "I would only half way recommend this museum for its art collection but the bad experiences I had there go beyond that. First of all, a guard felt that making lewd passes at me (suggestive looks, tone of voice, attracting my attention to something) was an ok use of his position.",
          "The lower gallery is has exhibits appearing for limited duration. When I visited, it was a focus on female artists and there were some very nice pieces. Overall, very good. The upper floors are the permanent collection and that part was also very good, but too limited and not",
          "The museum opens at noon, so no hurry! The collection is small and features local artists. Some interesting pieces and admission is included with the 20 euro museum pass.",
          "According to the Rough Guide this fairly new modern art museum aims to rival the Guggenheim or MOMA but they've got a long way to go before they get anywhere close! Although it has some interesting exhibits there aren't a huge number of them and nothing on a grand scale.",
          "It was OK. There was an interesting exhibition on the first floor, but the permanent one on the second floor had quite a few uninteresting pieces. If you've got nothing else to do, it's an OK way to kill an hour - but not a must if you have other tings on your menu. The building",
          "If you are modern art seeker. See it. It is local, you can follow Italian especially Bolognese artists. They have lots of events, nice cafe, good too feel it.",
          "It was OK, but I thought it lacked enough variety of pieces. There was one whole section of composition pieces that was just BORING. Gorgeous exhibition space - people skills at the museum seriously lacking effort.",
          "We had a great visit in Jan 13. We saw Mario Ceroli exhibition and it was mind blowingly good. The museum is a bit of a walk from the metro and the area feels a bit ghettoish, so suggest a daytime trip if you are the nervous type. No food in the area (other than the cafe which",

          "Our expectations were not very high as many of the reviews had been negative. We decided to visit this place as it was open all day on sunday and was not too far from our hotel and as a change from the old and traditional surroundings we visited diring the previous week. This",
          "It is really nice to see a collection of mostly Italian modern art when most tourist spend there time looking at the old. Great building, English information, nice collection. If your hungry go to Il Tartufo in the small street behind the museum via del Porto 34.",
          "MAMbo has a very attractive building in which the collection and special exhibitions are well presented. The space is airy, well lighted, and quite conducive to enjoying the art. MAMbo is unfortunately in a less interesting quarter of town, so although Bologna's excellent bus",
          "A very interesting collection of modern and contemporary art with a distinct Italian focus that's well worth the short detour from the main sites of Bologna. The Gattuso near the entrance is particularly impressive, as is the final room with later 20th century work.",
          "Museum has an excellent range of Italian modern art, including some fabulous oieces. It's not too huge, and very accessible. Highly recommended. Restaurant attached is also good.",
          "Expensive admission charge for a collection of art works by contemporary Italian artists, most of which I never heard of. The building itself is nice, but virtually none of the works was memorable.",
          "Gorgeous exhibition space, but the work in it was umm.... Well not my taste . I'm an artist and travel to see art regularly , esp. Contemporary art. I knew that Mambo had exhibited really amazing artists in the past , but the work on display during my visit was disappointing.",
          "Nice collection, nothing outstanding though, and even as artists, it was not worth going out of the way for, which we did. The museum it self is beautifully designed and the work is displayed quite nicely.",
          "Modern art museum housed in a converted industrial building. I just saw the permanent exhibition which was good but not exceptional.",
          "something a bit different from all the history that is Bologna. Housed in a beautiful building Mambo is a quirky collection of modern art. Although some of the in depth explanations (in english) of the various schools might leave the casual browser (like me) losing the will to",
          "had the so called 'aperitivo' there before dinner, the place very modern but nice, snacks served nothing special but the cocktails very good!! it,s a bit out of the center so if you stay in the old town there is a bit of walking to do to reach it.",
          "A lovely collection of modern art in a city that is sadly not blessed with a huge number or art exhibitions. If you can time your visit so that it coincides with the serving of early evening food and drinks in the adjacent caf\u00e9/bar, then it is well worth the effort!",
          "Loved the permanent collection, which is primarily focused on Italian contemporary artists. It was quite enlightening and delightful. The Morandi special exhibit was superb as was the Trisha Donnelly exhibit. The museum space itself is something definitely worthwhile seeing."

        "wiki": "Palazzo Re Enzo is a palace in Bologna, northern Italy. It takes  its name from Enzio of Sardinia, Frederick II's son, who was prisoner here from 1249 until his death in 1272.\nThe palace was built between 1244-1246 as an extension of the nearby Palazzo del Podest\u00e0, which had proven insufficient for the exigences of the Commune of Bologna. It was therefore initially known as Palatium Novum (\"New Palace\").\nThree years after the palace completion, Enzio was captured by the Guelphs at the Battle of Fossalta, and after a short stay in Anzola he was moved here, where he remained until his death. Enzio was allegedly left free within the palace by day, but by night he was kept into a cage hanging from the ceiling. He was also allowed to meet women: in his will he mentions three natural daughters, but a legend talks about a fourth son he had from a peasant, Lucia di Viadagola. The son was called Bentivoglio, from the words \"Amore mio, ben ti voglio\" that he said to his beloved (meaning \"My love, I'm fond of you\"), and he would be the ancestor of the Bentivoglio family, later rulers of Bologna.\nIn 1386 Antonio di Vincenzo finished the Sala dei Trecento (\"Hall of the Three-Hundred\"), which was to become the city's archive. The last floor was largely renovated in 1771 by Giovanni Giacomo Dotti. The current Gothic appearance dates from the restoration of 1905 due to Alfonso Rubbiani.\nOn the right of the palace is the access to the chapel of Santa Maria dei Carcerati, where the condemned to death went to. In the first floor was held the Carroccio and the war machines, while in the middle floor were the offices of the praetor and the chapel.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPaola Foschi and Francisco Giordano, ed.

        "wiki": "The Oratory of the Madonna of San Colombano, also called the Chiese di San Colombano e Santa Maria dell'Orazione is a religious site in central Bologna, found on Via Parigi #5, near the Bologna Cathedral.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe oratory was built in 1591, atop the site of a chapel or small church that sheltered the painting of the Madonna dell\u2019Orazione by Lippo di Dalmasio. The church, called San Colombano, at the site had been founded in the 7th century by Peter I, the bishop of Bologna and pupil of the Irish monk Columbanus. Columbanus had died in nearby Bobbio.\nThe annexed oratory contained a revered icon of the Virgin by Lippo Dalmasio as a main altarpiece. Starting about the year 1600, it was decorated by an impressive series of pupils of Ludovico Carracci, among them some of the titans of early Italian Baroque painting: Francesco Albani, Francesco Brizio, Domenichino, Lorenzo Garbieri, Lucio Massari, Guido Reni, and Baldassare Aloisi (il Balanino). The frescoes include scenes from the Passion and Resurrection of Christ.\nAmong the paintings listed by Malvasia in the Oratory are:\nLast Judgement (outside portico) by Pietro Pancotto\nSt Francis with angels above and demons below (right wall) by Antonio Caracci\nVirgin and Child with Joseph gathering dates by Leonello Spada\nSibyl (above side door) by Garbieri\nCoronation of St Catherine also by Garbieri\nSt Marta conversing with the Savior before whom the Magdalen is kneeling (vault) by Massari\nSibyl (over door) and Angel bearing the palm of martyrdom to St Ursula also by Massari\nInfant Jesus playing with St. John in the presence of little angels by Paolo CaracciIn the upper oratory, the frescoes include a St Peter going out weeping from Pilate\u2019s house by Francesco Albani.\nThe property now belongs to the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, and is being restored. Restorations have uncovered earlier 13th-century frescoes.The attached complex of buildings, since 2010, houses the collection of musical instruments donated by Luigi Ferdinando Tagliavini, consisting of nearly ninety pieces including harpsichords, spinets, pianofortes, clavichords and others. It also houses the musical library of Oscar Mischiati.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==",

          "unfortunately there was no water in the channel. albeit artificial water could be given to the channel.",
          "This would be lovely when the canal is full, however having visited today there is construction work ongoing at one of the buildings and as a result the canal has been drained, unsure how long this will go on for, but bear this in mind if planning a trip anytime soon.",
          "La Piccola Venezia is a tiny canal where you can ponder the life of the residents living close to the water. I loved the atmosphere on the spot and also enjoyed the many locks attached to the railing. The locks are placed there by lovers who lock in their love for each other.",
          "A little known fact about Bologna is its canals. There are about 60 kilometers of them. Today they are mostly unnoticeable because buildings were constructed over them. The canals were once important for the silk industry. From Via Piella you can find a small window to the",
          "Good photo op if you\u2019re passing but literally is a whole in the walk through which you see the view everyone else has posted. Nothing more.",
          "Little water flow in this canal, but interesting fact to know that these canals flourished in the twelfth century. Today, the underground canals keep the streets from flooding during heavy rains as was evident last week when rain poured off and on all day. We could step off a",
          "Bologna\u2019s historic center isn\u2019t all that big so you\u2019ll probably bump into it on your way somewhere else, in which case, stop for a quick look. It\u2019s interesting, kind of quaint view of Bologna\u2019s past, I wouldn\u2019t however recommend going out of your way just to see this",
          "We went for a walk and happened to find this. One of my party claimed how this was 'elusive' and 'hard to find'. I stated that I wasn't surprised because there wasn't much to see and really there isn't. It's not beautiful by any stretch. It is not a canal, it is basically a",
          "If you don't have much time, I don't suggest you go. Because it's not a very good place. There is a small, metal window on the side of the road. You can see the same view all over Italy. There are more important places to visit in Bologna. Unnecessary.",
          "La Piccola Venezia is on Via Piella, close to university area and a small window that you can see the hidden canal Canale delle Moline. When you are on the street it is difficult to miss the point because there are always people around taking pictures. Apart from the fact that",
          "A beautiful spot to visit, but it seems that this maintenance installations have been there for ever! A really unusual site..",
          "Very unfortunate, but some buildings under reconstruction and the scaffold overshooting all the beauty.",
          "This street is closed and you are not able to see it from regular street. We saw it from restaurant sa this was the only possibility.",
          "Whoever christened this Little Venice was surely having a laugh to see how many tourists would rush to visit it? I passed it on the way back to my hotel which was a street or so away. It\u2019s basically a view from a street bridge of a canal running between two tenement blocks, fine",
          "Definitely a curiosity in this city. For me, most of the \u201cfun\u201d in seeing the canal was just trying to find it \u2014 it\u2019s pretty well hidden behind the buildings, so I ended up circling around the streets for a while. Finding it was what made it worthwhile in my book; even the",
          "It did remind me of Venice without the gondola. Nothing much to see just trying to get to do as much as we can for a short period of stay in Bologna",
          "We were trying to get as much in as possible as short of time & this was an easy one as we could do it in passing, seeing it did remind me of Venice which was a nice vacation, so yeah I can see why this is called little Venice.",
          "If you have time for a little walk in Bologna, then i would recommend to put this in your route. It is a small adorable water canal, nothing too special, but worth a glance if in the area.",
          "It\u2019s very beautiful and charming. It\u2019s even more beautiful when there is more water. Interesting for taking pictures. :)",
          "What a surprise when you least expect it. The underground waterways of Bologna are evident here. Don't blink or you could miss it.",
          "Decided to find this on what was a rainy morning on our recent visit, don't really think it was worth it however. From one side you view it through a window in the wall which does if I am honest slightly resemble a Venice canal but not really a lot to see in probably not the",
          "It is highlighted on the map of the tourist office and it is fine to visit if you are nearby. The window is hard to find out at first and it is located next to a popular local restaurant. Standing in front of the window to have a glimpse of the small canal, one can imagine",
          "Have you been to Venice will this be kind of disappointing. I have seen other places called little venice, with canals that was more appealing. The only look to the canals is over a bridge and through a little window in the wall. Very little water in the canal. Are you in",
          "If you have time and wish to see old Bologna canals may looked before, go for it. The view from each side of the street is different with one side with a fence (locks included) and an explanation of the canal. The other offers a pleasant view of the local architecture. Still not",
          "I have to admit I was unaware that Bologna was connected to the Adriatic sea via a network on canals. Fascinating but only worth a cursory glance.",
          "I dont get the excitement over this gutter. You want Venezia go to Venezia, if you can't go at least visit Bruhes for an example. This narrow canal has nothing alike with Venezia. What full of crap",
          "Once Bologna was connected to the Adriatic through a series of canals. and the River Reno. Over the years the passage silted up and the city filled in the waterways to make streets (hence vis Rio di Reno). But little glimpses like this remind you of the extraordinary history",
          "We always remembered this part of Bologna and were keen to see if it was as we remembered and it was! Beautiful to see it again.",
          "It is one of the very few remaining canals of Bologna. It is very small and really nothing special. It's not hard to find, getting there takes about 15 minutes from the centre.",
          "Do nit miss this one, it can be mistaken with Venezia. Such a surprise in a middle of the city. IF you are not planning a visit to Venezia is the best place to stretch imagination what you are missing. Picture perfect place",
          "Bologna is small city but it is full of surprises. La Piccola Venezia is one the 7 secrets of bologna. You can take photos with the only canale of the city",
          "Don't miss it, specially if your trip doesn't take you to Venice! Such a wonderful hidden corner of the city.",
          "Make sure you find this street. Definitely worth a stop to admire and take a picture. Very Venice like. A beautiful find in Bologna",
          "This is quite a surprise in the city, very \"Venice\", and alot of history surrounding the movement of goods visa the canal, and a very small door in the wall to view this through which was unique.",
          "A little hole in the wall looking down the stream that runs under the city. Next door is a great restaurant - Trattoria dal Biasssanot",
          "It's not cute or worth lookin at. We arrived and the water was like a stream, it looked like the back alley between houses full of waste water. Nothing like Venice at all",
          "This is one street in Bologna you will miss if you are not looking for it and its a picturesque opportunity!",
          "Few remaining canals in Bologna but there is a window and view to see one. Looks just like Venice, but you cannot travel or walk there anymore as it isn't safe.",
          "Beautiful canal, specially in the mornings! But this palace is more of a little surprise for the newcomers in the city rather than a city sightseeing. If you have already been to Venice, you can totally skip this place! if you have little time in Bologna, skip this place again!",
          "Pretty little canal to view a little bit of history in Bologna. Not too far out of the way from Via dell'Indipendenza. Certainly a photo opportunity.",
          "La Piccola Venezia is very close to the center city, but is can easily be overlooked if you are not informed of its existence. It really deserves to be seen, it is like an instantaneous time voyage to a couple of centuries ago.",
          "As this place was very close to our hotel, we went there every day to see if the view changed with any water in it but unfortunately the canal was completely empty. Unless you are staying close by, I would not bother to come here especially for this view.",
          "Bologna used to have many channels, almost like Venice: When I read about Little Venice I imagined something a little more exciting than a small window overlooking a street that may or may not be filled with water. In my case, I wasn't lucky. Don't make it a point to go, unless",
          "This is called little Venice and it it little. Whilst walking around it is easy to miss but makes a nice photo. It is off the main shopping street",
          "Worth a look as on the back route by some lovely restaurants and bars. Makes a lovely picture and bizarre how the canal runs like it dies through town.",
          "As this is close to all the important attractions of Bologna it's worth while diverting off the main street to see this view which exactly matches all the daytime pictures you see.",
          "I would not go out of my way to see this but interesting if you are in the area.Not far off the main central areas.",
          "We loved tis and had to google map it to see where to go but good old Google took us right there and we had walked very near this so often without realising it was right there! We loved this little window and be careful on the google map when you click on the icon it says",
          "Built several kilometeres from the river , Bologna was originally fed by many canals which brought water and transport to the town. Most have been built on over the years and still exist but are underground. This is the only one left and is viewable from the Via Pielli.",
          "When people in Bologna tell you that you have to see the window on the canal, you're wondering if they're pulling your leg. They're not. There is actually a little window, in a wall, on a street, opening on a canal. It's really charming, and well worth the 5 minutes of your time",
          "Basically this is a couple of small windows where you can see a small canal running through the centre of the city with house and businesses backing right on to it . They call it Little Venice and you can see the comparison . Nice little view but you will only need a few minutes",
          "La Piccola Venezia is a little bit of Venice in Bologna. It is the remained canals which used to lead to Venice. The canals made the city a great commercial centre.",
          "Ok, it is not a big canal and it is not Venice. But it is only a 10 minutes walk from whenever you may be in Bologna so, just go there and see it... It worths the 5 minutes of your time!",
          "This attraction was a bit low on my list of must-sees, but since I noticed it was near my hotel, I thought I'd give it a look on my way back late in the afternoon. It's a stretch to call it \"Little Venice\" (Venetians would probably have a good laugh!), but this canal running at",
          "Worth a look if near by , standing on the road looking sideways through a gap in the houses you realise you are on a bridge , you will see 200m of canal , that's it , no start no end . weird !",
          "There is a small side road in Bologna that has a window overlooking a small side road in Venice. This attraction is small and non-interactive, but the place is truly lovable. Nighttime presents a different type of atmosphere.",
          "In the middle of bologna you will find a small canal that wasn't covered by buildings or streets. It is interesting to give a quick look while in the city center.",
          "We decided to visit a restaurant and by chance we were sitting just beside the window. It's easy to miss but you can always say you have seen a sort of Venice",
          "an interesting and odd little glorified sewer. makes for a few good images. otherwise do not walk out of your way.",
          "You need to look on the map to work out where the canal can be seen. It is well worth a detour to have a look and get some Venice like photos.",
          "Hard to understand why this makes it into the guide books, actually. The section of canal you can see is a scuzzy waterway which makes the Mersey in Stockport seem attractive. Have a look on your way past but don't go out of your way.",
          "So many people don't know this exisits - OK so it's not Venice but it is still an important link with the past history of the city. It's well worth taking the time to wander the streets to find ;the window' or stand on the little bridge where you can look out onto this canal as",
          "see the entry for Finestra sui Canali on this very, very, very little Venice, just a small leftover of the ancient waterways.",
          "Fun to see in passing, but this really is just a canal - mind you, no idea where it went, it just disappeared under a house!",
          "Seeing the canal running under Bologna was a reminder of how close we were to Venice and the incredible history of that part of Italy.",
          "It's nice to look at, with a full bridge parapet on one side, and a small hole in a wall on the other. People being people, guess which is more popular!",
          "Via Piella was not far from where we were staying and as we walked down the street there was a crowd queuing to see. An open orange window in the wall made a picture perfect vow of the small canal as it flowed between the buildings. We got a great photo.",
          "Nothing much to see. Its a water stream that looks like little Venice but it might you might be disappointed because its not that great.",
          "If you have seen Venice, you understand that it isn't equal. But it is interesting to see a river in window on Via Piella street...",
          "Very strange spectacle, worth seeing. Truth be told, it's nothing special, but the surprise of the sight is what makes it worth your time. Also, nice architecture of surrounding buildings... If you have time, don't miss it.",
          "The hidden canals of Bologna In days gone by Bologna, like many other European cities, had a network of canals. Most of the waterways were covered over in the 1950s and 60s to make way for new car parks and buildings but there are a couple of places where they are still open to",

        "wiki": "The Pepoli are an aristocratic banking family of Bologna, in northern Italy. They were lords of the city for thirteen years in the fourteenth century.\nA branch of the family moved to Trapani in Sicily and were granted several feudal lordships and baronies.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe presence of the family in Bologna seems to have been documented since the last decade of the eleventh century. The testament of Romeo Pepoli's Zerra, written by Rolandino de 'Passaggeri on 8 October 1251, shows the presence of the family in the area of via Castiglione at that time. From the beginning, the Pepoli had established a prominent banking house in Bologna and became among the richest families in Italy at that time. For this reason, the chessboard used to count the relationship between different coins was adopted as the family's coat of arms. After years of private financial activity, the family eventually took a leading role in the political scene of the city.\n\n\n=== Lordship of Bologna ===\nThe House of Pepoli reached its apogee in the first half of the 14th century. The family took power as Lords of Bologna during the chaotic struggles between Guelfs and Ghibellines in the city. In August, 1337, Taddeo Pepoli orchestrated an armed occupation of the city and gained support for his election as Lord of Bologna. While initially reluctant to acknowledge Pepoli, Pope Benedict XII sent the bishop of Como, a Parravicini, to the city. The papal nuncio delivered  the keys of the city to Taddeo, appointing him papal vicar for a three-year term. With this title Taddeo obtained the legitimacy to his office. These episodes are commemorated in two ovals frescoed in the 17th century by Canuti in the stairwell entrance of the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande, across the street from the Palazzo Pepoli Vecchio.\nTheir seat in the city was Palazzo Pepoli Vecchio, constructed by Taddeo Pepoli. The Pepoli maintained dynastic alliances through well-considered marriages: Obizzo III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, married Jacopa Pepoli in 1317 and the condottiero Roberto Alidosi, papal vicar and lord of Imola, was given Giacoma Pepoli. The commune of Castiglione dei Pepoli in the Italian Province of Bologna still bears the family's name.\n\n\n=== 15th and 16th Centuries ===\nAfter the rule of Taddeo Pepoli (1337-1347), Bologna fell to the Visconti of Milan. While Cardinal Gil de Albornoz forcibly returned the city to the papal orbit in 1360, the Pepoli never regained their former civic power.\nThe family remained prominent landowners. Guido Pepoli  was ordained cardinal by Pope Sixtus V in 1589. The imposing Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande was commissioned in 1653 by the newly minted Senator Odoardo Pepoli; the architects were Giovanni Battista Alberoni and Giuseppe Antonio Torri. Today it houses the Baroque works once in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna.\nA later member of the family, conte Carlo Pepoli, wrote Vincenzo Bellini's libretto for I Puritani and provided the lyrics for Rossini's song \"La Danza\". To him Giacomo Leopardi dedicated one of his canti.\n\n\n=== House of Bonaparte ===\nNapoleone Gioacchino Pepoli was a senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Mayor of Bologna, and Italian envoy to Russia. Moreover, he was also a grand-nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte through his mother, Princess Louisa Julie Caroline Murat the daughter of Prince Joachim Murat - Napoleon's brother-in-law.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

It was not used much until 1674, when the long Portico di San Luca was built from the center of town to the Basilica della Beata Vergine di San Luca, used in yearly procession of an icon. From then on it became also known as the \u201cPorta Sacra\u201d or the \u201cPorta dei pellegrini\u201d (Holy Gate and Gate of Pilgrims) for its placement in the route towards the Sanctuary of San Luca.\nIn 1859, concordant with a rising movement to restore medieval remnants in Italian cities, the architect Giuseppe Mengoli, replaced the mediaeval cassero with the present one by connecting it with two crenellated arches to the two lateral cylindrical great towers, giving it its present castle-like form.About nine of the original twelve gates remain in the third set of circumvallating 14th-century walls (Cerchia del Mille) of Bologna. These include the Porta Maggiore (or Mazzini), Porta Castiglione, Porta Saragozza (this article), Porta San Felice, Porta delle Lame, Porta Galliera, Porta Mascarella, Porta San Donato, and Porta San Vitale.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Giovanni Capellini (23 August 1833 \u2013 28 May 1922) was an Italian geologist and paleontologist. \nHe was a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy in the seventeenth legislature.\n\n\n== Birth and education ==\nGiovanni Capellini was born on 23 August 1833 in La Spezia, Liguria, son Pietro Francesco Capellini and Margherita Ferrarini.\nHis family originated in Porto Venere.\nHis parents intended that he should make a career as a musician, and then in the church.\nAs a boy he collected interesting natural objects.\nIn 1853 the future King Umberto I of Italy visited La Spezia, and Capellini was presented to him when he came to view the collection.  \nLater Umberto called Capellini his oldest friend.Capellini remained in the monks' school until his father died in 1854.\nTo make a living he worked as a bookbinder, a teacher in a college of La Spezia and a manufacturer of electrical equipment.\nHe was finally able to devote himself to geology thanks to the Rector of the Seminary of Pontremoli, who offered him the post of prefect at the seminary, \nand he continued his studies thanks to the Municipality of La Spezia, which paid for his costs at the University of Pisa. \nAfter graduating he embraced the profession of a geologist, and began his exploratory research on the Apuan Alps.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nCapellini's work was quickly appreciated in the academic world. \nHe went to France to further his studies. \nOn his return to Italy in 1860 he was appointed professor of natural history in the National College of Genoa, a position he held for a short time before being appointed Professor of Geology at the University of Bologna the next year.  He was to hold this position for over sixty years. \nOn this fiftieth anniversary as a teacher at Bologna he donated his huge collection of specimens from Europe and North America to the Museum of Geology of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute.From 1858, Capellini spent most of his holidays in research and meetings in other European countries, including France, Switzerland, Romania, Turkey, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Greece, and Hungary.\nCapellini's easy access to the Savoy royal family bought him access to the royalty of other European countries, \nwhich was to greatly help him in his work.\nIn 1863 Capellini went to the United States and Canada, travelling in Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario and in the United States as far west as Nebraska, where he made his first true geological excavations.  He was particularly impressed by the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C..\nHe made many contacts and friends on this visit, as he had in Europe, which he was to use in his mission establishing international cooperation between geologists, including the exchange of comparative samples. Capellini was a supporter of Darwinism.Starting with the 2nd Congress of Naturalists, held in La Spezia in 1865, Capellini led a series of international scientific congresses. \nIn 1876 he was a member of the founding committee of the International Geological Congress.\nCapellini was several times rector of the University of Bologna, and initiated the Geological Map of Italy project. \nFrom 1883 he was often President of the Italian Geological Society.  \nHe was also a member of the Accademia dei Lincei and many other societies.\nHe died on 28 May 1922 in Bologna.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nCapellini received many honors:\nGrand'Ufficiale dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia\nCommendatore dell'Ordine dei Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro\nCommendatore dell'Ordine del Salvatore (Regno di Grecia)\nCommendatore dell'Ordine di San Giacomo della Spada (Portogallo)\nCommendatore dell'Ordine del Dannebrog (Danimarca)\nCommendatore dell'Ordine della Stella Polare (Svezia)\nCavaliere di IV classe dell'Ordine di Medjidi\u00e9 (Impero ottomano)\nCavaliere dell'Ordine della Legion d'Onore (Francia)\nCavaliere dell'Ordine della Rosa (Brasile)\nCavaliere dell'Ordine dell'Immacolata Concezione di Vila Vi\u00e7osa (Portogallo)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nExternal links",

        "wiki": "The Basilica of San Giacomo Maggiore is an historic Roman Catholic church in Bologna, region of Emilia Romagna, Italy, serving a monastery of Augustinian friars. It was built starting in 1267 and houses, among the rest, the Bentivoglio Chapel, featuring numerous Renaissance artworks.\n\n\n== History ==\nA community of hermits founded by the Blessed John the Good of Modena had established itself near the walls of Bologna, along the Savena river, as early as 1247. They founded a monastery with its church, dedicated to St. James the Greater (Italian: San Giacomo Maggiore). The hermits were merged in 1256 by the pope with other eremetical communities of the region to form the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine, with one of their number being elected the first Prior General of the new Order. As they then needed a larger religious complex within the walls, in 1267 construction was undertaken of the new church in the present location. The edifice was finished in 1315, but its consecration took place in 1344, with the completion of the apse section. The church, built in sober Romanesque style (with some Gothic elements such as the ogival windows), had a single nave with visible trusses and ended with a polygonal apse-chapel and two square chapel. \nIn the 15th century the Bentivoglio family built their family chapel in the church (1463\u20131468), and also added a long portico on the Via San Donato (1477\u20131481). Across the church is the flank of the 1560 Palazzo Malvezzi de' Medici, Bologna. In 1471 the bell tower was raised and, from 1483 to 1498, the interior was largely renovated with a new cover and a dome. New chapels were created in the side walls, which were eventually decorated with Renaissance and Baroque altars and paintings.\nThe Augustinian friars were expelled during the French occupation in the early 19th century. They returned in 1824, although part of the monastery remained a music school, now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini. With the anti-clerical laws again suppressing religious orders legislated by the new Kingdom of Italy, the friars gave up the monastery, keeping only possession of the church.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe facade is the  oldest part of the church, with its late-Romanesque proportions. The decorations in Istrian stone on the ogival windows, in Venetian style, were added by Lombardy masters in 1295. The four funerary cells were added in the early 14th century, shortly after those in the portico, which date to the 13th century and had frescoes (now inside the church); the original entrance protyrus was modified in the same period.\n\nThe portico, traditionally attributed to Tommaso Filippi, had 36 Corinthian columns. The entablature has a frieze. The portico also gives access to two cloisters, one from the 15th and another the 16th century. The complex is bounded by the only surviving section of Bologna's 11th-century walls. Next to them is the Oratory of Santa Cecilia within the monastery cloister. The oratory includes frescoed panels by the Renaissance painters Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa, and Amico Aspertini. The 15th-century portico built by the Bentivoglio family and the bell tower.\nThe church has a Renaissance dome designed by Antonio Morandi.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe interior has Renaissance and Baroque decorations. The vaults have frescoes executed in 1495 by Francia and Lorenzo Costa's workshops. There are numerous chapels: the main ones include the Poggi Chapel, with artworks by Pellegrino Tibaldi, and the Bentivoglio Chapel.\n\n\n==== Bentivoglio Chapel ====\nThis element of the basilica was designed by Pagno di Lapo Portigiani (1463\u20131468). It has a majolica pavement by the Della Robbia workshop (1498), with traces of the Bentivoglio coat of arms. The painted decoration was executed by Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and includes the Bentivoglio Altarpiece. The altarpiece is by Francesco Raibolini (c. 1494). The tomb of Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio was sculpted by Jacopo della Quercia in 1438.\n\n\n==== Poggi Chapel ====\nThis chapel was built by Cardinal Giovanni Poggi (1493-1556), a native of the city, who is buried in it. Poggi met Pellegrino Tibaldi, also a native of Bologna, after the painter had moved to Rome in 1547, and later commissioned him to paint the Palazzo Poggi in their hometown. Tibaldi returned to the city in 1555 and painted frescoes for the cardinal in both his palace and the family chapel. This work is considered Tibaldi's masterpiece. In this chapel there are two portraits by Tibaldi of the cardinal, one on each side of the altar. The one on the left shows him as papal nuncio to Spain, while the one on the right shows him later in his career, as a cardinal.\n\n\n==== Other ====\nOther artworks include Polyptych of the Holy Cross Relic by Paolo Veneziano, a Virgin in Glory by Bartolomeo Cesi (late 16th century), and an early 15th-century late Gothic crucifix in the Malvezzi Chapel.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRaule, Angelo (1999).

        "wiki": "The Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica is a music museum and music library in the Palazzo Aldini Sanguinetti, in the historic center of Bologna, Italy.\n\n\n== Museum ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 to hold the city's collection of musical objects. It was renamed Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica in 2004 when the museum's current site, the Palazzo Sanguinetti, opened to the public. The palace was reopened after a long and careful restoration that brought the rich, interior frescoes back to their original splendour. These frescoes were first completed between the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and provide one of the finest examples of Napoleonic and Neoclassical decoration.\nThe purpose of the museum was to make the public aware of the rich musical heritage owned by the Comune di Bologna. Until recently, much of this heritage remained confined in warehouses \u2013 primarily due to lack of adequate space \u2013 and was only brought out occasionally for temporary display.\nPalazzo Sanguinetti offered the possibility to enhance the cultural value of such precious musical heritage and to provide an environment worthy of the priceless items displayed. The palace also guarantees ideal conditions for managing and conserving these items.\nThe institute is now divided into two sites. An ample selection of volumes, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the museum halls in Strada Maggiore 34 (Palazzo Sanguinetti), while the majority of bibliographic material is accessible in Piazza Rossini 2 (the ex-Convent of San Giacomo) in rooms attached to the G.B. Martini Conservatory of Music.\n\n\n==== The Palazzo Sanguinetti ====\nIn the early 16th century, the original core of the Palazzo Sanguinetti belonged to the Loiani family. The building was sold in 1569 to the Bolognese brothers, Ercole and Giulio Riario, who were originally from Savona and were related to the della Roveres. Having acquired neighboring land and buildings, Senator Ercole Riario had the home reconstructed and enlarged. The individual homes were united into one structure, and construction on the impressive staircase, which still characterizes the building today, was likely begun. The second major reconstruction was commissioned by Count Antonio Aldini, to whom the Marquis Raffaello Riario Sforza had granted a long-term lease in 1796. Count Aldini tasked the architect Giovanni Battista Martinetti (1774\u20131830) with modernizing the building. A neighboring house was attached to the tower belonging to the Oseletti family, and the huge 16th-century hall was divide into two rooms, which correspond to the modern museum's two most spacious rooms \u2013 the vestibule, or the Room of Virtues, and the Ballroom.\nFollowing the fall of Napoleon and the economic ruin of Aldini, the palace was sold to the Cuban nobleman don Diego Pegnalverd, a former member of the Napoleonic government. Upon his death in 1832, the palazzo passed to the famous tenor, Domenico Donzelli. It is noted that Gioachino Rossini stayed there while his own nearby home was under reconstruction. In 1870 the Sanguinetti family purchased the building. They were responsible for the most recent decorations in the intended library and the \u201cEgyptian Room.\u201d During recent renovations of the palazzo, marvelous frescoes were discovered in these two areas.\nIn 1986 the last heiress, Eleonora Sanguinetti, donated the larger part of the building to the Comune di Bologna in memory \u2013 as she wrote in her will \u2013 of \u201cmy unforgettable father, Dr. Guido Sanguinetti. I wanted to donate the building in Strada Maggiore 34 in his name and memory, and for the love that he always had for his city and his home, so that it could become a music museum and library.\u201d\n\n\n=== The frescos and decorations ===\nThe Palazzo Sanguinetti decorations displays works by major 18th- and 19th-century Neoclassical painters, such as Pelagio Palagi (1777\u20131860), Serafino Barozzi, and Antonio Basoli (1774\u20131848), under the direction of Vincenzo Martinelli (1737\u20131807). On the ground floor, the landscape fresco (a magnificent trompe-l'oeil perspective) is attributed to Luigi Busatti, while the quadratura is the work of Francesco Santini (1763\u20131840). Santini, with the probable collaboration of Serafino Barozzi (1735\u20131810), also decorated the walls of the grand staircase. On the first floor, the Woodland Room (Room 1), used as and called the Banquet Room, was designed by Martinelli: he illustrates landscapes rich with greenery and classical architecture in the distance. These classical elements surround the onlooker in the illusion of a step that supports hermes and statues of Bacchus and Ceres, works by a young Palagi.  The Aeneas Room (Room 2), also by Palagi, depicts stories of the Aeneid on a black, Etruscan background. The Zodiac and Aurora Room (Room 3) depicts the Zodiac signs by Domenico Corsini (1774\u20131814) and a figure of Aurora, attributed to Palagi. The last small room of the east wing (Room 4) is decorated by artists from the Barozzi workshop.  They are also credited with the two rooms (Rooms 6 and 7) that conclude the west wing, which are decorated in oriental style with curtains and pavilions, exotic plants, and feminine figures with small umbrellas. Room 5 is the Ballroom. At the end of the museum tour are two salons in the apartment designed by Aldini; they were the first two rooms to be decorated. The original room (Room 8), is decorated by Antonio Basoli in a neo-gothic style, with figures, statues, and bass reliefs by Pietro Fancelli (1764\u20131850).\n\n\n==== Father Giovanni Battista Martini ====\n\nThe original core of the museum's musical collections is credited to the Conventual Franciscan friar, Giovanni Battista Martini (Bologna, April 24, 1706 \u2013 August 3, 1784), important 18th-century music scholar and collector, a theorist and composer, and a teacher of counterpoint. Johann Christian Bach and Wolfgang Amad\u00e9 Mozart were among his students.\nAt only 19 years old, Martini was appointed chapel-master of the Church of San Francesco in Bologna. His fame as an excellent teacher and connoisseur of music began to grow when he \u201cwon\u201d a dispute with the scholar, Redi, regarding the interpretation of a mysterious canone dell'Animuccia that existed in the choir gallery of the Santa Casa di Loreto, where Redi himself was chapel-master. After this triumph, not content with being only a scholar, he continued his music studies and was an admired composer of sonatas for the harpsichord, canons, and about 500 unpublished musical pieces.\nThe numerous letters conserved in the library (around 80 volumes with more than 6,500 letters), document the broad network of musicians, aristocrats, singers, and cardinals who had contacts with Martini. Even the Emperor of Austria visited Padre Martini while in Bologna. Martini collected not only manuscripts and musical works of various kinds, but also portraits of musicians displayed on the walls of his library in the Monastery of San Francesco.\n\n\n=== Exhibition path ===\n\nThe museum path opens among the lush decorations of the Boschereccia Room with some symbolic works which serve as an introduction to the museum and prepare the visitor for their trip through the musical universe.\nRooms 2 and 3 are dedicated to the spiritual father of the new museum, pictured in an oval by Angelo Crescimbeni: Giambattista Martini, whose priceless moral heritage, both intellectual and material, is celebrated here and made known to the greater public.\n\nIn Room 3, the relationships between Padre Martini and the stand-out personalities of the music world of the time, such as the young Mozart or Johann Christian Bach, who is represented in the famous portrait by Gainsborough, are displayed. In the same room, one can also admire the famous Sportelli di libreria musicale by Giuseppe Maria Crespi.Room 4 (\u201cThe Idea of Music\u201d) follows, which is dedicated to the musical scholars from the 15th century to the 17th century, with important examples of musical treatises, and portraits of their respective authors. This room also contains some musical instruments of great importance, like the unique omnitonum harpsichord  by Vito Trasuntino (Venice 1606).\nSome of the more relevant pieces are on display in the following Room 5 (Arts Room), which is dedicated to the \u201cBooks for music and instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries.\u201d In this room, rare texts from ranging the 15th century to the famous Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, the first printed musical book by Ottaviano Petrucci, can be admired. They are kept inside very modern, circular cases in the center of the room, which match the rich decoration of the floors.\nThen there are the instruments: lutes; the harmony of flutes by Manfredo Settala of 1650, which represents a real unicum;\nthe pochette, various little violins used as instruments by dance instructors, the ghironde, the serpentoni, the extraordinary series of horns and cornets from the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally, a unique performance instrument: the tiorba, which is in the shape of a khit\u00e1ra.\nItalian opera is the focus of the following room.\nThe 18th century are first in Room 6, dedicated to the famous singer Carlo Broschi, known as Farinelli.\nHis beautiful portrait, painted by Corrado Giaquinto, dominates the room, together with the portraits of the castrati from various periods and of composers from the time, such as Antonio Vivaldi and Domenico Cimarosa.\nRoom 7 places the visitor in the 19th century with Gioachino Rossini, whose name is forever tied to Bologna. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first recitals of Isabella Colbran, a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of The Barber of Seville and some rather curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by Camille Pleyel.\nThe path proceeds through the centuries, the musical uses, and styles in Room 8, which is dedicated to \u201cBooks for music and instruments in the 18th and 19th centuries.\u201d There are viole d'amore and flutes along with the original scores composed by Torelli, Vivaldi, Bertoni, etc. There are also clarinets and the beautiful Buccin, created in Lyon by Jean Baptiste Tabard (1812\u20131845).\nConcluding the exhibit, Room 9 pays a proper tribute to two important people in the Italian and Bolognese musical culture, Giuseppe Martucci and Ottorino Respighi.  This room displays the composer's portraits, photographs, and a selection of works from the Respighi property, which were donated to the library in 1961 by his widow, Elsa, for the 25th anniversary of his death. In the same room lies the portrait of the musician Arrigo Serato, painted by the famous artist Felice Casorati.\n\n\n=== Collections ===\nThe first floor of the Palazzo is home to the nine rooms of the exhibition, which illustrates about six centuries of the history of European music. There are over one hundred paintings of famous people from the music world, which are a part of the picture gallery started by Padre Giovanni Battista Martini, more than eighty antique musical instruments, and a large selection of valuable historical documents, such as treatises, volumes, opera libretti, letters, manuscripts, original musical scores, etc.\n\n\n== Library ==\n\nThe collection inherited from Padre Martini constitutes one of the most prestigious collections of music repertory printed between the 16th and 18th centuries because of its incunabulums, valuable manuscripts, opera libretti, and for the unique collection of autographs and letters, which are the result of the correspondence Martini painstakingly kept with eminent people, scholars, and musicians of the time.\nSaved from the Napoleonic confiscations  due to the intervention of Stanislao Mattei, Martini's disciple and successor, the valuable bibliographic patrimony was donated to the Liceo musicale di Bologna in 1816. The Liceo had been founded in 1804 at the ex-convent of the Agostinians in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. The library grew considerably throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, thanks to the amount of materials produced from the didactic activity of the Liceo (famous students of the Liceo included Rossini, Donizetti, and Respighi and directors Mancinelli, Martucci, and Busoni).\nThe library also grew because of the valuable items and rare volumes that were acquired by Gaetano Gaspari, who was appointed as librarian in 1855.\nGaspari directed the library for many years with a unique zeal and knowledge. After many years of hard work and constant effort, he was able to excellently organize and card-catalogue all the library material (also from this period came the posthumous publication, the \"Library Catalogue of the Liceo Musicale di Bologna\", which bears his name and is now also available online).\nIn 1942, when the Liceo musicale was transformed into a state institution \u2013 Regio Conservatorio di Musica \u2013 the Comune di Bologna chose to maintain ownership of Padre Martini's bibliographic patrimony and the attached picture gallery.\nThe Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 in order to conserve and make the most of the bibliographic patrimony and portrait gallery.\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\nThere is not much information about the development of the picture gallery, which seems to have had no rivals in Bologna during the 18th century. From the valuable letters of correspondence that Padre Martini kept with different well-known people of the time (for example, musicians that were his students in Bologna, members of the Accademia Filarmonica, music theorists, composers, nobles, illustrious intellectuals, chapel masters, and custodians of Franciscan convents), it is evident that there was a complex network of informers and intermediaries that were responsible for finding the portraits he desired.\nMany of the portraits were commissioned to the artists directly by Padre Martini. The painters drew the features of the musicians from engravings of the time. In reality, he wasn't interested in the artistic worth of the paintings as much as their plausible resemblance to the model. He was also more interested in whether they were in harmony with his century's interest in the physiognomic reading of faces with the intention of giving iconographic testimony of the people bonded by one common denominator \u2013 music. It was also important that the paintings had a direct relationship with his Library.\nIt's worth noting that there are many paintings by famous artists present in the collection, including the portrait of Farinelli by Corrado Giaquinto, the portrait of Johann Christian Bach by Gainsborough, and one of Charles Burney by Joshua Reynolds.\nIt also seems that the prestige of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable European expert on the art of music, was so great that it was important for a musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.\nThe picture gallery remained in the convent of San Francesco even after Martini's death, surviving the Napoleonic confiscations thanks to Martini's successor, Padre Stanislao Mattei. Only in 1801 was it transferred to the ex-convent of the Agostinians at the Chiesa di San Giacomo Maggiore. Today, the collection consists of 319 paintings, the majority of which are oil on canvas with some pastels and drawings.\n\n\n=== The collection of musical instruments ===\nThe musical instruments displayed in the rooms of the museum originate from the collections of two important Bolognese institutions: the Museo Civico Medievale and the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. The core of this collection from the Museo Civico Medievale comes from the Liceo musicale, which was founded in 1804. As Federico Parisini (the Liceo librarian from 1881 to 1891) explained, following the Napoleonic suppressions, \u201cthe instruments, many famous musical works, chorus books, rare instruments, and other items related to music were sold publicly.\u201d\nThe central administration of the Dipartimento del Reno had asked the government of the Repubblica Cisalpina to purchase and conserve the objects that risked being dispersed. The recovered instruments were then entrusted to the Liceo and, in 1881, were finally added to the Museo Civico Medievale, where they have remained until today.\nAmong the most valuable instruments now displayed in the rooms of the museum is the Trasuntino harpsichord of 1606 (displayed in Room 4). It was constructed for Camillo Gonzaga, the Count of Novellara, and afterwards was passed to Giuseppe Baini (1775\u20131844), the celebrated author of the first biography of Palestrina. In his will, Baini bequeathed the harpsichord to the Liceo Musicale. Other valuable instruments on display are the Trasuntino monochord, which was built to tune the cymbal, and the 5-reed flute, which is able to mimic several flutes playing in harmony. There is also the polyphonic flute (displayed in Room 5), which bears the mark of Manfredo Settala (1600\u20131680), a Milanese rector, who was a great collector and famous personality in the cultural panorama of the 17th century.\nThe origin of the collection of musical instruments in the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale is more uncertain. The collection includes some particularly important models, such as eight pianos, five of which are grand pianos and three of which are rectangular. These pianos date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Among these are the priceless Erard from 1811 (that possibly belonged to Paolina Borghese), which was restored for the inauguration of the museum and is now exhibited in Room 8. Also included are Gioachino Rossini's Pleyel piano of 1844 (exhibited in Room 7), and the so-called \u201cspinette of Padre Martini\u201d, a rectangular Glonner from 1780 (displayed in Room 3). Other important instruments on display are the Heckelphon of 1900 (Room 8), various English horns, some cornets, and two oboes.\n\n\n=== Services ===\nMuseum\n\nLaboratory\nAudioguide\nBookshop\nCoatroom\nMinibarLibrary\nThough it is to be transferred to a new site, the library is located in Piazza Rossini 2. It is made up of a single reading room, which is shared with the Conservatorio di Musica \u201cG.B. Martini\u201d. The room has 20 seats, twelve of which are exclusively reserved for the consultation of antique and particular texts.

        "wiki": "The Arco del Meloncello is an 18th-century Rococo structure in Bologna, that forms a pedestrian portico over the road (hence an arch); it is part of the Portico di San Luca, a long arcade that sheltered the walk from the Cathedral of Bologna to the hillside Sanctuary of San Luca, Bologna. It lies beyond the gates of the Porta Saragozza, outside the former city walls of Bologna.\nThe arch solved the problem of a site where two roads intersected at right angles, and allowed the foot traffic of the pilgrims to proceed above the road, Via Saragozza, uninterrupted. The architect was Carlo Francesco Dotti won the commission during a competition in 1714, and created the scenographic arrangement with the help of Francesco Galli Bibiena during 1721 to 1732. In the early twentieth century, in a project supervised by Tito Azzolino, the arch was raised a few meters to allow passage of a train underneath.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Bologna tramway network (Italian: Rete tranviaria di Bologna) was an important part of the public transport network of Bologna, Italy. It was established in 1880 and discontinued in 1963.On March 7, 2019, the mayor of Bologna revealed city plans to build a new tramway network. Construction is proposed to begin in 2022 with the first line expected to be operational by January 2026.\n\n\n== Future network (2026?) ==\nThe reintroduction of a tram network in Bologna is foreseen by the Piano Urbano della Mobilit\u00e0 Sostenibile (PUMS, Italian for Urban Sustainable Mobility Plan), adopted on 27 November 2018. Bologna's PUMS plans the progressive replacement of the main urban bus and trolley lines by tram lines, to be implemented in two steps:\n\nconstruction of the first tramway line (red line), from Borgo Panigale to CAAB, via Bologna Centrale railway station\nprogressive construction of three further lines, formed as the combination of the radial branches of the current main bus and trolley lines: Casalecchio Garibaldi station-San Lazzaro di Savena station (blue line), Bologna Corticella station-Due Madonne/Via Larga (green line), Casteldebole railway station-Rastignano railway station (yellow line).As of February 2019, the technical and economic feasibility study for the first line is officially underway, by a temporary association of companies formed by Systra, Sotecni, Architecna, Studio Mattioli, Aegis and Cooperativa Archeologia.The timetable announced by the town administration for line 1 is as follows:\n2019: information and involvement activities to support the construction of the tramway line\nAutumn 2019: approval of the technical and economic feasibility project\nSummer 2020: approval of the final project\nSummer 2021: approval of the executive project\nBy December 2021: awarding of works\nJanuary 2022: start of the works\nJanuary 2026: start of the tramway line.\n\n\n=== Line 1 ===\nLine 1 will have its western terminus at Borgo Panigale Terminal, where a 400-car parking lot is planned, joined with an interchange terminal with intercity bus services. In the opposite direction there will be a double terminus, at the CAAB and at the Michelino parking lot.Line 1 will feature 30 stops, for a total length of 16.5 km, of which 14.5 km with an overhead contact line; the 2-km tracks in the city center, from Porta San Felice to via Matteotti, won't feature any suspended power line, as the tram will be powered by batteries.The main attractors served by the line are Bologna Borgo Panigale railway station, the Maggiore Hospital, the city center, Bologna Centrale railway station, Bologna's Fiera District, the Pilastro district, the Faculty of Agriculture and the CAAB.\n\n\n== Historical network (1880\u20131963) ==\nThe first plans for six horsecar lines were approved by the town council in 1877:\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele-Bologna Centrale railway station\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele-Porta San Felice\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele-Barriera Santo Stefano\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele-Porta Maggiore\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele-Porta San Mamolo\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele-Porta Saragozza.Works on the first stretch, linking Bologna Centrale railway station to Piazza Maggiore, began in September 1880. Service began on Saturday, 2 October 1904.The first two electrified lines began operating on 11 February 1904.In 1953, it was decided that, starting from the following year, tramway lines would be gradually discontinued and transformed to bus and trolleybus lines.

          "If you get it in Winter time it is a waste of money as you cannot see almost anything through these overused plastic covers. But the worst thing is the mess on the time schedule. If you hop off at the San Luca Basilica be prepared to wait for more than 1:30 hour for the next",
          "unless you are an olympian,young,very fit or grazy dont take this train as its not for you as this for me is the only way up to the top and it was a very relaxing way to do it arriving with still lots of energy remaining to explore",
          "We got the last train of the day at 5:35pm. We left Piazza Maggiore around 5:50pm being the last trip and the staff awaiting as many customers as possible. The delayed departure did not bother us. It was a pleasant drive with porticos on our side most of the way up to Basilica",

          "Take my advice and avoid this train ride/commentary in favor of a bus ride to the site. First, it is possible to take a bus to the site, and, in fact, we walked back, which served to allow us to see less touristy shops and homes. The train was a disaster, with back jarring",

          "Such fun to have a ride on this little street train, the price is great only 10 euros per person 5 euros for disabled and 5 for carer. They give you ear phones for the guide . It's a lovely way to see the city and go up to San luca it's so high up and beautiful to experience,",
          "This is a great way to travel up to thge Basilica San Luca. That little vehicle has a lot of pwoer. Tickets are available on board, which include headphones for the commentary on the way up and down. The journey takes about 1/2 hour, and follows the line of the porticos.",
          "The small tourist train from Bologna's center up to the San Luca basilica is as hokey as you would expect a small train driving you around to be. It is well used by people of all nationalities, and does a good job of taking you to the top of the hill quickly. We rode this",
          "There are 2 cute tourist trains in the centre of Bologna. We wanted to go up to San Luca and walk down to see the 3.7 km of Porticos that are to be part of Unesco World Heritage (if not already). This was a great way to do that. We bought our tickets and because you have to",
          "If you have trouble walking or other medical problem this is the best way to start your Bologna visit. You can get a feeling of the most important amenities and architecture of this great city then you decide where to go. If you do not have medical problems or if you already",
          "This is a cute little 'train' the wends its way through the streets if Bologna and up the hill to San Luca. We visited on a Sunday so the timetable was a bit sparse and we decided to walk back down through the porticos and into the city. So glad we did as it was beautiful and",

          "This is a little road train that takes you up to the San Luca Basilica. Of course, you can walk up to the Basilica but this is an inexpensive, fun way to get to see the sights and get up to the top of a steep hill! The views from both the Basilica and the train itself were just",
          "Something to do if you want to visit San Luca and have the time to stay there until the next train passes. From there you have a stunning view on the city! If you are searching for luck and good will from above, don't take the train but go there by your own feet ;-)",

        "wiki": "Italy has a well developed transport infrastructure. \nThe Italian rail network is extensive, especially in the north, and it includes a high-speed rail network that joins the major cities of Italy from Naples through northern cities such as Milan and Turin. \nItaly has 2,507 people and 12.46 km2 per kilometer of rail track, giving Italy the world's 13th largest rail network.Italy's road network is also widespread, with a total length of about 487,700 km. \nIt comprises both an extensive motorway network (6,400 km), mostly toll roads, and national and local roads.\nBecause of its long seacoast, Italy also has many harbors for the transportation of both goods and passengers. \nTransport networks in Italy are integrated into the Trans-European Transport Networks.\n\n\n== Railways ==\n\nThe Italian railway system has a length of 19,394 km (12,051 mi), of which 18,071 km (11,229 mi) standard gauge and 11,322 km (7,035 mi) electrified. The active lines are 16,723 km. The network is recently growing with the construction of the new high-speed rail network.\nThe narrow gauge tracks are: \n\n112 km (70 mi) of 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) gauge (all electrified);\n1,211 km (752 mi) of 950 mm (3 ft 1 3\u20448 in) gauge (of which 153 km (95 mi) electrified)A major part of the Italian rail network is managed and operated by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, a state owned company. Other regional agencies, mostly owned by public entities such as regional governments, operate on the Italian network. The Italian railways are subsidised by the government, receiving \u20ac8.1 billion in 2009.Travellers who often make use of the railway during their stay in Italy might use Rail Passes, such as the European Inter-Rail or Italy's national and regional passes. These rail passes allow travellers the freedom to use regional trains during the validity period, but all high-speed and intercity trains require a 10-euro reservation fee. Regional passes, such as \"Io viaggio ovunque Lombardia\", offer one-day, multiple-day and monthly period of validity. There are also saver passes for adults, who travel as a group, with savings up to 20%. Foreign travellers should purchase these passes in advance, so that the passes could be delivered by post prior to the trip. When using the rail passes, the date of travel needs to be filled in before boarding the trains.\n\n\n=== High speed trains ===\n\nMajor works to increase the commercial speed of the trains already started in 1967: the Rome-Florence \"super-direct\" line was built for trains up to 230 km/h, and reduced the journey time to less than two hours. This is the first high-speed train line in Europe, as its operations started in 1977.\nIn 2009 a new high-speed line linking Milan and Turin, operating at 300 km/h, opened to passenger traffic, reducing the journey time from two hours to one hour. In the same year, the Milan-Bologna line was open, reducing the journey time to 55 minutes. Also the Bologna-Florence high-speed line was upgraded to 300 km/h for a journey time of 35 minutes.\nSince then, it is possible to travel from Turin to Salerno (ca. 950 km) in less than 5 hours. More than 100 trains per day are operated.The main public operator of high-speed trains (alta velocit\u00e0 AV, formerly Eurostar Italia) is Trenitalia, part of FSI. Trains are divided into three categories: Frecciarossa (\"Red arrow\") trains operate at a maximum of 300 km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento (Silver arrow) trains operate at a maximum of 250 km/h on both high-speed and mainline tracks; Frecciabianca (White arrow) trains operate at a maximum of 200 km/h on mainline tracks only.\nSince 2012, a new and Italy's first private train operator, NTV (branded as Italo), run high-speed services in competition with Trenitalia. Even nowadays, Italy is the only county in Europe with a private high-speed train operator.\nConstruction of the Milan-Venice high-speed line has begun in 2013 and in 2016 the Milan-Treviglio section has been opened to passenger traffic;  the Milan-Genoa high-speed line (Terzo Valico dei Giovi) is also under construction.\nToday it is possible to travel from Rome to Milan in less than 3 hours (2h 55') with the Frecciarossa 1000, the new high-speed train. To cover this route, there's a train every 30 minutes.\n\n\n=== Intercity trains ===\nWith the introduction of high-speed trains, intercity trains are limited to few services per day on mainline and regional tracks.\nThe daytime services (Intercity IC), while not freuquent and limited to one or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway's mainline network. The main routes are Trieste to Rome (stopping at Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan to Rome (stopping at Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / stopping at Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna to Lecce (stopping at Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (stopping at Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.\nThe night trains (Intercity Notte ICN) have sleeper compartments and washrooms, but no showers on board. Main routes are Rome to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Florence, Bologna, Verona, Rovereto and Trento), Milan to Lecce (calling at Bologna, Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi), Turin to Lecce (calling at Alessandria, Voghera, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, Rimini, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Reggio di Calabria to Turin (calling Naples, Rome, Livorno, La Spezia and Genova). Most portions of these ICN services run during the night; since most services take 10 to 15 hours to complete a one-way journey, their day-time portion provide extra train connections to complement with the Intercity services.\nThere are a total of 86 intercity trains running within Italy per day.\n\n\n=== Regional trains ===\nTrenitalia operates regional services (both fast veloce RGV and stopping REG) throughout Italy.\nRegional train agencies exist: their train schedules are largely connected to and shown on Trenitalia, and tickets for such train services can be purchased through Trenitalia's national network. Other regional agencies have separate ticket systems which are not mutually exchangeable with that of Trenitalia. These \"regional\" tickets could be purchased at local newsagents or tobacco stores instead.\n\nTrentino-Alto Adige / Trentino-S\u00fcdtirol: S\u00fcdtirol Bahn (South Tyrol Railway) runs regional services on Ala/Ahl-am-Etsch to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Rovereto/Rofreit, Trento/Trient and Mezzocorona/Kronmetz), Bolzano/Bozen to Merano/Meran, Bressanone/Brixen to San Candido/Innichen, and a direct \"Tirol regional express REX\" service between Bolzano/Bozen in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria.\nVeneto: Sistemi Territoriali runs regional trains in Veneto region.\nLombardy: Trenord runs the Malpensa Express airport train, many Milan's suburban lines and most regional train services in Lombardy. Trenord also co-operates with DB and \u00d6BB on the EuroCity Verona-Munich service, and with SBB CFF FFS (joint-venture TiLo) on the regional Milan-Bellinzona service.\nEmilia-Romagna: Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna provides vital connections across cities on different mainline networks, including Modena, Parma, Suzzara, Ferrara, Reggio Emilia and Bologna.\nTuscany: La Ferroviaria Italiana operates in Arezzo province.\nAbruzzo: Sangritana runs daily services between Pescara and Lanciano.In addition to these agencies, there's a great deal of other little operators, such as AMT Genova for the Genova-Casella railway.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nCities with metro systems:\n\nCities with commuter rail systems:\n\nBari (Bari metropolitan railway service)\nGenoa (Nodo Ferroviario di Genova, 5 lines)\nMilan (Milan suburban railway service)\nNaples, 5 lines\nPalermo (Palermo metropolitan railway service)\nRome, 8 lines (FR lines)\nSalerno (Salerno metropolitan railway service)\nTurin (Turin Metropolitan Railway Service)\n\n\n=== Rail links with adjacent countries ===\n\nItaly has 11 rail border crossings over the Alpine mountains with her neighbouring countries: six are designated as mainline tracks and two are metre-gauge tracks. The six mainline border crossings are: two with France (one for Nice and Marseille; the other for Lyon and Dijon), two with Switzerland (one for Brig, Bern and Geneva; the other for Chiasso, Lugano, Lucerne and Z\u00fcrich), and two with Austria (one for Innsbruck; the other for Villach, Graz and Vienna). The two metre-gauge track crossings are located at the border town of Tirano (enters Switzerland's Canton Graub\u00fcnden/Grisons) and Domodossola (enters Switzerland's Locarno).\nThere is a railway line connecting Italy's northeastern port of Trieste to Slovenia, but no passenger or freight services operate on this track. Consequently, there is no direct connections between Trieste and Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, despite the proximity of both cities.\n\nItaly-France: Marseille-Ventimiglia railway, currently EuroCity trains of Thello Milan-Marseille and one EuroNight train of RZD Moscow-Nice.\nItaly-France: Fr\u00e9jus Rail Tunnel at 1,338 m above sea, currently SNCF TGV trains Milan-Paris and Turin-Paris and EuroNight trains of Thello Venice-Paris\nItaly-Switzerland: Domodossola\u2013Locarno railway metre-gauge trains\nItaly-Switzerland: Simplon Tunnel, currently EuroCity trains of SBB CFF FFS Milan-Geneva and Milan-Bern\nItaly-Switzerland: connecting Varese (Italy) to Bellinzona (Switzerland) and runs on the eastern coast of Lake Maggiore\nItaly-Switzerland: Milan\u2013Chiasso railway, currently EuroCity trains of SBB CFF FFS Milan-Z\u00fcrich\nItaly-Switzerland: Bernina railway at 2,253 m above sea, metre-gauge trains of RhB Tirano-St. Moritz and the Bernina Express tourist train\nItaly-Austria: Brenner railway at 1,371 m above sea, currently EuroCity trains of \u00d6BB-DB Munich-Verona and Munich-Venice/Bologna, and DB CityNightLine Munich-Rome/Milan\nItaly-Austria: at 1,175 m above sea connecting San Candido/Innichen (Italy) and Lienz (Austria)\nItaly-Austria: connecting Venice and Udine (Italy) to Villach (Austria), currently EuroCity trains of \u00d6BB Venice-Vienna, EuroNight trains of \u00d6BB Vienna-Rome/Milan, and DB CityNightLine Munich-Venice\nItaly-Slovenia: Tarvisio\u2013Ljubljana RailwayThe Vatican City is also linked to Italy with a railway line serving a single railway station, the Vatican City railway station. This line is used only for special occasions.San Marino used to have a narrow gauge rail connection with Italy; this was dismantled in 1944.\n\n\n=== Stations ===\n\nItaly's top ten railway stations by annual passengers are:\n\nStations with darker background are also served by High-speed trains\n\n\n== Roads ==\n\nItaly is one of the countries with the most vehicles per capita, with 690 per 1000 people in 2010. Italy has a total of 487,700 km of paved roads, of which 6,758 km are motorways with a general speed limit of 130 km/h (81 mph), which since 2009 was provisioned for extension up to 150 km/h (93 mph). The speed limit in towns is usually 50 km/h (31 mph) and less commonly 30 km/h (19 mph).\n\n\n== Waterways ==\nItaly has 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of navigable waterways for various types of commercial traffic, although of limited overall value.In the northern regions of Lombardy and Venetia, commuter ferry boats operate on Lake Garda and Lake Como to connect towns and villages at both sides of the lakes. The waterways in Venice, including the Grand Canal, serve as the vital transportation network for local residents and tourists. Frequent shuttle ferries (vaporetta) connect different points on the main island of Venice and other outlying islands of the lagoon. In addition, there are direct shuttle boats between Venice and the Venice Marco Polo Airport.\n\n\n== Ports and harbours ==\n\n\n== Air transport ==\n\n\n=== Airlines ===\n\nItaly's largest airline is Alitalia, which was privatised in 2008. Its main hub is Rome Fiumicino Airport. Alitalia also operates a regional subsidiary under the Alitalia CityLiner brand.\nAn important regional airline is Air Dolomiti, owned by the German Lufthansa Group. Charter and leisure carriers include Neos, Blue Panorama Airlines and Poste Air Cargo. Major Italian cargo operators are Alitalia Cargo and Cargolux Italia.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nItaly is the fifth in Europe by number of passengers by air transport, with about 148 million passengers or about 10% of the European total in 2011. Most of passengers in Italy are on international flights (57%). A big share of domestic flights connect the major islands (Sardinia and Sicily) to the mainland. Domestic flights between major Italian cities as Rome and Milan still play a relevant role but are declining since the opening of the Italian high-speed rail network in recent years.\nItaly has a total as of 130 airports in 2012, of which 99 have paved runways:\nover 3,047 m: 9\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 31\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 18\n914 to 1,523 m: 29\nunder 914 m: 12Airports - with unpaved runways in 2012:\ntotal: 31\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 1\n914 to 1,523 m: 11\nunder 914 m: 19\n\n\n=== Busiest airports ===\n\nThis is a list of the top ten busiest airports in Italy in 2017.\n\n\n== Bus ==\nThere are long-distance intercity buses run by local companies, but the services are infrequent during the week and usually provide a secondary link to railway services.\nItaly does not have a nationwide coach operator. However, in 2015, the British company Megabus (Europe) launched daily intercity bus services on several domestic routes\nThis makes a daily total of 12 services in each direction between Rome and Bologna.\nFlixbus, a company founded in the course of the opening of the German intercity bus market also serves routes in Italy both domestic and international.\n\n\n=== Airport shuttle ===\nAirport shuttle buses, however, are highly developed and convenient for rail travellers. Most airports in Italy are not connected to the railway network, except for Rome Fiumicino Airport, Milan Malpensa Airport and Turin Caselle Airport. In Bologna, a light-rail track is under construction to connect Bologna Airport to the main railway station.\n\nVenice: Venezia-Mestre station - Marco Polo Airport (50 minutes) and Treviso Airport\nMilan: Milano Centrale station - Malpensa Airport (1 hour 5 minutes), Linate Airport (35 minutes) and Milan Bergamo Airport (1 hour)\nBrescia: Brescia station - Milan Bergamo Airport (1 hour)\nRome: Rome Termini station - Fiumicino Airport by train\nVerona: Verona Porta Nuova station - Villafranca \"Catullo\" Airport (20 minutes)\nBologna: Centrale station - Bologna Airport (20 minutes)\nPescara Centrale station - Abruzzo Airport (10 minutes)\nFlorence: Firenze S M Novella station - Florence Airport\n\n\n=== Local bus ===\nLocal buses are usually divided into urban (urbano) and suburban (interurbano or extraurbano) lines.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEconomy of Italy\nHistory of Italy\nRenewable energy in Italy\nTourism in Italy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Transport in Italy at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Marina Apollonio (born 12 November 1940) is an Italian painter and Optical artist. She lives and works in Padua.\n\n\n== Work ==\nApollonio was born in Trieste on 12 November 1940. She and her family moved to Venice when she was eight. In Venice she attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia.\nIn 1963 Apollonio produced her first work, Metal Reliefs with Alternate Color Sequences. She shared with other Op-Artists the interest in a depersonalized art, as opposite to Abstract Expressionism. She used industrial material in her process, creating dynamic and fluctuating environments in the user's perception.In 1965 she became part of the international Op Art movement, meeting and exhibiting with artists such as Gruppo N Padua; Gruppo T Milan; Getulio Alviani; Dadamaino and Azimuth Milan. In the same year she was invited to Nova Tendencija 3, an international group show held at the Galerija Suvremene Umjetnosti in Zagreb, to Aktuel \u201965 at the Galerie Aktuel Bern and, together with Getulio Alviani and Paolo Scheggi, the Oeuvres Plastiques et Appliqu\u00e8es at Galerie Smith in Bruxelles.In 1975 Apollonio started making work based on the hortogonal relationship of parallel colored lines. In 1981 she expamded her practice to textiles, showing her works at the Laboratorio Artivisive Foggia and later, in 1983, at the exhibitions Morbide & Trame, at the Civica Galleria d\u2019Arte Contemporanea in Foggia and Testi Tessili, at the Il Monte Analogo Library in Rome.\nIn 2007 she presented her work Spazio ad attivazione cinetica 1967-1971/2007, a 10-meter rotating disc, in the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt for the international show Op Art, where she was invited to exhibit together with Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Fran\u00e7ois Morellet, Julio Le Parc and Gianni Colombo. \nHer work has also been included in other Op Art shows such as Optic Nerve: Perceptual Art of the 1960s, at the Columbus Museum of Art and Bit International  Nove tendencije - Computer und visuelle Forschung. Zagreb 1961-1973, at the Neue Galerie in Graz.Her works have been reviewed by major news publications.\n\n\n== Selected solo exhibitions ==\n1966 Centro Arte Viva Feltrinelli, Trieste; Centro d\u2019Arte il Chiodo, Palermo; Galleria 1+1, Padua\n1967 Galleria il Cenobio, Milan; Studio 2b, Bergamo\n1968 Galleria Sincron, Brescia; Galleria Barozzi, Venice\n1969 Studio di Informazione Estetica, Turin\n1970 Galerie Historial, Nyon; Galerie 58, Rapperswil, Switzerland\n1971 Galleria la Chiocciola, Padua\n1972 Galleria dei Mille, Bergamo; Imeges 70, Abano, Italy; Il Segnapassi, Pesaro\n1973 Neue Galerie Am Landes Museum Joanneum, Graz\n1974 Galleria il Nome, Vigevano, Italy\n1975 Galleria Temi, Bari; Galleria Method, Bergamo\n1979 Arte Struktura, Milan\n1981 Centro ricerche artistiche Verifica 8+1, Venice\n2008 Neue Galerie, Graz\n\n\n== Selected group exhibitions ==\n1964 Il Chiodo d\u2019oro, Centro d\u2019Arte il Chiodo, Palermo\n1965 Aktuel 65, Galerie Aktuel, Berne; Nova Tendencija 3, Galerija Suvremene Umjetnosti, Zagreb; Oeuvres Plastiques et Appliqu\u00e9es, Galerie Smith, Bruxelles\n1966 Op-pop, Galerie D, Frankfurt; 11\u00b0 Premio Castello Svevo, Termoli; Premio S.

        "wiki": "The basilica of Santo Stefano (Italian: Basilica di Santo Stefano) encompasses a complex of religious edifices in the city of Bologna, Italy.  Located on Piazza Santo Stefano, it is locally known as Sette Chiese (\"Seven Churches\") and Santa Gerusalemme (\"Holy Jerusalem\"). It has the dignity of minor basilica.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to tradition Saint Petronius, a bishop of the city during the 5th century, built the basilica over a temple of the goddess Isis. The saint wished to have a building that recalled the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nThe different parts of the complex include:\n\nChurch of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crucifix (8th century, presbytery reshaped in 17th century), with the Crypt\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre (according to tradition: 5th century)\nChurch of the Saints Vitale and Agricola (4th century, rebuilt first in the 12th century)\nCourtyard of Pilate (\"Santo Giardino\", 13th century)\nChurch of the Trinity or of the Martyrium (13th century)\nChapel of the Bandage (\"Cappella della Benda\") dedicated to the strip of cloth worn around the head  by the Virgin Mary  as a sign of mourning.\nPilate's Courtyard recalls the lithostrotos, where Jesus was condemned; it leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In the center, a basin called the \"Catino di Pilato\", a Lombard work from 737-744, bears the following inscription:\nUMILIB(US) VOTA SUSCIPE D(OMI)NE D(OM)N(ORUM) N(OST)R(ORUM) LIUTPRAN(TE) ILPRAN(TE) REGIB(US) ET D(OMI)N(O) BARBATU EPISC(OPO) S(AN)C(TE) HECCL(ESIE) B(O)N(ONIEN)S(I)S. HIC I(N) H(ONOREM) R(ELIGIOSI) SUA PRAECEPTA OBTULERUNT, UNDE HUNC VAS IMPLEATUR IN CENAM D(OMI)NI SALVAT(ORI)S, ET SI QUA MUN(ER)A C(UISQUAM) MINUERIT, D(EU)S REQ(UIRET)\nUnder the portico at the center of a window on a column, a 14th-century sculpted rooster, called the Rooster of St Peter, recalls the biblical story of Saint Peter's denial.\n\n\n== Church of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crucifix ==\nThe church of the Crucifix is of Lombard origin and dates back to the 8th century: it consists of a single nave with a trussed vault and a raised presbytery on the crypt. In the nave, on the left, there is the XVIII century statuary complex of the Compianto sul Cristo morto by Angelo Gabriello Pi\u00f2 [3]. At the center of the presbytery, remodeled in the seventeenth century, which is accessed via a staircase, is the Crucifix, the work of Simone dei Crocifissi dating back to about 1380. On the walls there are 15th century frescoes with the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen.\nUnder the presbytery there is the crypt divided into five naves with columns of different invoice, one of which, according to legend, from the base to the capital is perfectly equivalent to Jesus (about one meter and seventy, very high for the time); at the end of it, in two urns placed on an altar, the remains of the Saints Vitale and Agricola are kept. On the sides of the altar, a few years ago, two 16th century frescoes were found under a layer of plaster, illustrating the martyrdom of Vitale and Agricola. In the left aisle, at the back near the altar, there is a small fresco of the early fifteenth century, the so-called Madonna della Neve, perhaps of Lippo di Dalmasio. An object of lesser artistic value but of some suggestion is the white statue of the Madonna Bambina, at the beginning of the crypt, on the right wall.\n\n\n== Church of the Holy Sepulchre ==\n\nThe church dates back to the fifth century, built by the bishop Petronius as a simulacrum of the Constantinian Sepulcher of Jerusalem and rebuilt at the beginning of the eleventh century by Benedictine monks after it was heavily damaged during the devastating 10th century Hungarian invasions. The building, with a central plan, is built on a perimeter with an irregular octagonal base in the center of which a dodecagonal dome is erected. Inside there are 12 columns of marble and brick, while in the center there is a shrine that housed the relics of San Petronio, found here in 1141. The door of the Sepulcher is opened one week a year, after the celebration of mass midnight Easter, in the presence of the Knights of the Holy Sepulcher.\nIn ancient times it was possible to crawl inside to venerate the remains of the saint; the prostitutes of Bologna, on Easter morning, moreover, in memory of Mary Magdalene, went there to pronounce, before the Holy Sepulcher, a prayer whose content they themselves never wanted to reveal. Still according to another ancient tradition, pregnant women in Bologna used to walk thirty-three times (one for each year of the Savior's life) around the Sepulcher, entering each lap in the tomb to pray; at the end of the thirty-third lap, the women then went to the nearby church of the Martyrium to pray before the fresco of the pregnant Madonna. Today the body of St. Petronius is no longer in this church, after which in the year 2000 Cardinal Giacomo Biffi had it moved to the Basilica of San Petronio, which already guarded the head of the patron saint of the city.\n\nIn the church there is also a water source which, in the symbolism of the Stefan complex based on the passion of Christ, is identified with the waters of the Jordan, and which from the archaeological point of view refers to the sacred source of the pre-existing isiac complex. Probably the temple of Isis was in this area, as it seems demonstrated, as well as by the presence of the source (the cult of the Egyptian goddess required the presence of a source of spring water), the persistence of seven Greek marble columns, coming from the city of Karistos (according to surveys made by the University of Geology of Padua), certainly from the Roman period; they have been reused, as you can clearly see, since the seven Roman columns, still standing, were flanked in the Middle Ages by as many brick columns, while where Roman columns were missing, destroyed by the Hungarians raids, new columns were built more robust.\nA column of black cipollino marble, of African origin and of the Roman era (also certainly reused from a previous building), offset from the others, symbolizes the column where Christ was scourged and, as stated in a scroll, guaranteed 200 years of indulgence to each and every time you visit this place.\nThe vault and the walls of the church originally had frescoes with biblical scenes created by Marco Berlinghieri (son of Berlinghiero Berlinghieri) in the mid-thirteenth century, almost entirely eliminated in 1804 to be replaced by new frescoes in Baroque style made by Filippo Pedrini, in turn eliminated by subsequent restorations of the late nineteenth century; what remains of the original thirteenth-century frescoes (a scene representing the Strage of the Innocents) is visible in the basilica museum.\n\n\n== Church of the Saints Vitale and Agricola ==\n\nIt is the oldest of the complex. This basilica-shaped church, without a transept, with a salient fa\u00e7ade and triconca apse, is dedicated to the patron saints Vitale and Agricola and since its construction it housed the relics of the two saints, respectively servant and master, the first two martyrs from Bologna times of Diocletian (305 AD). In 393 the remains are moved from Ambrogio to be taken to Milan (a fact that testifies that the basilica was already built) and also in the fifth century a messenger was sent by Namazio, bishop of Clermont, to have relics of the Bolognese protomartyrs.\nAt the beginning of the XV century a paleochristian sepulcher with the inscription \"Symon\" had been found and the rumor had spread that it was the tomb of Simon Peter, that is of Saint Peter. This news, devoid of any historical foundation, had attracted many pilgrims, distracting them from Rome, the classic destination of pilgrimage. The pope, Pope Eugene IV, then reacted vehemently: he made the church open, he had it filled with earth and left it in this state for about seventy years. Subsequently, through the intercession of the archbishop Giuliano Della Rovere, the church was restored and reopened for worship. An inscription on the side door recalls the event: \"JUL. CARD. S. P. AD VINC. RESTITUIT\". Inside the church there are some interesting finds: remains of Roman mosaic floor, visible through a glass. Then, in the two side apses, two early medieval sarcophagi attributed to Vitale and Agricola, with figures of animals (lions, deer and peacocks) in a raised relief. In the right aisle, on the wall, a cross is identified as that of the torture of St. Agila (in reality it dates back to a later period). The main altar, made up of a turned pagan altar, is set against the back wall (according to the pre-conciliar liturgy, when the celebrant gave his back to the faithful during the celebrations).\n\n\n== Courtyard of Pilate ==\n\nAt the Cortile di Pilato, so called to commemorate the lithostrotos, the place where Jesus was condemned, is accessed by exiting the church of the Sepulcher. The courtyard is bordered to the north and south by two porticoes in Romanesque style with characteristic cruciform columns in brick and brings to the center a limestone basin resting on a pedestal (more recent, 16th century) the so-called \"Pilato's Cat\" : this basin is a Longobard work dating back to 737-744 and bears an inscription under the edge of which is reported the most accredited transcription:\n\u00ab + UMILIB(US) VOTA SUSCIPE D(OMI)NE D(OM)N(ORUM) N(OST)R(ORUM) LIUTPRAN(TE) ILPRAN(TE) REGIB(US) ET D(OM)N(O) BARBATU EPISC(OPO) S(AN)C(TE) HECCL(ESIE) B(O)N(ONIEN)S(I)S. HIC I(N) H(ONOREM) R(ELIGIOSI) SUA PRAECEPTA OBTULERUNT, UNDE HUNC VAS IMPLEATUR IN CENAM D(OMI)NI SALVAT(ORI)S, ET SI QUA MUN(ER)A C(UISQUAM) MINUERIT, D(EU)S REQ(UIRET) \u00bb\nUnder the portico, in the center of a window, on a column, there is a stone rooster dating back to the fourteenth century, called \"Gallo di S. Pietro\" to remember the evangelical episode of the denial of Jesus. Always under the portico is It is possible to observe some mortuary tombstones including one, with a pair of real scissors in the center, belonging to a tailor. Significant for the symbolism of the passion of Christ is that the distance between this courtyard and the nearby church of San Giovanni in Monte (so called because it stands on the only natural protuberance of the central dish of Bologna) would be the same that there is in Jerusalem between the Holy Sepulcher and Calvary.\n\n\n== Church of the Trinity or of the Martyrium ==\nAlso called the Church of the Holy Cross or of Calvary or Trinity. Originally it had to be built in the form of a basilica with 5 naves, with an apse in front of the holy garden (Pilato's courtyard) and the fa\u00e7ade to the east, exactly as it was originally the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem wanted by Constantino. Probably due to lack of funds, Petronius could not complete the building that remained unfinished. Later, with the advent of the Lombards, it would become a Baptistery. At the beginning of a thousand, during the reconstructions made by the Benedictines, there were several uncertainties about how to finish the work, considering that the original Holy Sepulcher had been heavily altered and in those years the Fatimite Caliph al-Hakim was working its destruction . So having lost the historical references of what it was originally, the Benedictines could not complete it. After the late nineteenth-century renovations, currently it is divided into 5 naves, with the fa\u00e7ade facing the courtyard and the apse facing east, both built in neo-Romanesque style on the model of the Holy Sepulcher built by the Crusaders. From the time of the Crusades and until 1950, a relic of the Holy Cross was kept in the central chapel.\nOf great interest, in the last little chapel, entering on the right, there is permanently placed the large wooden group of the Adoration of the Magi, with man-sized statues. It is the oldest known crib in the world made up of statues in the round. [5] A detailed study of the work published in 1981 by Massimo Ferretti, at the end of the first major restoration carried out by Marisa and Otello Caprara, has identified that the sculptor of the statues is the same Master of the Crucifix 1291 kept in the Art Collections of the City of Bologna . The work was first sculpted by trunks of lime and elm, perhaps in the last decade of the thirteenth century by an anonymous Bolognese sculptor. The work remained colorless until 1370, when it was commissioned by the Bolognese painter Simone dei Crocifissi who took care of the rich polychrome and gilding with his very personal Gothic style. The 1981 restoration brought out the splendid polychrome, which had darkened over the centuries, as you can see in the photos before that restoration. But with the subsequent passing of years the humidity of the Church, in which the work was exhibited throughout the year, had begun to ruin the polychrome again. For this reason, at the beginning of 2000 the statues were taken a couple at a time and were restored again, until 2004, when all the work was exhibited in the Pinacoteca di Bologna, where it remained until Christmas 2006, when it was reported to Santo Stefano. Finally, on 21 January 2007 the complete work was inaugurated inside a large electronically controlled humidity and temperature case, equipped with shatterproof glass, which houses the entire group in a permanent and permanent form.\nIn this church there are also pieces of frescoes from the 14th century, in particular a fragment showing Sant'Orsola with her companions of martyrdom and a pregnant Madonna who, besides being of exquisite workmanship, touches the loving gesture with which she caresses her bursting belly; the other hand of the Virgin holds a book.\nThe last little chapel on the right has been dedicated, in recent times, to the Bersaglieri, but is devoid of artistic content.\n\n\n== Scholarly interest ==\nThe focus of scholarly discussion has been for many years the supposed similarity between the so-called \"New Jerusalem\" rebuilt here, according to a vita written in 1180, by Saint Petronius in the 5th century, and the largely lost 4th-century complex erected by Constantine the Great at the purported site of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Unfortunately the archaeological evidence from Bologna dates primarily to the 11th and 12th centuries, leaving the question about an earlier date still unanswered (at least until 1981). On the other hand, archaeology has meanwhile delivered many answers regarding the Constantinian church complex from Jerusalem, therefore the main interest presented by the 12th-century parts of the Church of Santo Stefano might much rather be their similarity to the almost contemporary Crusader Church of the Holy Sepulchre from Jerusalem, of which not all parts are preserved.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "You might be forgiven for underrating this Abbey as nothing more than another church from the outside. That would be a mistake, as there is beautiful set of buildings inside, each connected to the the other and well worth the effort of glinting in. Donations are sought. Those of",

          "This complex of several churches on the same site is a worth taking the time to explore. The spaces are intimate and interlinked so you never get an over view. It\u2019s more involving than walking up one aisle and down the opposite one, looking at the monuments on the way. Don\u2019t",

          "The church complex is certainly unusual in its layout and I\u2019ve seen nothing like it before. Each of the remaining churches has a distinct style and together they make a very interesting place to roam. The museum is well worth stopping by as you get right up close to some ancient",
          "This fascinating jumble of seven tiny churches is a fascinating journey through the history of Italian church architecture. Utterly delightful!",
          "Known locally as the Seven Churches, this is a fascinating site to visit. Interesting to see the original old chapel contrasting with different cloisters and other areas of the space. Free admission, just asks for small donation to support restoration.",

          "One of the highlights of my visit to Bologna! There are several churches to visit here, from different centuries. It's fascinating to explore them one by one. Don't miss this place!",
          "A church made of 7 churches through the centuries. Your self guided challenge is to figure out what church you're in at any time, and to id all 7. Good luck...fyi there are maps there and read about it ahead of time...it will help.",

          "The Basilica is one of the sights to see on the edge of the square. And for this reason it\u2019s worth a peek! It is huge scale with a mostly I decorated interior. The sundial built into the floor is worth checking out when the sun hits it!",
          "Only four of the original churches remain and it is a fascinating site.So much to see and appreciate especially the wooden sculpture of the Magi's adoration of the newborn Christ.",
          "A must see in Bologna. The churches are each beautiful in their unique way. Also when we visited, there were several large school groups. If this is the case, you may be ushered in before the groups.",
          "Lovely complex of old churches, dating from the middle ages to the 18th century. Nice to wander round, and, unlike many Italian churches, no charge to enter. They ask for donations, and when I went to put more than a couple of euro in the box, they told me it was plenty. Well",

          "Compared to cathedrals in Rome, Florence and Siena the exterior of this one isn\u2019t the most amazing but the interior does make up for it so make sure you go inside. Height of the roof makes for a very special space and some of the alcoves are very ornate.",
          "This complex of churches, including a large courtyard helping to connect the 4 churches remaining of the original 7, is well worth wandering through to enjoy the many architectural details and historical artifacts. No fee for entry but you will likely be moved to make a nice",
          "Some parts date back to the 5th century. It is composed of seven churches symbolic of the way of the cross. With very few english signs or information, going there without a guide or guide book is a little futile. Not a place for children unless they are very contained. It is",

          "This is well worth a look. The 'Seven Churches' complex can be found on Piazza Santo Stefano, about five minute's walk to the East of the main town square of Piazza Maggiore. This is a complex of different churches from different eras, all interconnected internally, with a nice",
          "An amazing place to visit. Such a lot of history contained within the walls of this complex of 4 churches. No entrance fee but a small donation of 50 cents per person requested which was excellent value. A well equipped shop and small museum.",
          "We were glad that we had the opportunity to visit the Basilica of Santo Stefano; a complex of religious buildings. It is locally known as Sette Chiese (\"Seven Churches\") and Santa Gerusalemme (\"Holy Jerusalem\"). However, today there are only four churches. One of the churches",

          "Very interesting place. Free to visit. Fascinating historical site. Great to wander around. Years of history",
          "This is a church complex which started in roman times and grew through the centuries. Ignore the menacing mink in the first church- a despicable technique to intimidate tourists to give some money. You don\u2019t have to and the shop has things you may want if you nay want to give an",

          "La Basilica di Santo Stefano is for sure one of my favorite places to go every time I'm in Bologna! It's magic... you walk in and you see this simple church, without any rich artwork pieces! But you keep walking in and you find yourself inside a peaceful area, that makes you",

          "We were lucky to get there before the crowds so had a few photo opportunities without people wondering through. The history of this Basilica is worth reading about so you get to know the background and history surrounding it.",

          "Quite unexpected beauty here. If you catch it at a quiet time it\u2019s like a sanctuary in the city. The brick work and undecorated interior are superb and very atmospheric. The small courtyard near the shop is also a very tranquil place to rest for a moment. Helped by the",

          "This group of 'joined' churches is a must-see while in Bologna. While not lavishly decorated by some standards, they are beautiful places to be in (irrespective of religious belief). In some respects I preferred them to the lavish, over the top churches in the main cities of",

          "Interesting to see how buildings developed over the years. Here the old ones survived so now you have a cluster of churches and cloisters which somehow complement each other. Probably the best church experience of our stay.",
          "Not impressive as you enter. A not so great altar on a top of a concrete staircase... but suddenly a friar leads you to the entrance of the cript, and there, a wonderful world opens. A well presented history of the evolution of the church along the ages, many historic paintings",

          "This was a verging interesting basilica to visit. It is actually a few churches (I believe 7) in which the oldest is 1000 years olds. We had a private guide the day before we entered this basilica so he only talked about the outside with us. We entered today and leisure walked",
          "Many people here have said the same: If you have just a little time to see Bologna or if you stay longer... this is the place to see! You will be surprised of the complex! We visited the seven churches on a rainy day, so it was very silent, relaxing and solemn experience.",

The two-storey museum opened in 2001, and was renovated in June 2016 to provide exhibit space for more models. The goal of the museum is to cover all major milestones in the Lamborghini's history. For this purpose, the museum displays a family tree that shows all the models ever produced by the company. The current gallery contains iconic supercars such as the 350 GT and the Sesto Elemento, and one-off and concept cars such as the Veneno and the Miura concept.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of automobile museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseo Lamborghini \u2013 part of the Lamborghini official site (in English)\nMuseo Lamborghini at Automuseums\nGoogle Virtual Gallery Tour\nMuseo Lamborghini at WR7",

          "Definitely a cool place to visit for any car enthusiast. The factory tour was neat and it\u2019s interesting to see how the assembly line works. Definitely recommend if you\u2019re a car person!",
          "We are a family of 5 looking forward to Lamborghini factory tour and museum visit for 1.30pm on 9 Dec 2019 Tuesday. As it is our first visit and being self organised, we were not aware that parking was not available on premise. So my husband dropped us off at the museum first,",
          "There is no parking on site for visitors to the museum (the security guard will turn you away) so you have to drive around the side roads to find somewhere to park. If you have a factory tour booked then leave plenty of time to park and walk back. It is a lot smaller than the",
          "This was a specific detour (on our summer trip) for my 15 year old son who is a Lambo fanatic; I told him it took a plane, a train and a bus (plus a short walk) to get to the museum, as we did the DIY version (very easy to do, and saved us hundreds of euros for our family of 4).",
          "You can see many different Lambo's up close and personal. No touching, so this is not a touchy feely science museum place. The history of the brand is shown and all in it was quite enjoyable. We did not do the factory tour, however some folks returned from the factory tour",
          "My 15 year old son loves cars. It was his dream to come visit. This is very expensive but the staff is very welcoming and friendly. They all speak perfect English and they were very generous to accommodate us because we didn\u2019t realize how long it took from Florence and so we",
          "You can see every vehicle ever produced by Lamborghini except Murci\u00e9lago. There is only Murci\u00e9lago's derivate Revent\u00f3n. Highly recommended if you like any Italian sports cars.",
          "We decided to stop by Lamborghini Museum, 30 km away from Bologna, for a 1.5 hrs visit. The 2 storey museum is part of Lamborghini complex. The cars look like from fiction movie, with the names of Centenario, Huracan Evo Spyder,.. The children really enjoyed the Museum.",
          "We, especially my son of 19 had a gala time visiting both Lamborghini and Ferrari museum Cars displayed with detailed description was \u2014 once in lifetime experience Cannot miss this chance But NOT SPREADED OVER A BOG AREA PR WELL ORGANISED AS IN FERRARI OVER ALL \ud83d\udc4d",
          "We enjoyed this museum more than the neighboring Ferrari one--cooler and rarer cars to see. The museum is quite small so a visit doesn't take much time. It is a bit pricy but comparable to similar museums.",
          "Past and present, the museum caters for the enthusiast of the premium motor makers known as Lamborghini. The museum is small but insightful, and the factory tour is just as rewarding. It's great to see the cars being assembled piece by piece from chassis to finished miracle.",

          "We were in holidays in Italy and went to visit the Lamborghini museum and factory in Bologna, the factory is amazing, albeit expensive to do the tour, it is amazing to see how each car is hand crafted and how clean and organised the factory is run. The museum attached to it is",
          "We stopped at the museum on our way from Bologna to Turin. It is a nice place to visit and there is a pretty good tour as well which describes the history of Lamborghini and the different car models. There is also a fun driving simulator with the optional virtual reality",
          "My wife and I have done numerous car museums and factory tours, and while this one has its pluses and minuses, overall it was excellent. In the negative column it is probably, almost certainly, too expensive. The factory tour itself is definitely too expensive, and the museum",
          "Kind of nice but too expensive for the price. Done in less than 1 hour. \u20ac40 for four people. Don\u2019t waste your money or time. My husband is a car nut and thought it was boring.",

          "Visited this museum to enjoy the beautiful supercars that Lamborghini make and to appreciate the history of this carmaker. The musuem is very well laid out, very informative and gives you the opportunity to closely drool over old and new Lambos. The factory tour would have been",
          "We booked the factory tour about a month in advance. It was costly - but thought we would splurge. Our tour was in English - but our guide spoke very fast with her Italian accent - and with the poor sound quality of the headphones it was difficult to make out all she was",
          "If you want the factory tour, you should probably reserve at least two weeks in advance because that is in demand. Otherwise, the museum itself is very nice with a timeline of Lamborghini through the ages and every Lamborghini model there is, with cars such as the Centenario and",
          "You have to reserve the factory tour in advance (75\u20ac) - it is worth it! I did not have any specialized knowledge whatsoever about Lamborghinis beforehand, but was extremely impressed by the tour. Both the tour itself (comprehensive and interesting, very well organized, very",

          "Really really enjoyable experience. Expensive but so worth it. \u20ac50 for a child ticket 6-14yrs and \u20ac75 for an adult. But hey it\u2019s lambo, and they sure ain\u2019t cheap ! Museum part was very good, about 30ish cars on display, from the very first to the new of course. Some costing",

          "I am a big fan of sports car and thought I would visit this one. It was quite disappointing. 6 old timers and about 10 new models, but very little information, insights, or learning for me. Nice cars but that\u2019s it. One of the least interesting car museum I have seen. In the area",
          "Visited museum yesterday . My boys (teen and pre- teen) truly enjoyed it . Museum is not very big. Maybe 20-25 cars all together . First floor with older classic cars and the second floor for the modern cars. Really nice layout. Took about an hour . Right across the street is",

Honestly, my wife dragged me along, she\u2019s a car fanatic, but I had a Lamborghini poster on my wall when I was a teen, so she didn\u2019t really drag me\ud83d\ude0f",
          "You expect a manufacturer like Lamborghini would have a great museum with many classic cars! Not! About six classics, and the rest about another 15 all modern. More of a sales room. Logistically, badly marked. Museum on one side and car parking on the other. At 15 EURO per adult",
          "if you are a car fan, don't miss, better then the Ferrari tour. with Audi backing Lamborghini has become a bullet proof supercar. super modern factory with extreme attention to detail",
          "The museum is kind of small, with only 2 floors and 20ish cars total, but the factory tour made the whole thing worth it! We also traveled afterwards to Maranello to the Ferrari Museum, being told it is the better of the 2 close Ferrari museums. I would have picked the",
          "The museum is pretty cool because they have every car that kids have had posters of for decades, but the factory tour is the real draw of visiting Lamborghini. The price for the factory tour is pretty steep but worth every penny. They take you through the entire process and you",
          "We were on an Italian road trip and visiting Lamborghini meant a 2 hour drive out of our way in bad weather - but we decided it was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. We had read some of the poor reviews about staff and lack of vehicles but it was something we knew we",
          "Its not a museum its a concept museum so its vert small only two floors. But if you are a petrol head like me you will enjoy it. To see the Diablo fully restored to be close to the marchialago. Those magical thing are a work of art. Adult ticket sold for 15\u20ac.",
          "The cars on display were incredible and the history provided alongside the cars was very informative. But the place was otherwise very lacking, partly because it is of need of greater floor space. It will be hard to fit in any new models in coming years. No coffee shop - when I",
          "As someone who is in a similar field I am stunned by the lack of customer service. We were accosted as we entered the drop off area in front of the Museum by some strange parking attendant. The lack of interest and hostility continued with the staff throughout our visit. Must",
          "The factory is fascinating. What a shame there is no passion or enthusiasm from the guide or the miserable looking girl in the museum.",
          "i was invited on a 1-1 personal tour during November 2018 the lady guides knowledge was impressive ! Not one question could she not answer i had a great tour of the 3 main production lines and the museum a good day out and well worth flying from the UK for just this tour",
          "We pre-booked the Lamborghini factory tour online ourselves after finding the ex-Bologna package tours very expensive. Finding the local bus and factory were easy following instructions on the booking confirmation. We arrived in Bologna on a weekend and pre-purchased our bus",
          "We toured the factory and museum. Everything is hand made right down to the color someone selects. We were told someone picked out their car color based on the woman\u2019s nail polish color. Worth the time and experience",
          "We wanted a car day in our recent Tuscany Villa holiday. 8 of us packed up and made the journey north to Lamborghini and its not to be named famous cousin. The Lamborghini Museum features a most excellent history of the Lambo line, including the revered Hurrican. The museume is",

          "We found the entry expensive just to walk around some cars... but then they were these cars!!!! As a child of the 80s to be this up close and personal with an original emerald green Countach was just breathtaking. After visiting Ferrari and Maserati which are all about curves,",
          "I went to the museum and factory tour with 11 yr old son. Museum has old and new models on display. Its not big but then the main attraction is the tour. Its worth the money and you need to book in advance to get your slot. My son loved the tour seeing the new cars step by step",
          "We missed out on a factory tour which we have heard is good and so just did the museum tour. We loved listening to the history of the cars and their progression as well as the vision of Ferruccio. You obviously aren't allowed to touch or sit in the cars (I wouldn't want people",
          "Having been on a number of factory tours, this is the shortest (50 minutes) and most expensive (\u20ac75). It should be longer and include the Urus production line. It is however a unique opportunity to see the cars being assembled and our guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic.",
          "We did the museum and factory tour. As others have mentioned, the factory tour lasts about 50 minutes (ours went a little long due to questions from the group) and is a must if coming to the museum. It was incredible to see the cars being built and to learn about how they",
          "The factory tour was one of the highlights of our Italy trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone, car enthusiast or not. Watching the V10 Huracan and V12 Aventador being put together by master craftsmen and engineers was like watching a modern work of art in creation.",
          "We started our day with this museum trip before visiting the Ferrari museum and we were happy we did that because the Ferrari Museum was way better. That said we came out of this place liking it. Small collection of beautiful cars. If you\u2019re a student, make sure you bring your",
          "Car enthusiast or not, the production tour is worth every cent. I've always loved Lamborghini's and wanted to understand more about exactly what goes into making such a beautiful machine. It's such an impressive factory, and the tour guide did a great job showing and explaining",
          "We did the factory tour and all of us loved it even those of the family that aren\u2019t a car enthusiast. It is lovely to see the cars are still virtually hand made .... well they should be got the price they are sold at, but it is good to see craftsmanship still lives. The museum",
          "I enjoyed this museum much more than the Ferrari museum because it is less about merchandise and more about the history of a man whose background was farming and then the military. That influence is so evident in the progression of vehicles which he devised - from tractors to",
          "This is the biggest tourist trap I have personally experienced in my life. 75\u20ac (!) for a museum with 10 cars and 30 minute tour of the factory. You are not even allowed to touch or sit inside the cars.",
          "We went to the address of the museum, only to be turned away by a Lamborghini representative, since there was no parking. After asking where the parking was, we got the answer \u201dis outside, please move\u201d A really bad way to treat fans of the brand.",
          "We visited the museum with a group of colleagues. It was nice to walk around. We did not have a tour. So we just took pictures",
          "It seems a little pricey at Euro 75 but for me it was well worth it. You get up close and see how these fabulous cars are still handmade with loving care by a skilled and passionate workforce. Our guide (I wish I could remember her name!) was excellent, had great knowledge of",
          "Modern, tidy museum. Not huge but it is big enough to house at least one of each Lamborghini built. No parking on site, a fact not made clear on their website and the road signs direct you onto the factory site, where you are told to turn around and leave.",
          "We just completed the 1 hour tour of the factory. Our tour guide Georgia was excellent. It\u2019s well worth the 75 euro to see the assembly lines for two lines. Each one is assembled manually. Very impressive! The cost includes access to the museum.",
          "Having visited the 2 Ferrari museums just before this one, I have to say I was most impressed with it. First off, don\u2019t follow your GPS and drive straight to the front door. That is the employee parking. There is free onstreet parking on the side street next to the Bull Bar",
          "29th of August 12pm midday. I did not realise there was ZERO parking. Its a tiny village in the middle of nowhere. You would expect plenty of parking in the road. The signage is confusing. I pulled in at the gate to ask about parking thinking I had missed the sign for it. The",
          "We were driving from Venice to Monatione and I persuaded the family to make a detour off the motorway to visit the museum. I don't have a Lamborghini and in all honesty, I'll probably never have one so it was nice to see these beautiful cars close up. They had a great section",
          "We paid the money to do a private Lamborghini test drive on the tracks first then headed to the museum. We missed the factory tour because we went during August - when the factory is shut down for most of the month.",
          "Fantastic tour and museum. Great cars. Don't miss it. Nice gift shop. Will go back again someday. You can catch a cab from the train station in Bologna.",
          "There were many beautiful, famous Lamborghinis to look at. I have never been a huge car enthusiast, but I left this museum feeling a greater appreciation for Lamborghini's. Wow! They sure were beautiful cars!",
          "Spent an hour or so here and was a little underwhelmed. I expected it to be bigger I suppose and maybe a car you can sit inside of or a simulator or something more interactive. The cars were amazing and there is a mini theatre where you can watch clips of films the cars have",
          "Took my Huracan from USA to Europe for long planned road trip and drove all over Europe and of course wanted to visit the factory where my car was build and take a picture in front of the museum of my car my wife and me. We were told to not do this and move our car immediately",
          "My son is a car lover and we all enjoyed the Lamborghini Museum and also the factory Tour, which was a guided tour, the girl spoke fluent english and was very thorough with explanations and numbers answered questions and was really great. We really enjoyed the Museum and the",
          "In Bolognese. Took a train & then a taxi out. It is stunning. The buidling is nice and well layed out. History and from the oldest cars are displayed here. Lamborghini's used in movies are on display and even clips of the movie where the car is futures is showed. Trip down",
          "Last year I went to see the Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It was amazing and far exceeded my expectations becoming the bar that I measure all other car museums when I visit them. So now here I am in Bologna, and I had to take a trip to see Lamborghini. What a",
          "Being a petrol head I was at home amongst these beautiful machines. I liked how they mixed in the Lamborghini history with their film history. I was sad I missed the factory tour and the selection of cars they had on show could of been better. I was keen to see a Countach with",
          "What a wonderful experience - seeing the incredibly extensive process of hand- making one of these masterpieces. Loved the factory tour and appreciated our knowledgeable guide. Recommended for any car enthusiast.",
          "Came here for a factory tour and museum visit. The factory tour lasted about an hour and was very informative (tours only in English by the way) there was lots to see and the guides could answer any questions you had. The museum was also interesting however there is only about",
          "The museum is very nice and the factory tour was very interesting. Our guide was very nice and even gave my son a souvenir (Lambo logo stamped in leather from the seats factory section - only for kids). The negative point was the booking. You need to book in advance with",
          "What an enjoyable tour of the factory and to be able to see how the cars are built. being an engineer, I found this a fascinating insight into a great Supercar facility with all the skill and dedication that is put into the build of these cars. Our guide was so knowledgeable",
          "Group of men: 3 adults, 3 teenagers. None of us are real car people but thought visiting the museum and touring the factory may be fun. It exceeded expectations and everyone had a blast. The museum consists of approximately 12-15 cars over two floors. The second floor has",
          "Unbelievable and a experience not to be missed if you love Supercars. The Museum itself is underwhelming but add the factory tour is a must and you will need to pre-book before you go. we booked two months in advance and space was filling up fast.",
          "This was our 2nd stop of the day. Friendly welcome, everything very structured for the tour. We did the factory tour which was very informative and insightful again, no cameras or bags allowed inside. My only complaint was the tour guide was hard to hear at some points, but it",
          "We had the factory and museum your. A little pricy in my opinion, however the combination was well worth the tour. Obviously the smallest of the Italian museums, however it's still worth a visit if your visiting Panini Maserati and Ferrari museums",
          "Loved it. So much luxury and you can see how Italians have amazing design. Also you can see legends as Diablo and Contach",
          "June 2018 - factory tour and museum. At EUR 75 each for a 45 minute tour this might seem a bit pricey but I was rather astonished by the detail that goes into the way this company builds its cars. The factory tour takes you around pretty much every department where you are",
          "This was a fun and interesting experience. Although I am a \"gearhead\", my wife and teen aged kids, who are not interested in supercars, also found this to be a fun outing. Note that we did the factory tour, which was fascinating- the only Italian supercar manufacturer that",
          "...actually the real Lamborghini museum is in Funo, 20 kms east of St Agatha where you will find the history of the company with tractors and many old models and prototypes. If you want to see the recent models, Agatha is the place, but \u20ac15 is a bit much for a showroom without",
          "We have done the whole Italian super car pilgrimage, and particularly the Lamborghini museum and tour and both of which was excellent and definitely a one in a life time experience and all the staff were brilliant and overall Lamborghini leaves Ferrari standing, \u201cgratzi\u201d",
          "This is no museum, merely a couple dozen models old and new scattered over two showroom floors. Little information, no organization, over and out in half hour. Way overpriced and a missed opportunity for such a heavyweight brand.",
          "This is something you can combine with a Ferrari museum. The museum is two floors with the cars in different versions, it's small . you will spend 60 minutes at the most. There is a factory tour what is seriously expensive for a family of four..( we I did not do it)..A nice",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Museum and Factory. The assembly lines included both the Huracan and Aventador. Our guide was very professional and informative, we were also impressed with the precision/detail involved throughout each of the stations! Husband took a 'Spider'",
          "I came here dubious as to what it would be. Not really understanding what I was getting myself into. The museum is exactly that, a hall dedicated to the brand of Lamborghini, as opposed to the merchandise. The history of Lamborghini is on display here, the vehicle are",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to the Lamborghini factory and museum. Demitrios (sp?) was a fantastic guide, full of information and enthusiasm. He drew us in, asking and answering questions throughout the tour. I think the tour lasted about an hour, which was perfect. We saw two",
          "A chance to see the operating type theatre of the making of one of the worlds greatest supercars. The tour takes you through the floor where you see the cars being made which was fascinating for adults and children alike. Tour guide was funny and very interesting",
          "The museum has a reasonable collection on display but did not have the Diablo SE 30th which was a let down. I didn't do the factory tour this time and will definitely do that in my next visit.",
          "I see a mixture of reviews and the ones that did not take the tour are disappointed. I can definitely understand why, The tour is a real highlight, You are brought into the factory and watch the people (mostly young) building the legendary cars. You are taken around in small",
          "This is a wonderfully hosted factory tour. At Ferrari, you see nothing but buildings and the facilities, but at Lamborghini, you walk amongst the cars as they are produced. You meet people who actually make the cars and see the process first hand. First, I highly recommend",
          "I\u00b4m a big fan of Lamborghini, so I was very excited to see the museum. But the experience was a bit different from what I was expecting. I was hoping for a complete history of models, to see all produciton they made. But unfortunatelly there were only picks, so I didint see a",
          "I went this morning . Brilliant . Booked it 4 months ago. Cost me \u20ac65 hotel taxi to factory . The 576 bus stop back is right from entrance , left at the church opposite bar and in the week its 24 mins past the hr. \u20ac13 to bologna. Spotless factory ,200 workers that take 2 days to",
          "The factory tour was definitely worth the money and so was the museum. However I was a little disappointed with the size of the museum. It is just two small floors with maybe 25 cars total. I was very surprised that there was not more detailed information about the history of",
          "Where do you take a super car obsessed 9 year old boy? Here of course. We took the factory tour, conducted by the knowledgeable and lovely Louisa. My Son\u2019s smile was great to see as we walked around for an hour viewing the assembly of the Huracan and Aventador. The museum is",
          "Apart from not having a visitor's parking lot, it's a great display of the Lamborghini heritage. Few cars in two stories, well lit, Well spaced for photo ops. Good explanations near the cars and on the walls. Price is fine and the pre-ordering system worked fine.",
          "Tour of the factory is a must. No robots and you get to walk the line as cars are put together. The tours are limited in size, only 7 people on our tour, and the guide was very informative. There is also a good museum displaying the history of the brand. Visit in late January",
          "went on 27th December so factory was closed, we could only see the museum. About 20 cars in total, no touching allowed which is a challenge with young boys wanting to touch the dream ! Nice cars to look at but kids went around in 15min and then sat down in front of tv showing an",
          "A very small museum with about 15 cars. Not a lot to see besides the cars since the factory tour was closed for the holidays. My husband and son would have been fascinated by this I think.",
          "Very exclusive, very personal museum. It's not crowded with a dedicated guide that will show you all the cars, let you have a peak inside the cars and share with you the fascinating story of each car through the decades. It's a must to visit if you're around the Bologna area.",
          "If you like cars that look amazing and cost more than some countries\u2019 GDP, then you\u2019ll love this. Great historical exhibits and the guided tour was fab too. We were there for a Senna exhibition which added to the experience. The shop merchandise is also way overpriced, but",
          "As an absolute Lambo fan, it was always on my list. Didn't realise there was a waiting list for the factory tour so was hugely disappointed upon arrival to find there were no spaces. BUT the lovely receptionist found 2 spaces the next day and we were able to change our schedule",
          "15 \u20ac for 30 cars. Some relevant models missing. No interaction in the museum - just an exhibition. No signposted parking. Parking far away. No cafe or anything similar. Unfriendly staff outside. They didn't let in a family with a baby buggy due to lack of lift.",
          "Our family busted the money and did the factory tour which was well worth it. We got a real insight into how the Aventador in particular is assembled. Downside it is only 50 minutes. Adults and teenagers at EU$75 a head. Upside is that it is well paced for kids who are",
          "I\u2019m not particularly a Car person but I can appreciate the look of a beautiful piece of machinery and the Lamborghinis are beautiful! It\u2019s a small museum- two floors with maybe ten cars on the ground floor and the race cars and a special exhibit to Senna\u2019s career upstairs. It\u2019s",
          "Took my car crazy brother to the Lamborghini museum and he was in seventh heaven! The staff were extremely helpful and polite plus knowledgeable about the cars. My husband has mobility problems, but found the museum easy to get around, especially with the lift to the upper floor",
          "The museum isn't very big but it's nice place for the car people, a big part of the top floor dedicated to the legendary ayrton senna so it's a must visit for many.",
          "My husband and I did a day trip out of Florence to visit the Lamborghini Museum and Factory Tour while on our honeymoon. Overall we really enjoyed the experience, especially the factory tour. There are about 15 cars that seem to be on permanent display. We attended during the",
          "Museum is quite nice with really nice reception - the best among italian car museums we visited. There is quite funny issue with the parking - you cannot park next to museum, you need to pass it and to park opposite in small street. But gate is open so almost everybody drive in,",
          "Some people have said it is a little disappointing as it is just 2 floors of cars. Why would you expect to see anything else? These are Lamborghini's and look amazing. There is staff around to talk to and ask questions, and a number of race cars from Senna are on display.",
          "If your a car fan this is perfect for you, well it was for me. True the range of cars is not vast but I wasn't expecting it to be, but to see a Muira up close and personal was put of this world. In addition to this there was a Senna exhibition, not Senna being my fav driver, I",
          "We turned up to do the museum and Ayrton Senna collection but were lucky enough to get onto a factory tour. It is almost impossible to get on this without booking in advance but luckily someone had cancelled. This was fantastic and really enjoyable, we saw every stage and these",
          "We visited as independent travellers and not as part of a trip. We were staying in Milan and it was quite a trip to get there using the high speed to train to Bolognese and then opting for a taxi - mainly because the bus would have taken a lot longer although much cheaper. At",
          "I was really impressed by this museum. Very good collection of cars given an overview of what the brand stands for across the history. There was also a 4 doors concept car & SUV displayed. I really loved their designs. Additional to the cars there was also an exhibition & video",
          "If you have been to the Ferrari museum in Modena this is quite the disappointment..... Small, limited cars, poor facilities overall. And I like Lamborghini!",
          "I'm not a car person, but my 12 year old son is, and it turned out that we all enjoyed this museum. It's not a very large museum, but it's nicely done. It's two stories and wasn't very crowded when we were there. I really enjoyed the video about race car driver Ayrton Senna. The",
          "Yes there are a variety of new and old models of car, however it is set in one averagely sized hall over 2 floors and can be looked around in less than half an hour. It was overpriced for what it is, also there is no on site parking (not when I went) so you have to drive down",
          "This is an impeccable collection. Rather small but thats OK. Any Lamborghini is a joy to see and this was one of the highlights of my trip to Italy.",
          "The factory tour lasts about 45 minutes, nearly all spent on the production line (not in the museum). The place is very busy and live, and you get to see many processes of production. The tour guide explains every step fairly thoroughly. She is friendly, knowledgeable and",
          "Beautiful cars but I couldn't see the whole idea of the museum as it's called. It's more like some pretty cars in one place. And it's quite expensive in compered to the amount of the cars. And last but not least. You're one of the most expensive car brand in the world and you",
          "This rather small museum is part of the Lamborghini factory. It shows most of the Models and also some conceptcars. IT is a nice museum with a good layout about 25 km from Modena.",
          "Lamborghini have created many classic and beautiful cars. Here they don't have the resources of Ferrari, but the exhibit is very nice over all and well worth visiting.",
          "Hoped to visit here, Ferrari, and Maserati but only made it to the first two. Not well signed and parking was around the corner. Some amazing cars and a brief history of the brand and founder. Once in a lifetime visit for a fan, but if you're not into these super cars save the",
          "Let's get rid of the Elephant in the Room first: This place is HORRENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE! 300 Euros (in July 2017) for a family of four (with two grown-up kids). That is INSANELY EXPENSIVE to look around a factory and the \"Museum\", with not many cars at all! Also...there's no",
          "Very nice museum right beside the factory but also very good temporary exhibition about Ayrton Senna with many cars that he drove. Come with a baby troller and you will also visit the lift! Entry price is similar to Pagani and Ferrari although much smaller than Ferrari.",
          "We visited the museum and did the factory tour. I agreed to do this for my teenage boys and my husband but I think I ended up enjoying the tour best. It was fascinating to see the assembly line and learn about the production of the cars. Our guide was very knowledgeable and",
          "Going to the Lambo museum for a petrolhead is like going to the Vatican when you are a Christian :) I visited the museum, one of the reasons was the Senna exhibition. The museum is rather small but my son and me had a great time. I am a petrolhead and Lambo are by far the most",
          "It's very small museum with two floor. You can spend around one hour there. If you are a car enthusiast you should definitely go. We went there from Bologna with the local bus (number 576) the bus ticket is 2.90\u20ac per corse and the bus stop is 500 meters from the museum",
          "While we were in the area for the Ferrari Museum we decided to come to the Lamborghini Museum too. It was about the same price as the Ferrari museum, but about a quarter of the size. The cars you get to see there are amazing, and there is also a big exhibition about Ayrton Senna",
          "The museum is very small and a bit meh! There are only a few cars on display and an Ayrton Senna display. However, the factory tour was good so do both of you can or go to the Ferrari Museum which is much better",
          "This is a great place to visit. The cars are amazing and the exhibits are very informative. It gives you a good history of the company, and the names behind the models.",
          "The museum is great, all though we maybe expected a bit more, it was quite small. Unfortunately, we had a break in in our car during our 1-hour visit. That kind of ruined the experience for us, we had just arrived to Italy, and started our vacation with a smashed carwindow and",
          "\u20ac12 entry for students, \u20ac15 for adults. Well worth it as the museum offers an amazing insight into the world of Lamborghini. The background, history and heritage is thoroughly documented and shown throughout the museum, it's incredibly interesting and insightful. Not to mention",
          "This is the Factory museum. They do tours, although no cameras or electronics are allowed in. There is no parking onsite, but there is a place to park about 1km west of the factory (off Via Melmenago). Very nice Collections of cars showing the history of Lamborghini, Plan to",
          "The museum itself had about 20 cars and can be seen easily in 30-40 minutes. They were having a special Senna exhibit with several of his race cars on display. I wouldn't come here just for the museum. The factory tour is a must and takes about 45 minutes! Ferrari does not",
          "Concept cars, prototypes, one-offs, series production cars from the beginning to the lates model - at the Lamborghini Museum the visitor can see many of them, carefully arranged and meticulously kept. The exhibits are changing periodically and contain frequently cars from",
          "This small but perfectly formed. There was a Senna exhibition on which made it really good. Enjoyed it immensely. Worth a trip if you into that sort of thing.",
          "The museum was just OK, BUT: the factory tour was fantastic. It really blew my mind away. I was amazed at how perfect they make their Lamborghini. Yes, the tour is expensive (it includes the museum), but so worth it. Even my daughter, who could care less about cars, enjoyed the",
          "15\u20ac visit is very disappointing, 20 cars tops in the \"museum\", no parking so you have to park in the industrial zone nearby. No interactive contents, just cars like they are in a showroom. 75\u20ac visit looks nice, but 75\u20ac per person seriously ?!",
          "I really enjoyed the museum and the factory tour in which you get to see both assemly lines, not sure if just a museum visit is worth the trip but the factory tour definitely is.",
          "We rented a car and drove up from Florence (about 1.5 hours). Pleasant drive through the mountains. The museum was good, but the factory tour was great! We saw the lines for both current models in production; incredible craftmanship for these hand-made cars. Tip...know the",
          "I stayed in bologna for 5 days and it has been on my bucket list for a long time to visit the Lamborghini factory. I didn't knew that I had to book 10 days in advance for the factory tour. I sent them an email if there was a spot left for that day but every tour was fully",
          "We came to visit on a saturday morning. The museum was what was expected from the supercar manufacturer. Lots of different models (production and prototypes). The Senna display was very good, having been a F1 fan for years. Price was 15 Euro per person. Allocate from 1hr to 3hrs",
          "We followed Ritas recommendation and did the trip ourselves...far cheaper and not difficult at all. Bus was less than 6 euros each return. There were a lot of cars and my 11 year old son enjoyed it. The Senna exhibition was very moving. Disappointed that there was no onsite cafe",
          "this museum was very disaponting i was expecting one of every model made but they only had a handfull of cars.poor value for money.",
          "Very nice visit - it is worth taking the guided tour. Quite a story and wonderful selection of cars. They had the exhibition of Senna there as well and the movie. The movie is 1.5 hours so leave some extra time for that if you can.",
          "I am not a big car fan but we had to do the man tour. I have to admit, it was interesting. If you are a big car fan it is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Great museum for car lovers. It is smaller then Ferrari but worth visiting. Of course if you are not enthusiastic about cars you will be probably dissapointed. But we loved it. Groun floor is about lamborgini cars, the second is mostly about Ayrton Senna. Well presented story.",
          "We honestly came here with really high hopes, but sadly left utterly disappointed. Lamborghini is well known around the globe for its amazing cars, but the museum leaves a lot to be desired. There is no visualization of its history, or of its technology. There's not even any",
          "My wife and I visiting Italy from Australia took the opportunity to visit this museum whilst staying in Modena. We were a little disappointed to find the museum, although 2 floors, was small, didn't have too much detail. At the time, they had on display some cars from the late",
          "While touring Italy, we wanted to give our son a break from art and churches to visit something more up his alley. The museum is quite interesting and worth a visit if you are in the area. The tour, while expensive, is definitely worth it. Lamborghinis are serious cars that",
          "The museum itself is very nice but not very big since Lamborghini obviously hadn't build a big variety of cars. If you go there you absolutely have to do the factory tour. It's very important to book this in advance since it is booked out quite early. The tour itself was an",
          "The museum is interesting but the tour of the production line is unforgettable. Ignore all the specialist tour companies charging 100's of euros to collect you and bring you there. Hire a cheap car rental and drive directly there. The tour tickets aren't cheap but the are 1/10th",
          "2 floors of some special cars await, along with a merchandise showroom. Cars are nicely spaced making photo's easy. Only disappointment was not seeing an Aventador on the floor (other than a shell). They offer a factory tour as well. My only suggestion is they should leave a",
          "We made a special trip from Florence (2 hour drive) to see this museum and we're disappointed with the number of cars displayed. There were just two small rooms of cases. You can't touch the cars or look inside easily. Not worth the time or money unless you are in the area and",
          "If you are into cars. This has to be \" car heaven \" Me and she had a browse around the museum. Wonderful story in the history of super cars. From the 50ies to today. Remarkable progress of the development of sports car / super car technology through the Last 50 years or so.",
          "what more can you say, a room full of Lamborghini's, all mint and immaculate, I wanted to take at least one home with me but wasn't able to",

          "Being a boy's mom (10yo crazy Lambo lover!) I had to open my mind a little! So let's spend some money to go on the Lamborghini's manufacture tour! All I can say is that it was a very well spent $! Not cheap, let's agree! But it was such a great experience! We can go right inside",
          "I stopped here a few days ago by rental car driving from Rome to Venice and back. Bologna is about 90 mins or so from Venice and about 2 hours or so from Rome, not too long of a drive either way. The Lamborghini Countach is solely responsible for my love of cars, beginning",
          "Beautiful place, however it is not very big. Stunning cars! Staff was very friendly during our visit.",
          "This is the other place you must visit when you are in the area. And take the tour though the factory. It is something amazing to see a car being built completely by hand. And if you are lucky, you will get to see and hear one being born. Got double lucky! One Hurricane and one",
          "Not joking, really it is certainly worth coming back to see the place again, especially if you did not visit the factory or did not combine it with the Lamborghini test drive in My Motorland across the street. It is not as big as is Museo Ferrari, but is impressive in any way.",
          "We visited as part of a group (The Italian Job charity event). This is a very modern museum, befitting modern super cars. Plenty of super shiny cars, but I must admit that I missed the old museum which had more of the history of the company, including the tractors. I am a",
          "We visited both the Lamborghini museum and the Ferrari museum when in Modena. We much preferred the Lamborghini museum. The Ferrari museum was extremely touristy, with huge tour groups passing through. It was big, but not very personal - and there were lots of touts outside",
          "Interesting museum, which could be made even more interesting by adding more multi-media content, more space and more information for the visitors",
          "A small museum with two floors of wonderful GT/sporty cars, some whimsical concept cars and a few race cars including a Lamborghini powered Lotus Formula 1. Uncrowded, well laid out and a fine selection made this the Number 2 stop on our trip to the motor valley (Pagani was",
          "We ended up in The area as the skiing was poor and I had my 14 year old daughter to entertain for half term. The weather was awful so sightseeing was off and we ended up in the Lambo Museum. I had been in Stuttgart a few weeks prior and went to Mercedes which is awesome so",
          "Another great automotive museum in the motor valley. the most beautiful and powerful car are here . They are works of art. not a huge place but gorgeous, if you like fast and beautiful cars this place is for you",
          "Was taken here as I had some spare time on a business trip, it is a great place if you are a Lamborghini fanatic, or even a car lover. We were very lucky that a group had cancelled the factory tour so we were invited onto it. Great place to visit",
          "The Lamborghini Museum is not huge but it is packed with some of the most beautiful and powerful cars ever built. The museum has just been redone and is slick and gorgeous. We were graciously welcomed by uniformed staff and had a very pleasant visit. The only downside is",
          "Was expecting so much more to be honest, maybe because i was comparing it to the Ferrari Museum that we visited 2 years ago. It isn't worth visiting.",
          "If you do, this is like being a kid in a candy shop. All of my favourite cars from when I was growing up were there. it is a shame that you are not even allowed to touch them, I know it is a museum but they are right there and you just want to touch. It is a small museum but",
          "Newly renovated with most of the significant models from the story of this legendary company. Well worth the visit and time if you are in the area and like cars. Down to earth friendly staff who are very helpful",
          "Great experience on the emotional side with the chance to see a lot of models of cars that made the history. It's mostly an exhibitions of models of cars but I think it is missing a \"path\" that visitors can follow during their visit. No explanation of the story of the brand, of",
          "Small in scope but worth the stop if your a car person like I . The museum has two floors and about 20 cars and entry was $15. They have some great concept cars and some of the current offerings. Parking is an issue and you need to park in a lot that is small and about 300",

          "A must visit for any petrol head. Well presented museum with some rare examples of models from the company. Parking is a few minute walk away and isn't sign posted so expect to drive in and told where to park by the staff. If you wait long enough you might see a car being driven",
          "We come from Canada so just going to Italy is a trill on its own, but being able to go visit the places your dream cars come from is something else and this museum doesn't disappoint! A small investment for such an experience and to boot the gift store as crazy deals on",
          "The museum offers you a great opportunity to learn about the history of this great car manufacturer and the link with the famous Bulls (that's is correct - most of the car names derives from famous bulls in history). Looks small but with such cars you will be amazed. Factory",
          "I visited the museum on Saturday from bologna train station. So from the bus station = Stazione Autolinee (5 min right from the train station) took the bus No 576 direction of Crevalcore Porta Modena : Ticket one way 3.70 euros from the bus or from the tabac shop (every 1 hour",

          "Have visited for 4 consecutive years and in the last 12 months they've done a refurbishment of the downstairs area which really celebrates the family history of Lamborghini as well as the concepts & future of the brand - they had just brought in the Centenario 10 minutes before",
          "Although we couldnt take the factory tour due to it being shutdown fortnight we thoroughly enjoyed the museum. Firstly, to Address some of the comments in others reviews:- Parking. not obvious. when we visited there were roadworks outside the factory and the gate that looks like",
          "Yes, there is a great big factory, with a sign saying Lamborghini, but there is NO OBVIOUS SIGNAGE for a museum. After asking an irate gate operator, who is rightfully irate because his job is to let goods in and out of a busy factory and not deal with an endless stream of",
          "The museum houses a nice collection of cars but the highlight of this place is the opportunity to walk the factory floor and watch cars actually being built. What a great experience to watch the mechanics at work! The gift shop (located in an adjacent building) has a good range",
          "Be sure that you booked a Factory tour also beside going just to museum. If I have to comapre Lambo museum with the Ferrari in Maranello, Ferrari is the winner here but if you go the the factory here and see the Lambos in productions then it is a whole new story. Keep in mind if",
          "Catarina was amazing very friendly very professional ... you will feel like she is a family member .This tour with Catarina is a must and its once in a life time experience . thank you so much Catarina, everything was exceptional u really did a great job in every single way to",
          "Exceeded my expectations. Opportunity to get up close with iconic cars from the past like the Miura and Countach that were posters on my bedroom wall, to the latest concept designs that looked like the Batmobile. Even the wife loved it, and thats saying something. There is",
          "We visited the museum and attended the factory tour. I would give six stars for the factory tour. Yes, you are not allowed to bring your phone or camera, but they walk you right through the middle of the production line. In our case for the top of the line model, the Aventador.",
          "We visited Lamborghini within a few hours of finishing the factory tour at Ducati (about 20 minutes drive away). Unfortunately the Lamborghini tour was the opposite of the Ducati tour - and not in a good way. The staff are snobs and our tour guide reminded me of a young Frau",
          "Compared to what Ferrari has put together, this museum and factory tour is way overpriced for what you get. Nice cars but not worth it. $180 euros for a family of 4 ( $270 CND!! ). Shame on Lamborghini for this swindle!! They can learn a lot from Ferrari!",
          "If you are planning to do most of the car museums around Modena, I would do this one first, mainly because, after the two Ferrari museums and the amazing Panini collection, it was a disappointment. There are somr great cars here, including concepts you'll never see anywhere",
          "We tried to book a tour of the factory in advance, but weren't successful. We decided to add a diversion in our trip to the museum and try again there to get a tour. No such luck. You have to pay to go in the museum snd for a family of 4 it was about 60 Euros. They just have",
          "If you love cars you should visit the Lamborghini museum in Sant'Agata Bolgonese. You will find here all cars that were produced from this brand. And yes, there're not that many but what do you excpet? Lamborgini has only produced 17 models since 1964. Additionally to that you",
          "Lamborghini assembled a very very impressive collection of cars including iconic ones and few that was only for showoff, all with a short story behind the model. if you are a car lover - make the effort and go there (it is not in the center of something) I had a small issue",
          "Overall, I had a great time with my factory tour and museum visit. The factory tour was amazing and I love the fact that Lamborghini does not use any robots to put the car together. It is all done by the employees. The only robot is a little trolley that brings the chassis",
          "This morning we visited Ferrari which on comparison with the afternoons visit to Lamborghini was a five. Signposted in town (Lamborghini no), parking available outside (Lamborghini 250 m away but free), \u20ac30 for two is the same for both. Cheery entrance staff on both, but",
          "This tour was really great! We started walking through the museum (where you can take as many pictures as you want of the cars) on our way to the factory. Inside the factory we walked through different areas on a specific path (for safety reasons) and saw all the different",
          "On two levels but has lift (ask for key from staff). Models from 1960s to present day plus concept cars. Very enjoyable tour. Factory tour available at extra cost.",
          "Fantastic to be able to go into the factory and see up close the assembly of the cars,shop mega expensive for the ordinary joe,parked across the road on a dirt track,came out to find the anti tourist squad had given us a ticket,but who cares after such an expierience,cafe would",
          "Well worth checking out if your in the area. Great detail in the factory tour and amazing to see where they are made. Great to cars still been handmade.",
          "This is a fantastic pair. The factory Lamborghini museum is excellent, with a good range of older and newer cars, plus some concept vehicles and bare chassis. The display signs are very good - not full of technical detail - sadly no museums are there days - but it is a great",
          "Very expensive for what is there. The cars are beautiful but there are not very many. We expected a better display with more cars. It's just a show room with a small selection.",
          "We arrived at the opening hour of the museum at 10:00 and got in with the reduced fee of 12 euros. We were not even given a ticket to get in just the receipt could be used to get inside. The museum has two floors with just cars. It's quite a small exhibit actually. There is",
          "We did the factory tour and the museum. Factory tour must be booked online and is a great experience. The museum is just like a candy store for a kid ;-)",
          "Cars exhibition is completely awesome. Cars are spectacular, its not so big but still you can see almost every Lamborghini model. It would be great if you could touch or get in a car but unfortunately that is not allowed.",
          "Did the Lamborghini factory tour with my son as an 18th Birthday treat, got there an hour early on purpose and did the museum first. Parking not obvious but parked on the dirt road exactly opposite the Lamborghini sign (on the roof) with loads of other cars. Museum is excellent",
          "We have just returned from a short break in Bologna, were we visited both Lamborghini and Pagani. The Lamborghini tour was very professional and to see these wonderful cars being made was amazing, and then to see the old and new models is definitely worth a trip, then only",
          "The museum is a very old fashioned, lot of cars sitting around that you can't interact with... now, the factory tour is worth seeing.",
          "Visited the Lamborghini Musuem and Factory with my friend. This was such a pleasure and unforgettable. Much better factory tour than the Ferrari tour. What a great experience!",
          "First of all, how can a car museum not have parking for visitors? With the money they spend employing a security guard to turn away the cars entering the driveway (I counted a dozen or more during my visit) they could provide a car park. And at \u20ac15 per visitor they should.",
          "Once I knew I was going to be in Italy I had no choice but to go visit the Lamborghini Factory/Museum, as I am an avid car enthusiast. You must book a date and time with them in advance in you want to take a tour of the factory, otherwise you'll most likely only be able to",
          "Not the easiest of places to get to if you do not have a car ,but it can be done by bus but beware you only have one bus back,What a fantastic selection of cars ,just takes your breath away.If you want to visit the factory you will have to pre book as we found out.Well worth the",
          "Lamborghini has been a car that I have loved since I was a child. I was in Bologna for 2 days and found that I could visit this museum.. First, there is NO EASY WAY there if you do not have a car. Taxi is expensive and the bus only runs every hour and it is another hour ride on",
          "Any sports car enthusiast should take the time to walk through the museum and do the guided factory tour. The factory itself is impressive and spotless. The cars are gorgeous and hearing the cars being tested in the streets are awesome. I however found it a little expensive",
          "One of the highlights of my trip to Italy... You can either pay to visit the museum (15Euro) you pay a few Euros more to have a guided tour but that's not really necessary in my opinion. I highly recommend the factory tour. It is a bit pricey but you will not regret it... It is",
          "Too much expensive considering the number of cars available. Probably some foreign travelers can be excited because is inside the Lamborghini facility but really in Italy there are more interesting car museums to visit before this one.",
          "Took my son here as he is a car fanatic. The Museum is a bit far out and not very easy to travel to. There is a bus that goes from Bologna to the Museum. A tour of the factory is optional but the cars in the museum tell the history of Lamborghini and provide excellent photo",
          "The museum itself was ok but what made it really worth while was the factory tour. They brought us through the production line of how two lines of Lambo was made (only 5 and 10 cars assembled per day). Great explanations given and also see how much craftsmanship at every stage",
          "I would have to agree with other raters regarding the museum only tour; it would not be sufficient and the factory tour is a must when visiting. I was able to get reservations for the tour and we were truly impressed with the organization and efficiency of the factory. The",
          "Website wasn't very clear as the link to the booking form was in a very slightly lighter shade of grey than the info itself. Consequently I was unable to get on the factory tour. The museum itself was ok but unless you were a Lamborghini geek you would probably get as much out",
          "We finally located the quite large factory after leaving Bologna (which itself is worth a 3 or 4 days stay) & getting lost several times (hand-held navigation device couldn't cope with the Italian directions & streets). The Receptionist/cashier had a great sense of humour & was",
          "My wife and I went to the Lamborghini factory expecting a canned tour and a few visuals. Little did we realize that we would tour the entire plant and see virtually everything. Amazingly, the cars are still produced by hand - no robots in sight. The floors were so clean that",
          "One of the more expensive museum and factory tours (compared to Ducati and Ferrari) but well worth it. The factory tour we went on was provided in English and took us through the factory floor where you see the two production lines running for the Aventador and Huracan. For car",
          "I found the Lamborghini museum to be so so. It has a two floors just like show room of a car dealer. Not particularly impressive but the entrance is free. What made up for is the factory tour. It is a little expensive at 40 euro each person but you got to see real cars in",
          "Beautiful cars, like the Superleggera and the amazing new Urus SUV, but their Countach was out on loan. That's ok though, there's one on display at Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport. The Sesto Elemento was great to see up close. The factory tour was excellent, covering the",
          "We went here as part of a supercar day. We toured the factory floor as well as the museum. Four and a half stars for the factory tour (minus a half star because it was hard to hear the guide if you weren't right next to her; headphones would have solved this issue). The",
          "Parking is relatively remote (~300 meters) which is not very nice on a rainy day. Entry price relatively expensive when considering the value (especially in comparison with Ferrari and Ducati museum, which were much better to my opinion). Overall - nice experience, but",
          "We were visiting Bologna, Italy and we had an opprtunity to visit Lamborghini museaum and factory tour. The museum contained some familiar and classic models and some unknown models. Some of the models were unique pieces (only one was built). Never the less all cars looked",
          "This museum was very overrated. They did have quite a few impressive cars, but it was over-priced for what you get. After looking at the cars for a while, it gets a little boring. The bathroom situation was a mess too. We stood in line for a long time - only one very small",
          "We decided to come here as a last minute decision on our way to the Ducati Factory, the price was 13 euro just for the museum and 40 euro for the Factory tour combined. We purchased tickets for the museum only as we thought it was a steep seen as Ducati was 10 euros for both",
          "Fantastic factory tour, well worth it and great value for money at only Euro40 each. I thought my husband was going to explode with excitement. We wanted to visit the factory whilst staying in Venice but could only find private tours for Euro600 each. So we ended up staying in",
          "I'm not entirely sure what I expected from this museum, but definitely not few cars for \u20ac9 entrance fee. This being a tribute to Lamborghini felt more like some collectors garage. Staffs attitude and dress code didn't help either. All in all I don't regret going there, but",
          "The museum provides an opportunity to look at some of Lamborghini's stunning creations. I wish the museum could have been a little more comprehensive, or maybe if the cars had been presented in a way that showed the evolution of the Lamborghini style over time. There was very",
          "I love it. We get in to the factory and have a ture inside, it was great to saw and get an explanations abut the cars line . Our side you can see new Lamo coming out. I frefer this museum then the others.",
          "The cars were so amazing! We had a blast but, we missed out on the tour which we should have booked in advance. This was a huge mistake. Although, we did really enjoy the cars. Out timing was pretty unfortunate because, all the restaurants around that area close by 3 o'clock and",
          "This museum is compact but the cars and their presentation are beautiful. My daughter and teenage daughter went on the factory tour and loved it. Really interesting, walk round the factory and very informative. My younger daughter and I found plenty to keep us amused looking at",
          "Great museum and well worth the trip to see the cars dating back to 1963, on display. Even better was the factory tour and commentary from Valentina. What a remarkable facility, run with all the precision, care and attention to detail required and demanded to produce such a fine",
          "Unfortunately, the few days we were in the area the factory tour was booked out by coach tour companies so we missed out. We did tour the museum and it was very interesting, I saw my first four door Lambo! I think the factory tour would have made this great so make sure you",
          "Despite having a 2015 Trip Advisor centre of excellence, Trip Advisor website sent us to the wrong address (nearby). Otherwise its pretty much spot on. It seems slightly odd to be charged by Lamborghini to look at their portfolio of work but they were very helpful and the place",
          "Booked our tickets for this tour on line in UK. Easy to get to from Bologna Bus Station on the 576 bus and a 5 minute walk to the Lamborghini Museum. When we arrived the car park was full of Lamborghini cars and their owners - we think on a road tour. The museum is on a",
          "We were looking for something different to do with our boys as we had planned mostly \"typical\" sightseeing stops. The tour was a little pricey but worth it. There were 6 of us and we all enjoyed it. Very interesting and we got to get way closer to the assembly part of the",
          "A group visit to the Motor Valley - how can one not tour Lamborghini? The factory is exciting - both Aventador and Hurucan being created - all the flashy colors for both interior & exterior, the bespoke options, and the blend of automation and craftsmanship. The museum is",
          "The tour and visit to the museum were really good. The factory tour does involve a w allaying tour of the actual Lamborghini assembly plant. We got to see the process of the Aventador being built, in various phases. It was really cool to see how this car is out together. The",
          "We visited both the museum and the factory. It was a guided tour through the assembly line where you can see how the aventador sv is made! A nice woman explained to us beatiful details about how lamborghinis are made and about the brand's history. To walk among the workers who",
          "The factory tour was absolutely AMAZING. We were so glad to get in before they shut down for August. Sign up for tours early...totally worth it. Every car is custom designed and built by hand and we got to see every step along the way, including a completed car rolling off the",
          "Agree with previous posters that to get the most out of visiting the Lamborghini museum you MUST have a reservation to visit the factory. It is there that you get a true sense of the craftsmanship that goes into making each of these cars. The museum portion, hosts about 25+ cars",
          "If you would like to visit the factory, be prepared and book minimum 1 month in advance!!! We missed it and only could see the museum, which is only 20-25 cars and some engines, which is interesting, but not a big WAW!",
          "While not as well presented as the Ferrari museum, to see all these amazing cars under one roof is fantastic! Unfortunately the factory floor tour was closed during my visit so I missed out, but if I'm ever back in Italy I'll definitely return to check it out. I would",
          "Firstly this is an amazing day if you see the museum and are booked on the factory tour. The factory tour is fantastic and the guides are superb. We had Christina and her English was superb and she threw in lots of humour. You can get up close to Aventadors being made and the",
          "Our main objective of this trip was to arrive at the Lamborghini museum and factory. Entrance was 40 euros per person. You need to coordinate you visit to the Factory tour just on the safe side.",
          "The museum holds some new/older/old Lamborghini cars that are nice to see. There's also three old F1 cars, a police Lamborghini and some other. It's a small museum though, no so many exhibits. The Ferrari Museum in Marranello is much much better. Factory tour on the other hand",
          "The highlight of our day - high praise considering we also went to Ferrari and Pagani. We paid \u20ac40 each meaning we got the museum and also the factory visit. The museum has a great collection of concept and one off cars (maybe 30 in total) but it was the factory tour that was",
          "Good place to visit for all motor sport fans, no other activities to fo around the area. About 40 minutes drive from Bologna",
          "We didn't know that you can reserve to see the factory, so by the time we figured that out, the only times they had available was when we had returned home. We still went to visit the museum and it was interesting to see two floors of Lambhorghini on display. Is it like the",
          "A very luxurious place! We did the factory tour and we were impressed how we could actually see the cars being made. 4,8 cars per day! And you should visit this before Ferrari.. And the parking is around the corner for free. But it is so much more fun than ferrari! Ferrari is",
          "Having visited Ducati and Ferrari, was really looking forward to this tour. Yes parking is not available on site (despite big empty car part at front of building). Free parking 500yards down the road. Museum has a display of stunning cars where you can wander and dream.",
          "Visit this museum after Ferrari museum and was very disappointed. First of all, there is no parking for visitors. You are told to park your car across the road on some desolated street and go by foot. There is crosswalk on the road near the museum. Directions are not really",
          "amazing cars, just cars without the world of merchandise that this places usually have for boys and men that are still boys... this ais a very special car in all it's versions",
          "Being an owner myself, I couldn't think of a better way to spend an afternoon! Unfortunately, the 2 hr tour was cut to 1hr because one production line was off limits. I knew this going in however, was told a few weeks prior to my arrival that it was open. The tour guide on the",
          "the tour was great, we could follow the steps of the staff. the museum is wonderful, a lot of cars, antiques and concepts.",
          "What a wonderful tour we had with Valentina. It was amazing to be able to watch the cars being made. Valentina was knowledgeable and answered our questions. My son loved looking at the cars in the museum as well. We recommend the Lamborghini tour!",
          "a must for car lovers. this is an easy 2 hr trip from Florence. very enjoyable. We used Nicolai limousine. Was well worth it as we stopped at a balsamic vinegar factory",
          "The museum was average, the space is small and crowded for their cars. It will be better if there is dedicated building for their exhibits and more information about the company's history. Fantastic cars though.",
          "We had a tour ordered in advance but this fact didn't bother them to reschedule us for one hour later .This fact is a sign of dis-respect ,we arrived here specially to see the cars and then we had to continue ,we arrived very late at our hotel because of this delay. The parking",
          "We were very fortunate to do the Lamborghini factory tour with Valentina. She was knowledgeable and her passion for the cars was evident. There were several children in our group and she was wonderful with them as well. I'm sure that if any of them can ever afford a",
          "Visited here having pre-booked a factory tour on the Lamborghini website which was very easy, although is very popular so hard to get a spot when we wanted but got there after a couple of tries. Absolutely must pre book the factory tour otherwise you will be disappointed. Before",
          "Even its not that big the building itself and the enviroment is so calm and elegant while knowing new lamborghinis are producing few meters away.. \u0130f you are car guy or girl you definately need to visit. !!!",
          "We were running real late due to delays at the Pagani factory tour. Fortunately, we made it just in time, 10min before closing time. The museum is not very big, over 2 floors. We managed to snap pictures of the cars. We did not manage to book the factory tour though. So book",
          "Visited today an had a superb time, some top tips that I hope help fellow potential visitors as after doing some research caught train from Bologna central station for 3 euro each to San Giovanni in Persiceto and then asked at small cafe at railway station and they ordered taxi",

          "We didn't get a spot in the tour of the factory, but that did not matter! The museum features past Lamborghini's, engines and a stack of information and facts. When we were there a few of the new models were in the car park being revved up and shown off, amazing! Also walk to",
          "A place that must visit if you stay in Italy for some days. You can try to visit also car's assembly line in the factory. Reservations are needed.",
          "The Lamborghini museum in Sant'Agata is an unforgettable experience. As a kid my first love was the mighty Countach and it still is today. Chalk it up to the brand's rarity or just dumb luck, I have never been in the presence of these mighty vehicles until now. The experience",
          "Even if you're not a car fan do yourself a favour and go on a tour of the Lamborghini factory. It was a fantastic experience walking through the factory, only a few feet away from where these incredible cars are made. Groups are small (ours was 6 people) and the guide gave us",
          "The exhibits prove, that Italians still have best artist. These cars are not only a tribute to speed but also icons of best design. Fascinating cars inside the museum and on the street in front of factory during test drives.",
          "Factory closed for tours during our visit. Therefore we could only view the small showroom of cars. Small information on the cars but no other media like videos.",
          "If you like cars and especially Lamborghini, this is a must do. They are all on display, some looking fanstastic and others maybe not to your taste. All of them in the design frontline. No touching, no driving but you can keep on dreaming. They are waiting for you...",
          "I will start by stating that I am an automotive design student, so this was magical for me to see these works of art in person. The Cars are essentially in a showroom format and you can walk around freely and take as many photos as you want. It is a smaller collection of cars,",
          "My wife and I drove over from Piza. I have always wanted to go here. it is out in the country and a few times doubted the GPS but we made it and it was awesome. The collection of cars (and trucks) was more than I expected. Plan on some time here as if you want to read about",
          "Lamborghini factory museum hosts a collection of some amazing cars, from Miura, through Countach and Diablo to Reventon, which provide magnificent sights, yet there are many models that you know and just can't find there, so for me it was not enough. Also, the descriptions of",
          "Even my wife liked it! We drove down from Verona as this was one of the highlights (for me) of our vacation. Very impressive. Parking is a few hundred meters from the museum entrance. A nice gentleman will flag you down and let you know where to park if you pull into the",
          "Excellent combination of museum and factory tour. Cars are well displayed and they have a shop adjacent to the main showroom. You also get a free show of the new Lamborghini's being road tested outside.",
          "The museum was amazing! The bottom floor had approx 20 production models and the top floor had approx. 10 prototypes. 13 Euro each to enter and SO easy to get to. From Bologna, take the 576 bus and get off at Sant\"Agata Bolognese. Walk to the traffic lights and turn RIGHT,",
          "I had a special tour arranged a day before the actual visit to the plant. We went through the history of all the Lamborghini cars, what made them unique, which ones were prototypes and which ones were clay models. Unless you look closely, you won't see the real one from the clay",
          "I think it' s a beautiful place where appreciate Lamborghini style story from Miura to the last fantastic models. Everything near the factory and a little boutique full of gadgets lambo marked. I've stayed there with my family and little kids was enthusiastic !!!! For cars and",
          "This museum had been the top of my husband's wish list when we planned our trip to Italy and he wasn't disappointed. Our research prepared us for the fact that it was quite small and that it would be a \"look, don't touch\" kind of place so we weren't surprised (after all, think",
          "Probably not worth the admission fee, but just to hang around the gates waiting for the test-drivers to take the cars out on the road tests is worth the trip. Car parking not the best, staff (exception of test pilots) miserable.",
          "Visited from Verona, July 2014, with family of 4, at the urging of dad and son, age 8, who loves cars. The museum closes from 12-1330. There are about 20 cars on display, and you cannot touch or sit in any of them. The cars are indeed beautiful, but mom and daughter were bored.",
          "It was like a dream coming true! Since I was a little boy, Lamborghini was THE car for me. When I first saw a golden Lamborghini Diablo, I felt in love for the brand. Reaching the Museum/Factory is easy. I went by bus from Bologna and walked a little bit down the road. The city",
          "An easy drive from Bologna, around 45 minutes. The museum is closed from 1230 until 1330 so time it right. A great collection of one offs and concept cars. Would have been more enjoyable to see the factory but it's closed until next year. Would say the entrance fee is a little",
          "As I was planning our trip to Italy, I asked my husband what would interest him. He requested we visit a couple of the exotic car manufacturers. So we took a day trip from Florence to visit both the Lamborghini Museum and the Ferrari Museum. I'd been lead to believe that",
          "The museum itself was great. The actual tour of the factory was brilliant but this could have been a bit longer. A tip is to allocate some extra time especially in the beginning as it really is a special experience.",
          "Having just been on the Pagani Factory tour prior to visiting Sant A'gata and sadly the museum this was a massive let down. Two small floors with about 20 cars on show. Didn't even have the new Hurican on show. Ten minutes and we had seen it all! Save the admission and stand",
          "We took the bus from Bologna Bus station (so easy and about 12 euros round trip for two of us- cheap!!). We booked a factory tour about 3-4 months before our trip. You need to book well in advance and I think the factory is relocating now so tours are unavailable until after",
          "Extraordinary museum with lot of old cars, formula and much more, presented through all the years of racing and street performance for the most demanding customers and drivers. Easy to find. Just follow sign to Sant'Agata Bolognese, Last year fee was 11 EUR but it worth it every",

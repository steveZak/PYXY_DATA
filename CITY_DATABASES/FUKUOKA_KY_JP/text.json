        "wiki": "\u014chori Park (\u5927\u6fe0\u516c\u5712, \u014chori-k\u014den) is a park in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Fukuoka, Japan and a registered Place of Scenic Beauty.The name \u014chori means a large moat and it derives from the fact that Kuroda Nagamasa, the old lord of Fukuoka, reclaimed the northern half of a cove or an inlet called Kusagae which was facing Hakata Bay and made a moat for the Fukuoka Castle.  At the same time the Hii (Tajima) River, which was flowing into the cove, was diverted from its course to the west.\nThe present park was reconstructed by Fukuoka City, modeled on the West Lake of China, and opened in 1929. A fireworks festival is held here every August. \nThe Fukuoka Art Museum and the United States Consulate are nearby.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\u014chorik\u014den Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)\nOhori Park - Yokanavi.com\nFukuoka Travel:Ohori Park - Japan-guide.com",

          "The park itself is huge with lots of tree and wonderful lake ... but don't recommend to go in the summer as there are not many shaded areas... I like walking in the middle of the lake... it felt nice to be away from the city..and cool breeze helped with the heat of summer",

          "We started our afternoon walk from the castle and then passed a green playground to arrive at the big lake surrounded by a wide road for walking, jogging or cycling, colored with sunflowers and typical Asian willows. There are plenty of benches to have a rest. This is a place to",

          "We brought our kids to the Art Museum and the children playground. The kids naturally thought playing in the park was much better than shopping in a department store. Even though it was a scalding hot day. There are bridges that span across the lake, which make the park a bit",
          "Ohori park may not be as iconic as Shinjuku gyoen, but it's as relaxing as a small town park. Not a lot of tourists here. THere's a pink berry and a couple of restaurants at the edge of the lake. The lake is huge, very nice to jog. But on a hot summer day, people would rather",

          "We went just to see the place and was quite taken with the size of the park in Central Fukuoka. If outdoor activities is what you want to do, then this is the place. But the weather now - sunny- and the heat is not a good combination to enjoy the place.",

          "This is a nice big park located right in the middle of the city and easily within reach via the subway. Though it is not really that fantastic - perhaps due to the time of my visit in Jun 2016 when not many flowers are in bloom - it offers a serene and quiet getaway from the",

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector.

It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

          "The area around it is beautiful, with the sea, the dome and many restaurants and caf\u00e9s, but in winter it was a bit empty. The tower is just a tall building to enjoy the view of the bay, but to be honest it didn't seem to be worth the ticket.",

          "A great way to get a bird-eye view of the city. The view is beautiful. During the night, the building lights up according to the season. I was there during the winter, and the building had a Christmas tree shaped light up on its building. Its was really cool.",

          "I went by myself, and found the staff so kind. The woman at the main desk, the women in the elevators who gave their information in Japanese then in English for me, the lone westerner. The view is pretty hard to beat. I went on a sunny day and you could see for miles in all",
          "We went there on sunset. Cost is about 800 yen. Great view from the top. Very nice city on the coast There is a restaurant there but we did not try it",

          "It's literally the highest point in the city with a restaurant on top. There's also a 7-11 at the base of the tower and it's near the board walk. You can't visit Fukuoka without coming here.",
          "The Fukuoka Tower is not as tall as those in Shanghai, but it is still a worthwhile visit to see this beautifully designed glass structure. From the outside, the architecture is very modern with clean lines and lots of glass in it's design. From the top, there are impressive",
          "During our trip, the weather was so nice so we wanted to have a nice view of the city. The view is nice but we were a bit disappointed as the tower is not that high. But if you have nothing to do for 20 min, you can go up !",
          "Tower has been gone, only if this was in the movies, LOL :), I guess, and the story goes on as the whole city was destroyed, OMG!!! Fukuoka Tower is here and still provides all around look at this charming and beautiful city with the mountains on one side and the cove, I took",

          "This is a lovely (yet ordinary) tower, located by the sea. While the view from the tower is nice, you don't really have to go up the tower - just go to the nearby Hilton hotel and get the exact same views. Having said that, the tower does look beautiful at night, when it is",
          "Another tower, another view. Fukuoka doesn't have the best view ever but you know it's still fun to be s high above the seashore. This is not Tokyo sky tree so not a lot of co-visitors.",

The few of the sunset and the night skyline is gorgeous. ",

          "Probably one of the nicest shrines we visited (based on proximity to our hotel). It is located next to the Kawabata shopping arcade, and I must note, it sees a large amount of foot traffic due to that and also its proximity to a major street. It was definitely the busiest",
          "If you are into shrines and temples, you will find Kushida Shrine worth a visit. It is also the starting point of the Hakata Gion Yamakase festival so if you come at the right time, you may see the huge floats specially decorated for the occasion. Around the shrine are many",

          "This is a must go place in Fukuoka! It's amazing work they did. I wish I was there during the festivals but I'm sure it's too crazy busy to watch. I loved their Yamagasa and it's beautiful.",

          "With so many temples and shrines in Japan it's helpful to choose on different criteria which ones to go and see. I'd recommend the Kushida Shrine because of its proximity to the Hakata Station and other shrines in the area. There is a Japanese float on the premises which was",

          "Walk 15 to 20 minutes from the station towards the Canal city mall area. I found this place interesting that it is just in the middle of the city. If you do not really want shopping while in Hakata and it would be a good idea going there.",
          "This is quite a steep climb of 20 minutes from the subway station but well with it. The shrine is nice and the views very good.",
          "To be honest, this shrine is not like the others with so many points of difference which would make it so much more interesting if it wasn't so small. Chinese zodiac animal motifs everywhere already set this shrine apart from all the others I visited, but there's even a little",

          "I purchased a 1-day subway ticket and visited various shrines/temples in Fukuoka that were fairly convenient to reach on foot from a subway station. While this shrine was quite interesting, it did not seem to stand out much against the several others I viewed that day. Perhaps",
          "Had the luck to arrive at sunset, which added a magic touch to the already solemn experience of visiting a well-kept small temple in the middle of the city. Was just surprised (and a bit disappointed) to see a row of ugly soft drink distributors within the premises. Nice to see",

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia.

The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals. The costumes are worn with pride and are considered appropriate wear for even formal occasions, such as weddings and cocktail parties, during the festival.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Hakata Dontaku ====\nHakata Dontaku (\u535a\u591a\u3069\u3093\u305f\u304f) is held in Fukuoka City on May 3 and 4.

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded.

The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

It was sometimes called Chikush\u016b (\u7b51\u5dde) or Chikuy\u014d (\u7b51\u967d), with Chikugo Province. Chikuzen bordered Buzen, Bungo, Chikugo, and Hizen Provinces.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original provincial capital is believed to be near Dazaifu, although Fukuoka city has become dominant in modern times.\nAt the end of the 13th century, Chikuzen was the landing point for a Mongol invasion force. But the main force was destroyed by a typhoon (later called kamikaze).\nIn April 1336, Kikuchi Taketoshi attacked the Shoni clan stronghold at Dazaifu.  At the time, the Shoni were allied with Ashikaga Takauji in his battles against Go-Daigo.  The Shoni were defeated, which led to the suicide of several clan members, including their leader Shoni Sadatsune.In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures.  Maps of Japan and Chikuzen Province were reformed in the 1870s.  At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes.  For example, Chikuzen is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Shrines and temples ==\n\nSumiyoshi-jinja and Hakosaki-g\u016b (Hakozaki Shrine?) were the chief Shinto shrines (ichinomiya) of Chikuzen.\n\n\n== Historical districts ==\nFukuoka Prefecture\nGeza District (\u4e0b\u5ea7\u90e1) - merged with Johza and Yasu Districts to become Asakura District (\u671d\u5009\u90e1) on February 26, 1896\nHonami District (\u7a42\u6ce2\u90e1) - merged with Kama District to become Kaho District (\u5609\u7a42\u90e1) on February 26, 1896\nIto District (\u6021\u571f\u90e1) - merged with Shima District to become Itoshima District (\u7cf8\u5cf6\u90e1) on February 26, 1896\nJohza District (\u4e0a\u5ea7\u90e1) - merged with Geza and Yasu Districts to become Asakura District on February 26, 1896\nKama District (\u5609\u9ebb\u90e1) - merged with Honami District to become Kaho District on February 26, 1896\nKasuya District (\u7cdf\u5c4b\u90e1)\nKurate District (\u978d\u624b\u90e1)\nMikasa District (\u5fa1\u7b20\u90e1) - merged with Mushiroda and Naka Districts to become Chikushi District (\u7b51\u7d2b\u90e1) on February 26, 1896\nMunakata District (\u5b97\u50cf\u90e1) - dissolved\nMushiroda District (\u5e2d\u7530\u90e1) - merged with Mikasa and Naka Districts to become Chikushi District on February 26, 1896\nNaka District (\u90a3\u73c2\u90e1) - merged with Mikasa and Mushiroda Districts to become Chikushi District on February 26, 1896\nOnga District (\u9060\u8cc0\u90e1)\nSawara District (\u65e9\u826f\u90e1) - dissolved\nShima District (\u5fd7\u6469\u90e1) - merged with Ito District to become Itoshima District on February 26, 1896\nYasu District (\u591c\u9808\u90e1) - merged with Geza and Johza Districts to become Asakura District on February 26, 1896\n\n\n== See also ==\nFukuoka Domain\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and K\u00e4the Roth.

It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub.

It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams.

        "wiki": "Hakata-ku (\u535a\u591a\u533a) is a ward of the city of Fukuoka in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.\nMany of Fukuoka Prefecture and Fukuoka City's principal government, commercial, retail and entertainment establishments are located in the district. Hakata-ku is also the location of Fukuoka's main train station, Hakata Station, Fukuoka Airport and the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakata-ku is a ward of Fukuoka City located on its eastern edge. It is 31.47 km2 with a population of 206,629 (current January 1, 2009). Much of the ward consists of low-lying plains beside the Mikasa River (\u5fa1\u7b20\u5ddd, Mikasagawa). The northwestern end of the ward faces Hakata Bay, which includes both ferry and international cruise ship terminals Hakata Harbor (\u535a\u591a\u6e2f, Hakata k\u014d). The northeast end of the ward is slightly elevated, and is named Higashihirao (\u6771\u5e73\u5c3e), with nearby Fukuoka Airport. Around Hakata Station is downtown; Nakasu (\u4e2d\u6d32) is the main dining and entertainment district of the ward along the Naka River (\u90a3\u73c2\u5ddd, Nakagawa). Hakata-ku also houses the Fukuoka Prefectural office.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nMany Japanese companies have established branch offices in Hakata-ku due to its ease of access to local government offices as well transportation hubs such as Hakata Station and Fukuoka Airport. The headquarters of JR Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Best Denki, and many other companies are in the ward.Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered on the grounds of Fukuoka Airport in Hakata-ku. Link Airs has its headquarters in the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building (\u798f\u5ca1\u7947\u5712\u7b2c\u4e00\u751f\u547d\u30d3\u30eb Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Biru) in Hakata-ku. Cisco has an Asia-Pacific sales office on the 12th floor of the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building.Prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was headquartered on the grounds of the airport in Hakata-ku.Hakata's economy was significantly transformed in 1996 with the opening of Canal City Hakata, an award-winning destination shopping and entertainment center.\n\n\n=== Cruise ship tourism ===\nFrom the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China.\nIn 2014, 91 cruise ships travelled from China called at Hakata. In 2015, 245 cruise ship calls were made at Hakata Port. After expansion and redevelopment of the port facilities, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400. As of 2015, the largest passenger vessel making regular port calls at Hakata is the Royal Caribbean International owned MS Quantum of the Seas.\nPartly as a result of growing international tourism, in 2015 Fukuoka reported the fastest rising tax revenues and population in Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nHakata is one of the oldest cities in Japan. In the Middle Ages Hakata, which faces onto the Genkai-Nada Channel (\u7384\u754c\u7058) dividing Japan from Korea, was a base for merchants who traded with China and Korea, and the city housed Japan's first Chinatown. Taira no Kiyomori is said to have built the artificial harbor Sode-no-minato (\u8896\u306e\u6e4a) to increase commerce. Hakata was burned down by many wars, including the Mongol invasions.\n\nIn the early Edo period, Kuroda Nagamasa, appointed the lord of Chikuzen Province, and most of his samurai vassals lived in Fukusaki, on the opposite shore of the Naka River from Hakata. Kuroda Nagamasa changed the name of the area to Fukuoka after his home town; Fukuoka in Okayama Prefecture. He ordered Tachibana Castle and Najima Castle dismantled, and had Fukuoka Castle built using the stones from those older castles. At that time Hakata was no larger than one square kilometer, demarcated by defensive lines along the Naka River, the Boshu-bori (or Boshu Canal), and the Ishido or Mikasa River.\nIn 1876, Hakata, then also known as Dai-Ni-Dai-ku, and Fukuoka, or Dai-Ichi-Dai-ku, were merged. In 1878 the settlement was renamed Fukuoka-ku (\u798f\u5ca1\u533a) by the Fukuoka prefectural government, though the population of Hakata was 25,677 and that of Fukuoka was 20,410. At that time, the name Hakata vanished from the administration. In 1889, after a local referendum in which half the voters chose the name Fukuoka and half chose Hakata, the city was officially renamed Fukuoka-shi, but at the same time a new train station then being built was named Hakata Station.\nAn imperial decree issued in July 1899 established Hakata as an open port for trade with the United States and the United Kingdom.In 1972, when Fukuoka City was granted designated status by government ordinance, a ward including the old Hakata area was given the name Hakata-ku.\nIn 2016 a large sinkhole appeared in the city center just west of Hakata station. The sinkhole was filled and the affected roads were completely repaired within a few days, in what some called a testament to Japanese ingenuity. However, the hasty repair seems to have been problematic as less than a month later the road began showing signs of imminent implosion.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nHakata was the traditional center for the manufacture of Hakata ningy\u014d, which are traditional Japanese dolls that are famous throughout Japan. Today, almost all Hakata ningy\u014d makers (Hakata ningy\u014d shi) have their factories out of the Old Hakata Area, a part of modern Hakata-ku.\nHakata-ori is a textile used for obis of kimonos.It is also the home of Mentai Rock, named after the popular mentaiko dish served in the region, that spawned numerous J-pop idols during the early 1980s. Neo Mentai Rock is the name given to a recent renewal in activity from local musicians.\nHakata-ben is the local Japanese dialect spoken in the Old Hakata Area.\nHakata is also the location of the pop group HKT48.\nAnouther popular group from Hakata are Kanikapila\nParts of the famous crime novel 'Points and lines' ('Ten to Sen' in Japanese) by the award-winning Japanese writer Seich\u014d Matsumoto occur in Hakata and its train station.\n\n\n=== Famous foods ===\nMentaiko\nTonkotsu (pork bone) ramen, also called simply Hakata ramen\nMotsunabe\nJapanese cheesecake\nMizutaki - Nabemono of chicken\nHakata Torimon (ja:\u535a\u591a\u901a\u308a\u3082\u3093) - a type of cake\nHakata no Hito - a type of cake\nTsukemen (dipping noodles)\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nHakata Dontaku Minato Matsuri - May 3 and 4\nHakata Gion Yamakasa - from July 1 to 15\nHakata O-kunchi - October 23 and 24 (prior to 1953, November 23)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nJR West\nSany\u014d Shinkansen\nHakata Station\nJR Ky\u016bsh\u016b\nKy\u016bsh\u016b Shinkansen\nHakata Station\nKagoshima Main Line\nYoshizuka Station - Hakata Station - Takeshita Station - Minami-Fukuoka Station\nSasaguri Line\nYoshizuka Station\nNishi-Nippon Railroad\nTenjin \u014cmuta Line\nZasshonokuma Station\nFukuoka City Subway\nK\u016bk\u014d Line\nNakasu-Kawabata Station - Gion Station - Hakata Station - Higashi-Hie Station - Fukuokak\u016bk\u014d Station(Fukuoka Airport)\nHakozaki Line\nNakasu-Kawabata Station - Gofukumachi Station - Chiyo-Kench\u014dguchi Station\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nHakata bus terminus (see Nishitetsu)\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nFukuoka Airport\n\n\n=== Harbor ===\nBayside place Hakata Futoh (Hakata Pier)\nCh\u016b\u014d Wharf (Central Wharf) - international ferry Beetle and Kobee and New Camellia\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Commerce ===\nCanal City Hakata\nGrand Hyatt Fukuoka\nHakata Riverain\nHakata-za\nHotel \u014ckura Fukuoka\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nLevel-5 stadium (Hakata no mori Stadium)\nFukuoka Convention Center - Marine Messe Fukuoka, Fukuoka International Congress Center, Fukuoka Kokusai Center\nHakata Civic Center, Hakata Library\nHakata South Library\nNakasu\nRakusui-en\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nShinto\nKushida Shrine\nSumiyoshi Shrine\nT\u014dka Ebisu Shrine\nBuddhism\nSh\u014dfuku Temple\nT\u014dch\u014d Temple\nJ\u014dten Temple\nS\u014dfuku Temple\nChristianity\nFukuoka Korean Christian Church, Chiyo\nHakata New Life Church,\nHikarigaoka (Hill of light) Catholic Church [1]\nMinoshima Catholic Pastoral Center.\nJapan Evangelical Lutheran church, Sasaki machi\nJapan Baptist Church, Aoki\nNorth Kyushu Japanese Orthodox Church, Higashi-hirao\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe South Korean government maintains the Korea Education Institution (Korean: \ud6c4\ucfe0\uc624\uce74 \ud55c\uad6d\uad50\uc721\uc6d0; Japanese: \u798f\u5ca1\u97d3\u56fd\u6559\u80b2\u9662) in Hakata-ku.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "One of the most iconic buildings in Hakata. I loved the water show. It wasn\u2019t as grand as I expect it to be but who am I to complain? It\u2019s free. LOL.

          "Tax free! Famous brands and local initiatives. All varieties that must suit your need. Food court Signage is not that well and cannot find the place. Can easily spend a day and get good stuff.",
          "I'd like to be absolutely clear from the outset: this is a mall, no more or less. There are regular fountain displays (not sure exactly what to call them) where several fountains squirt water in synch with classical music, which is pretty nice, but it's not worth coming for if",
          "There are tons of things to do in Canal City. They have a Jump store and Totoro place as well. There\u2019s a really nice little water area for kids when it\u2019s hot. My 1.5 year old appreciated that the most :)",

          "We have been here before. They have a wonderful light and water show set to music every hour in the Canal. There is a great selection of Japanese items as well as your typical A List Clothing stores. There is a great Arcade and there is a movie theatre. If you are staying",
          "Very big mall that needs many hours if you want to visit the whole place. Arcades, Food, Clothes, Little knickknacks and everything you can ever imagine, or want. Water fountain at the middle of the mall performs every hour or so. Great mall to waste a day away.",
          "Stunning shopping plaza with fantastic show in the evening. I spent 2 hr walking around and sit back for the afternoon coffee. There is nice godzilla show at night.",
          "Many people ask me \"which city is the best in Kyushu area in Japan?\" Canal city in Hakata is the best place for leisure and business. Very convenient place just 20 minutes walking from Hakata station. They have lot of shops and restaurants on the canal. Very romantic atmosphere",
          "Huge shopping area with lots to do for everyone! There is an indoor playground at the top floor and it is awesome for kids! Indoor playground is called Future team lab. After spending the whole afternoon here, we had dinner at Ramen Stadium which is also at the top floor of",

          "Canal city is one of the famous shopping centers in Fukuoka among tourists. In the weekend, around 50% of the customers are tourists mostly from China and South Korea. Here, you can find anything you need. You can find Onitsuka tiger outlet; Laox; sports equipment, shoes,",
          "Nice big shopping center right in between Hakata and Tenjin. On a sunny day it is the perfect place to do some shopping and have a stroll along the riverside. Be prepared to completely lost as I did a number of times and have a wad of cash ready to burn. Just don't go on",
          "Set alongside the East Bank of the Nakagawa River. Surrounded by Hotels of various ratings. Almost all kinds of name brand goods available in speciality stores. Yatai eateries by the river is just in front of the shopping centre on the river. Venture of the bridge into Taijin",
          "Probably been to many mega malls in Japan, find Canal City a bit dated and crowded as we went there during Golden Week weekend. We just went for a walk around, had dinner and went off.",
          "A nice shopping mall with plenty of shops and restaurants. What I liked about this shopping mall was the fountain and laser shows. Gave a bit of entertainment and was fun!",
          "A place for shopping and food under one roof. The one thing that stood out for me was the Moomin Cafe.",

          "Not sure what the fascination with malls is in Japan as they all seem to be the same. This one has a canal and some occasional entertainment. Good choice of restaurants and a happy hour bar.",
          "A very large mall with cinema and great food choices and shops. There is also a nightly fountain show from 7pm.",
          "Interesting fan shape building with indoors & outdoors shops. Nice musical fountains. But If I have only limited time in Fukuoka, I would rather shop at Tenjin or Hakata Station.",
          "This shopping mall is located alongside the canal. It is spread over a number of floors and has a great outdoor area too.",
          "It is a wonderful shopping mall! a lot of shops with reasonable price, and the ramen at top floor is very good! the best thing is the water show, with beautiful water together with good music, make you stay and watch. A good place for photo taking",
          "Standard large shopping mall. Water fountain show at night time. Price is standard, don't expect a very good bargain. Some discount and coupons available for foreign travellers (available at tourist information and tax free help desk)",
          "Canal City had been one of the highlights of our stops in Fukuoka. The free water shows every 30 minutes (including a fully animated One Piece themed show) was a blast to watch - all for free! We had really good Gelato at Vito, cheap cafe latte at MUJI Cafe and enjoyed watching",
          "We were here before (10 years ago), the shops had changed but still can spend hours just browsing around. It is quite big. The problem about this shopping mall is you need to walk about 10min from Hakata station.",
          "Just a big mall with food court and a fancy fountain and light show. Nothing really special. A few Japanese stores but many western stores like Zara, Columbia,H&W. Been there. Done it. Not going back again. Built to target Chinese tourists money.",
          "a medium size of shopping mall,it had a music pool in the middle, a shopping and eat,not some special place",
          "Great to walk around grab some food, play some video games, or just shop. Take in the light show in the evening.",
          "Its nice to come here once and see it for yourself. But there is not much to purchase at a a reasonable price. And the way it is designed, you experince the outdoor weather so it is not that comfortable specially during winter. Going in and out of stores from hot to cold",
          "Shopping paradise, happy to see big sale everywhere. One of the happiest place to be Does not look promising from outside",
          "Many brands e.g. H&M, Bershka, Franc Franc with items on discount. Lovely water display at the canal. However it was a bit too quiet as we went on a weekday.",
          "This is a huge shopping mall with just about every brand you would want to find in Japan. It has both indoor and outdoor connections to the stores on each level so if the weather is nice it is a great way to shop. Super convenient to walk to from Hakata station and a very nice",
          "Amazing fountain night show, you will be immersed in a beautiful symphony of music, light and water powered by advanced lasers and visual projector. I like Muji in the mall, with many food and beverage that are not selling in my country.",
          "Very nice location great with kids. Shopping, Foods, friendly staff, nice weather, and very nice dancing fountain during night time",
          "another mall. plenty of shops for men, women or kids. on floor 5 a nice place to eat ramen. also fine dining and lunch available",
          "I like Uniqlo in the mall,is probably the biggest one than I\u2019ve meet in Hakata or Tenjin,found everything I want in there and is cheaper and tax back. also recommended Mont-belle,we got some cheaper hiking boots and equipments for Camino,it\u2019s huge and staff is nice and willing",
          "It's walkable distance from Hakata or Tenjin, situated on the canal. The water fountain show was great for One piece and less so for other themes that just had music and no projections. There are department stores and local stores here too. Little bit of arcade fun at Taito on",
          "Although Fukuoka is not my favorite city in Japan, I must say that this mall really stood out and impressed me. There are a lot of shopping options ranging from local brands all the way to high end brands (Local and International), lots of department stores that sell a lot of",
          "It is listed as a tourist attraction in Fukuoka! Worth a visit on a rainy day. We managed to keep the kids occupied for 3 hours on a rainy wintery afternoon. A mix of both western brands and Japanese brands.",
          "It feels very festive in the area. It\u2019s only a short walk from my hostel and I wanted to check out the area and Yatai. Just like any other mall in a big city.",
          "You get all kinds of brands here, both local and international. Lots of restaurants as well. I reckon you need about three days if you want to go through the entire mall. There are also intermittent shows at the fountain area.",
          "The usual mall with international and local shops. Nothing unusual with this mall. The restaurants in ramen stadium does not serve good ramen. I have had better ramen at lower prices in other places in fukuoka. Its not a must see when in fukuoka",
          "The restaurants here are OK, the shopping is also OK there's really nothing unique about this mall that every other place may have. The water show is very underwhelming and over hyped. Overall if you were to go to any other mall it'll be just about the same experience.",
          "Nice location close to the canal - hence the name. All the named brand shops are here as well as lots of restaurants and coffee/pastry joints. Hyatt is linked to the shopping complex which has a few zones linked by access bridges on level 2.",
          "This was a maze of shops and stores, but we found our experience here to be enjoyable. Great sales at H & M, and a MASSIVE, fabulous sports store on the third floor. My children enjoyed the game and photo arcade (fourth floor) tremendously - tons of fun. I was happy to find a",
          "the design of this mall is quite interesting - literally a canal city! there's a light show on display too and also a good variety of shops. ramen stadium sells ramen from different parts of japan. one thing i did not like is the tax refund system - its a small place, and very",
          "One thing brought us to this mall: \"Ramen Stadium\"! The \"stadium\" is really just 8 ramen restaurants on floor 5F, but we'd say it's a must-go becuase we never found better ramen anywhere in the city! That was at Jinambo, but there was quite a variety to choose from. Everything",
          "We are not big fan of mall but we we t there to do some shopping and it is a big mall with many floors where you can find whatever you like! We passed on zara h&m and such since you haventhem in europe but muji and taito were good stop! At the ground floor you have a shop that",
          "If you want a 1 stop shop, here you go! Just FYI there are no Nike stores here. Reebok is here instead of Tenjin area and they have a box on the upper level. I didn\u2019t get time to check it out tho. After a quick walk, we went back to Tenjin to shop for the niche stores (United",
          "It is a bit old style but well maintained. The canal n music is nice. A few cafes to offer. Fashion, Zara, H n M, uni Qlo. Most eatery trade after 11am.",
          "Canal City is getting a little older these days since my first visit around 10 years ago. The water show is still great fun, check it out every 30min. But essentially the same shopping as everywhere else in Japanese cities and packed full of tourists. Skip the restaurants as",
          "Located west of Hakata station and way to Tenjin. One of large shopping center in Fukuoka. Has pretty much all the fast fashion brand here. Uniclo, H&M, , such a such. Lot of tourist from Asian country. To me , it is soooo like maze. They have south billing, canter walk, east",
          "This shopping mall is good for shopping all sorts of things and when it gets dark you have to watch the fountain show! Good for pictures! On the 5th floor you have Raumen Stadium with the best raumen you can find!",
          "Its a really big shopping mall. Very clean and many things to buy. Its much cheaper than in singapore. A must visit place when in Hakata.",
          "Canal City Hakata is 300meters away from the Yatai Food Stalls. This modern mall shows dancing fountain and One Piece episodes along with the fountain. The sound system is quite fantastic, too. I was really entertained with the place even I was roaming around solo. This place is",
          "The shopping mall is not that exciting. But the fountain show... Wow. I felt like I was at Universal Studio. Visit this place at night and watch the show. Your mind will be BLOWN.",
          "Good selection of shops. We especially enjoyed the sports shop on the 3rd floor and Ramen Stadium on the 5th.",
          "There is department stores within the nice big structure designed by architect Micheal Graves, plenty of shops around with two hotels occupying this location. Best yet is at the very top level they have the Ramen Butai, which is like a ramen challenge stage where many ramen",
          "but a respite from the heat. Clearly high end retail but I found its layout confusing? We did mooch around. The television wall looked like an interesting installation however, I got the impression a lot of the tvs were broken? They were just dark and this left me wondering",
          "Every time I visit there is always some festivities going on. Not to mention you can try every type of ramen on the top floor. It's amazing. So many shops to visit and the arcade area is really fun.",
          "My husband and I stopped in Fukuoka before heading to Kitakyushu a few months ago. We were suffering from jet lag but had heard there was a Ramen Museum in Canal City (I love a good Ramen!). We walked from our hotel which took about 20 minutes and were pleasantly surprised by",
          "It just like a normal mall around, but noticable in fukuoka area. It has plenty choices of food and store and have a quite nice few to look around. The place is really strategic so if you just want to drop by, it is a good thing to do.",
          "This is a very big shopping mall that you can get nearly anything you want. Have some nice restaurants.",
          "Canal City is a shopping center consist of 4 buildings connected to each other. The buildings have cinema, branded stores, local and western restaurants, hotel and theater as well. It was just walking distance from Hakata Eki-Mae and one small bridge away to Yatai Street. You",
          "Actually just a mall, i would rather choose to go to outlet. The only special thing is the ramen stadium which you can enjoy ramen from different popular ramen shop in japan.",

          "Great place for teens! Beautiful surroundings and friendly staff. Loved walking around and people watching.",
          "Actually canal city is combined with 3 shopping malls. Was a little bit confused when first visit but my sister and I were very enjoy our shopping here. Finally, we went here 3 times and bought a lot of stuff.",
          "My first thought when I visited Canal City was WOW. It's a massive shopping centre with some really awesome architecture. The day I went there was a water show (One Piece) which was really cool to watch. There was also a live concert at the stadium. I ate dinner at ramen",
          "So our hotel is right across from the mall so that why we went there several times. It's a bit confusing in the beginning because there are 6 levels and in four different buildings. But once you get the hang of it.. So the mall has no big brand name like vutton but you can find",
          "All kinds of stores and restaurants including of course McDonald's and Starbucks. Very nice movie theater and Taito Station with great pork ramen. They put a good show on with the fountain quite often.",
          "This is the home of Ramen Stadium, but it is quite large and has a great many shops. They have an outdoor dancing water display (think Las Vegas) that is quite nice at night.",
          "One of the malls i've ever been to with great sights... there are also a live band and a fountain show when i went there... there are also a.lot of stores inside.. more food stalls as well, though there is a ramen museum during the time i was in Fukuoka...",
          "Sprawling over several levels, this shopping complex houses many varied shops and stores, as well as numerous restaurants and food outlets. There are also two cinema complexes in-house. Daily shows in the purpose-built fountain area provide a nice diversion from shopping.",

          "This is a very nice place to visit for families as well as individuals , many shops, stores and restaurants, we have spent quite some time in the area, the main attraction is the night colorful water springs, I do recommend visiting this place",
          "Many ways to reach this place, especially, if the weather is kind, like walking and taking orientation from the bridges that you will cross. By Nakasu Kawabata subway, simply walk along the covered shopping lane till the end, which is a split street. Take the right lane and",
          "A typical large and modern shopping complex in Japan. The building colours are bright and cheerful. The artificial canal runs right through the middle of the complex, creating a lot of open space. If you are keen on ramen, head to the top floor Ramen Stadium, which has many",
          "This place has everything!! The place is HUGE! Get all your shopping done here! There are luxury brands as well as local brands. Some comes with tax free. About 15 minutes walk from the main train station. If you are feeling lazy, there are many buses that come this way.",

          "We went to Canal City because they were having Stadium Ramen where the top 10 ramen were serving their ramen. Stadium Ramen will tour the rest of Japan but we were lucky they were there when we were. We only got to try 2 out of the 10. We liked one of the 10. We didn't have",
          "The good tenant mix can keep a shopper in for hours. Enjoy the water landscaping and the wide range of restaurants and cafes. The fountain animation was engaging and interesting, brings out the child in us. A nice mall if you have at least a couple of hours to spare.",
          "Canal city is located within walking distance from the 2 main stations - Hakata and Tenjin. But I feel this still fell short of those 2 main shopping stations. It's not as crowded on weekdays, and if you're staying nearby, there are more shops outside of the canal city that are",
          "While in Fukuoka there is not allot to do so this is a great spot to visit. It's Japan all the way great scenery and again something a little different",

          "But it is different in that getting around is more confusing than in the normal big box. The fountains are a nice distraction and the architecture is certainly fun.",
          "Mall is huge with separate annexes. There are also plenty of eateries located on the basement too so it's a one stop shop for shoppers. I didn't see much unique selection except for Onitsuka Tigers. There is a only one tax free counter which, to its credit, processes the",

          "We went to have a look around. We ended up eating lunch there, we ate in Ramen stadium at one of the restaurants I think it was Shodaihidechan. We ordered the set a regular ramen, spicy ramen, small gyoza set and two beers for 2000yen. Wasn't too bad the gyoza was way too oily",
          "It is hard to navigate in this facility because of the complex structure, but you have all the shops popular among foreigners here. The Ramen Stadium is great, and One Piece show is fantastic. They are going to have Exile show from next month. Good for frequent users as all",
          "This place is huge yet but personally find it hard to navigate. The place is badly designed as a mall and you have to pass thru indoor and outdoor to get to different shops which is especially annoying during winter when it is freezing outside and warm inside. The only place",

          "This place is a little disjointed but has a lot of nice shops and is a bit of a break from all the huge department stores and is bit more like a mall. Ramen stadium on one of the upper floors is well worth a visit too.",
          "Hakata and Tenjin area generally has a wide range of shopping options. This mall is a good stop for shoppers.",
          "Nice shopping mall where I only bought a crep. It was delicious. But otherwise there is a lot of stores like in Tenjin but I actually liked Canal city better than Tenjin.",
          "Not far from jr hakata station and subway station or even walk from jr hakata city. Can take the bus from jr hakata too. Have plenty of shops ,restaurants: moomin cafe, daiso , theatre., etc . you can enjoy and relax in here all day long. At night there are the special lighting",
          "The mall is big but too big, shops are not well organised. Not much shop provide discount. It is good to go there if you have some target shops here. But I will recommend Tenjin more.",
          "Another neat and clean shopping area, nothing extravaganza but enjoyable nonetheless. Go outside. walk along the river and get into that Japanese traditional shopping strip, undercover and your exercise done for the day.",
          "Nice shopping mall with varieties. H&M, Uniqulo, MUJI, Gap, to name a few. There is ramen stadium which inside the area there are a number of Japanese ramen shop. We tried one and it's good. Besides the ramen stadium, there is also Ichiran (famous ramen shop) in other parts",
          "Seems to be over-rated. Yes, plenty of shops and a thousand over restaurants?? Seems to be your typical mall. The water canal in the mall was closed for renovations!! Grrr... a third for us in our trip! There are lots of shops, so do cater for a whole day if you want to",
          "Although impressive from afar and well located inside the centre of town; when you get up close its hard to get excited about generic, international shopping chains.",
          "This is an attraction described in a local leaflet for visitors. We took the 100 yen bus (circular route) near Tenjin station to this large mall. The routes in the complex are rather complicated and you definitely need a map to find your way to certain shop. A few levels in",
          "Canal city is essentially just a big shopping mall. But there are little treasures hidden within. A little market running down one side where trinkets were being sold. A beautiful open floor with clothing, homewares and a comfortable reading area. And on the very top of it all",
          "The redeeming feature of this otherwise totally generic place was the \"ramen stadium\" where a number of intriguing ships were selling tickets for their particular ramen treats. This was fun!",
          "The mall has a lot of popular brand stores such as H&M, Bershka and Zara. They also have some of the same stores that you'd find in malls such as HEP 105 in Osaka and Shibuya 109 in Tokyo, which caters to younger/trendy. The theater on top does have English movies, but they're a",
          "This station is quite busy and lots of shops and restaurants with varieties. It also have big department stores. It's really a shopping heaven can spend whole day there. One thing good is we got the tax refund right away if we purchased more than 5000 yen. Make sure you check",
          "I am from the Philippines which I consider the mall capital of the world. Some of the largest malls in the world are located the Philippines like Greenbelt, SM Megamall, Mall of Asia, etc. I also been to some of the best and largest malls in the world like the Mall of the",
          "It's quite a big place with a canal spanning through several buildings. Architecturally it might be more interesting but it gets a bit cumbersome for those of us with strollers. Several shops on one floor and off we go to locate the lift again. Did spend a long time at Uniqlo",
          "Surprisingly good food to choose from and plenty of shops to look around. Just beside the Grand Hyatt and very convenient.",
          "There are lots of different shops in canal city. Make sure to get a floor guide as soon as you get there so you can already plot where to go.",
          "It is basically a mall, the only interesting part is that it has a small canal right inside. Shopping wise has all luxury brands and a few Japanese ones too. The size is huge but you can find English maps for the mall easily",
          "The mall was very confusing. What attracted us to the place was the pictures on the Internet, but the place was quite disappointing, not very similar to the picture.",
          "Comfortable shopping center, modern and surrounded internally by nice areas. It has a lot of internation brands' shops and you can do a lot of activities there. Recommended for hot days.",
          "Chance to revisit but only visited the bottom level near the fountains. Good shopping with some small shops with good prices for kids goods, lollies and home wares. Summer sales were on as well as a summer show that closed off a significant part of the fountain area. Some wet",
          "This is a really big shopping centre that has lots and lots of shops. The building is showing its age but is still well maintained. Shops are pretty much the same everywhere. They do have some nice restaurants that I didn't see elsewhere though. And there is a Ramen Stadium",
          "It was rain season when I went here, so going thru the various shops, eateries, etc. while it rained outside was a good way to spend the day. The fourth floor had great Japanese cuisine to try. Got a few cute items to bring back to the States. Even had movie theater inside.",
          "There are a lot of local stores and restaurants to explore. This is definitely not over crowded with tourists, and a good place to get a feel for the real deal.",
          "Nice place and we all enjoyed. Good Japanese and European and American brands. Also surrounded by nice restaurants. Good for a rainy day",
          "Nothing great. Usual shopping experience with variety of shops. Go only when you have time to spare. Over rated and over hyped.",
          "Visited for the poorly named ramen stadium and found a mall with a food court nothing wrong but nothing very special. There is an extensive arcade so probably good for families.",
          "City under city. A must watch thing. You can't imagine where r u. Every thing is there you wish for. Food courts are in numbers. But not for vegetarian people.",
          "Passed through Canal City while walking from our hotel near Hakata Station to Tenjin. It's just a typical huge mall with all the ubiquitous brands you see elsewhere plus some local brands. Nice water feature but really didn't stay long enough to see the fountain show, if there",
          "Canal City celebrates its 20th anniversary this year so for a mall that old it seems a little bit dated and even faded in some areas. Still it's a pleasant place to shop, with so many types of stores under one roof, and a cinema too. Don't miss Ramen Stadium and the newer annex",
          "Usual brands and shops are located at this place such as H&M, Uniqlo etc... There are also some restaurants. We tried Tempura that was very yummy.",
          "This gigantic muti-buildings complex has almost everything a traveller needs. Ramen, sushi, bbq, a la carte, western food, shopping (jillion shops), game centre, ice cream parlour, hotel. Also very close to Hakata station about 10 minute walk.",
          "Variety of high end shops and stalls to choose from. The mall is huge so a little challenging when you navigate the first time. But there are maps for your reference and the concierge can speak English.",
          "A fairly confusing shopping mall with an architecture which reminds one of Las Vegas. Not exactly fascinating...",
          "It is a bog standard shopping mall with some interesting water features, restaurants & a cinema. It doesn't differ from most shopping malls you'd find dotted around Japanese big cities.",
          "This was a very large mall. It was nice browsing the shops although it was mostly foreign brands (H&M, Zara, etc). There are a lot of interesting restaurants (I recommend checking out Moomin Cafe&Bakery) and the Ramen Stadium (on the 6th floor) is also worth visiting as it",
          "Shopping is always part of the itinerary when you go to Fukuoka. This is their main shopping mall. Brands abound and you can get good prices if there's a sale. This is also where the ramen stadium is.",
          "Perhaps it was the time of day but this was disappointing. A collection of ugly buildings housing shops and eateries. It seemed to be lacking atmosphere and certainly pales in comparison to Tenjin as a shopping centre.",
          "Now a days shoppers centers all look similar. This one is no exception. You can find all the major brands here. Lay-out might be a bit confusing though.",
          "Canal city is obviously a very happening place and was an j retesting side of Japan to see. We stopped off in the moomin cafe and gift shop as my family are moomin mad, prices were steep but in a cutesy place like this that is to be expected. You automatically got a giant",
          "Just another mall. Expected more wowzers canals. It's just some water... Makes it rather inconvenient to get around to shops.",
          "This mall has many local and international brands. On the top floor, there is Ramen Stadium, which offers various sorts of ramen noodles. Also, towards the center of the mall, there's a water fountain show, similar to Macau Wynn's and Las Vegas Bellagio. This mall is",
          "It takes less 20 minutes walk from Tenji Station or Hakata Station. And it's more convenient to go by bus. Many foreigners are shopping there especially Korean and Chinese. Shops,cafes,restaurants,theater,cinemas and also hotels are located in the Canal City Hakata. A nice place",
          "The mall houses many local and international brand names. It also has the Ramen Stadium which was a dining experience for us - \"shopping\" for ramen of our liking. If you're not a ramen fan, there are still many other options. We visited this mall mainly for its Ramen",
          "Big outdoor shops, very crowded and noisy but fun to walk around and try different kind of foods. All kind of stores are available in this area, just not enough energy to cover all in one visit.",
          "Great shopping mall for every shoppers! All Fashion stores, kids and teens shops, Souvenir shops and Dining paradise! H&M, Uniqlo, Muji, Beam, Onitsuka Tiger, Gap, Jump shops, JIN, Matsumoto Kiyoshi, Starbucks, Dipper Dan, Moomin Restuarant, Ramen Shops, Game Center, Movies",
          "When Fukuoka is your first stop, this mall will probably impress you. It has literally everything from restaurants to clothing stores and from game arcades to a movie theatre. It's nice to stroll around on a rainy day and the architecture isn't bad. It also has a nice fountain",
          "It was big. You'll find Disney store there and the big Uniqlo store. You see other known brands here. We weren't able to go around that much though",
          "typical japanese mall full of japanese brands and foreign brands of product the center part of the mall has a canal like attraction and we were able to watch some mall shows given it was a sunday restaurants are abundant on the top floor which also serves as a outlook on hakata",
          "I came for ABC Mart. It was a 15 mins walk from hakata station, and I discover another nice shopping paradise for those who are keen to buy international brands and also some Japanese local goods. The shopping mall is a bit dark inside and a bit of renovation. There seems to be",
          "I think the only real problem you'll have shopping in Fukuoka is deciding how much time you have to shop, as the variety of stores is great. We spent a few hours at Canal city wandering and buying a few things here and there once we became orientated with the layout. I would",
          "Walked the canal area and sampled the food and window shop the stores while enjoying the sun and soaking up the culture Love the city",
          "I stayed Hyatt hotel which was located within canal city. Canal city is an amazing place You get all the things you need for a traveller and more. I bought some souvenirs and also ate the best Ramen I ever tried in the 5 floor.",
          "This is a huge mall spread out over 4 buildings. The shops are all designer and restaurants were pricey and looked average.",
          "Many shops including famous brands like Gap, H&M and Uniglo. Beef Taigen restaurant and Ichiran Ramen is conveniently located there too. Cinemas with 4D effects was great when we watched the launch of Star Wars 7 there.",
          "This place has it all. Great location in downtown Fukuoka, beautiful view of the canal, and loads of shops and places to eat. The crapes shop on the ground floor is amazing, they have a ramen \"stadium\" with a bunch of different ramen shops, there is also a movie theater, and",
          "Huge mall split into a few blocks. Many variety of shops and eateries to suit all taste and budgets. Ramen Stadium, with about 10 different types of ramen shops/stalls, is at the 5th storey and there is a nice stretch of open waterway in the middle with a lovely musical fountain",
          "Yes, it's very colorful and structurally \"interesting\". But in all of Fukuoka, Hakata & Tenjin included, the best tax-free shopping was here! Don't know how long it will last though. Ask information for \"tourist-friendly\" stores and eateries, like H&M and Dipper Dan:))) The",
          "Several type of shop. Atmosphere is great. Espicially MUJI for MUJI's fan. Food is great and have several types.",
          "The mall has everything, famous brand store, canal within the outside of mall, with fountain show, many restaurants, movie theater, Oh yes, there is also the Ramen stadium on the fifth floor. Great shopping, musical fountain show, great taste of Hakata Ramen, what more can you",
          "We really didn't expect much when we visited the mall, but given that it's the biggest mall in Fukuoka, it definitely has its own attraction and we did shop a lot! If you are a show lovers, you should know that buying shoes from ABC Mart in Japan is very reasonable. There is a",
          "This shopping place is nice. It actually has a canal flowing through the shopping center. Huge Muji and many many other shops. Easy parking too. Love it!",
          "There are numerous restaurants and shops but most impressive was the ramen stadium. Also there is a good place called bear hug that one can get Japanese style massage. A complete shopping complex for the whole family.",
          "This is the suitable place for find meal on lunch or dinner I'm not sure for breakfast many choice of restaurant you got here and the price really friendly and the store you find such kind like uniqlo, zara, hm n another europe brand but not the luxury one",
          "We walked to the Kushida shrine from Hakata and found the Canal city on our way there. Canal city is a complex of department stores built on two sides of an artificial canal. It looked so muh beautiful in evening time with water music show. I would suggest spending some time",
          "Great shop selection over several floors and lots of food places to eat. Crepes especially good. Easy to access and plenty to keep you busy.",
          "Great place to chill out around the muji coffee place and a Must go place if you like Ramen. You can find all the Famous Ramen at one place , go to the top floor!",
          "The shopping mall has so much to offer. It includes many kinds of stores like clothes, fragrances, suitcases, sports, cinemas, cosmetics, restaurants, animation-related and so on. I believe people who love shopping may spend lots of time here. It took me two hours just to",
          "We walked from Tenjin and took us about twenty minutes. There are lots of shops, with a Cold Stone Creamery at level 2 to let the kids have their ice cream and waffle. Ramen stadium is worth checking out.",
          "This is a good place to shop and eat with wide variety of food. Ramen Stadium, which consists of individual stalls which serve ramen from different regions of Japan can be found here. There are two hotels in here, Grand Hyatt and Washington Hotel, very convenient to get to",
          "Serene city set in a busting pace. Heaps of night life & the atmosphere is very colourful. Easy to get around too.",
          "The world starts to look the same everywhere. This ace is just a shopping mall and nothing that Singapore, Kuala Lumpur et al doesn't have",
          "Canal city is where your u find the best ramen, beef and sushi restaurants. We spent an evening there and was quite impressed with the variety of shops they had there. Even had a men's fashion floor.",
          "It took me around 15 minutes to walk from JR Hakata City to Canal City Hakata, At the entrance of Canal City Hakata, you can see a big Uniqlo. You are recommended to see water + light show under Canal Mirai Christmas Tree 2015 with Micheal Jackson's song at 7pm, 8pm, 9pm and",
          "I was put off by some of the previous reviews. But it was so close to our accommodation that I went anyway. It's a medium priced mall with an excellent selection of shops and easy to navigate. Tax free shopping for visitors. Plenty of restaurants inside and close by.",
          "For those of you, like I was, wondering about staying near Canal City which is a huge shopping mall. I discovered that the South Building of CC and Grand Hyatt is across the river from the red light district. Although I didn't see any ladies standing around since its cold. From",
          "There are lots of food and store here. You can spend almost an afternoon here browsing through the stores and restaurants. The fountain perform water dancing. it's beautiful and worth to see",
          "We stayed at the Grand Hyatt which is attached to the Canal City Hakata mall. It has a nice range of shops and restaurants and we have been spoiled for choice. This is a great option for families, as there's a Disney and Sanrio shop. There are also flagship Uniqlo, H&M and Zara",
          "Light decorations welcome Christmas that attracts shoppers. Some cheap sales going on for all ages. Duty-free pharmaceutical shop mostly Japan-made at b1, really worth the visit so don't forget your passport for rebates.",
          "It is more for the shopping and finding a place of refuge from the cold outside. Food wise is not fantastic. Nevertheless, a good place to hang out at night.",
          "The complex is actually very lovely to walk around, and is split into 5 parts for each cardinal direction and a central walkway. To walk around the shops you are mostly outside, but it is covered so rain isn't much of a problem, but there are a large selection here so that you",
          "Visited Hakata for the ramen. After sticking around the station, I figured the closest place to roam while the rain poured was Canal City. Lots of shops, architecture is kind of dated (except for the newer building which has Uniqlo, which kind of clashes with the old building).",
          "Modern architecture building with shopping mall, restaurant and hotel. This place is packed with several shops from souveniers, home decoration, cloths, restaurants and toys. If you are a fan of either Muji and Gunplas, I would highly recommend this place. The Muji store is so",
          "Nothing spectacular. Has a combination of outdoor and indoor areas, with a host of domestic and international brands, nothing a mall of this size will not carry.",
          "For most westerners it's just another shopping centre with a slightly different feel but food can be found better and cheaper in the many local restaurants and even street found next to the canal.",
          "Nothing more than a shopping mall. It's a modern building with global brand shops, nothing of Japanese flavor. A place you can purchase stuffs, enjoy the fountain show.",
          "There is a big shopping mall in Hakata. However, i found that it's close so early for the shops around 9 pm. and some shop have limited time for tax free (eg. No later than 8 pm) so i have to pay it with tax due to i get back to Hakata late. If you really want to shop. i",
          "Recently I visited Canal City, the first time in 5 years. Just as pretty as ever, all the stores you could ever want to visit, and the staff are friendly and helpful. As a guest house operator in Fukuoka, I recommend all my guests visit Canal City.",
          "A good selection of restaurants in a smart setting. We actually intended to eat at the yattai stands on the island, but they were too busy so we were happy to find this food center",
          "The Gap and Uniglo shops here are one of the larger ones. For example, Uniglo spans three floors in the front block, and there is a Zara opposite as well. On weekends, the place is buzzing and there are usually performances in the water fountain area near the Grand Hyatt",
          "This is an amazing shopping complex, with all brand name stores, food court, a music fountain and a plaza for various performances. The Muji there is especially huge, and is the biggest I have seen in Japan. Its so big they have a space for holding lectures. Must visit.",
          "If you're in to shopping, it's great. I liked going at night, it's all decorated for Halloween (in Oct.) ant there's an hourly lightshow. Very calm, beautiful by the water!",
          "Day 1: Gion As I was not able to get accommodation in Hakata, Gion was the next alternative. It turned out to be not a bad choice at all. Daiwa Roynet, with its decent sized bed and room, was just one stop away from Hakata Station and one-minute walk from Gion Subway. It",
          "Easy to find using the metro and a little walk. Lots of shops, very much market style. Many selling thecsame product. Worth a visit though",
          "If you're looking for something original i don't think this will be the right place, its like any other big shopping mall in the world :) but if you're looking to shop for international products then this is the place",
          "We were staying at the Grand Hyatt and this large mall was connected by a walkway. The stores are spread over several floors and are mainly accessed from outdoor entrances. Since it is brutally hot and humid, in July, just wandering around will make you break a very heavy",
          "It's all under 1 roof and it's a huge place. But there's nothing more that I find interesting there. Food from the ramen stadium is gimmicky and not nice for a city known for its ramen. The nursing room was located in the loo and it is the worst that I have came across in this",
          "Restaurants and tax free stores might be suit for rush tourists but nothing special to see or visit. Most goods are made in China and only few in Japan or suitable as souvenirs.",
          "Nice place, full of restaurants, brand shops. and other attractions. it's close to Hakata Sta, 15mins walking distance and about 25mins to tenjin.",
          "We tried exploring Fukuoka. However, when walked towards the center, we came across Canal City. We entered this strange looking building only to find out that it was very big. There are many shops but what really grabbed our attention was the performances. There was a band",
          "Nice ambience with the canal surrounding the mall. Many shops like Disney Store, Agnes B etc and some local stores. There is a hotel at the mall and many eating places and souvenir shops as well. Good to pay the mall a visit, wide variety of merchandise.",
          "Spent some time wandering around Canal City when we had some time to kill before we could check into our nearby ryokan. Nice shopping center with Japanese and foreign brands, connected to Hyatt Hotel. Go eat at Ramen (Raumen) Stadium of you want to try a variety of ramen from",
          "Great place for shoppers. Has a wide variety of international stores like Zara and H&M as well as local stores. Great food too. Huge place and very clean.",
          "We were walking near the Canal City first day when we arrived Fukuoka. There are a few hotels right below Canal City but we found this mall rather boring. The food hall in the basement was a bit quiet and the shops are mostly chain stores. If you want serious shopping, I'd",
          "Just a 10 minute walk from JR Hakata Station. A great place for shopping, especially the 3rd floor with a great sports selection and range. There's also a section for only-made-in-Japan stuff and another section for all character-based and anime-based merchandise! The 5th",
          "Huge multi-building multi-floor shopping complex connected by a series of pedestrian bridges, featuring fountains and a canal that separates it from Grand Hyatt hotel. Can get confusing for the first time visitor. Plenty of branded shopping (e.g. Bershka, Disney Store, H&M,",
          "Here we can find so many Shops with Branded Stuff and there are Grand Hyatt Hotel in attach to This Shopping Mall. They have Indoor & Outdoor Shops. The Building Divide into 3 part : Grand Building, South & North Building, so it's a big shopping Centre. They also have Musical",
          "Great mall with lots going on. I don't think the canal conept loks old at all, I think it's quite pretty. The fountain show is pretty cool too. Nice place to come in an enjoy AC on a hot summer day. Plus a lot of sales at the stores are enticing too (I like Uniqlo most). But",
          "Lot's of fun, food and shopping. Great shopping arcade with numerous shops and restaurants. The facade is built around a \"canal\" which holds water park/playground and five-story water show. Restaurants on on floor 3 and 4 and offer a wide variety of options. There are U.S.",
          "It was raining whole day when I came. Many shops selling ladies items. Bought a Snoopy lunch time bag (for my spouse). Many tourists too, as it seemed that they were from tour group given free time to explore this City.",
          "Nice place to spend a rainy day (or a sunny day if you are a shoppeholic) Funny fountain show every hour. Good restaurants",
          "Easily reached from Nakasu-Kawabata (leave from exit 5, wander down through the old Kamikawabata Machi market (with some interesting shops), past the Kushida Jinja, and you're then being signposted toward Canal City with a bit of luck. Very scenic for a mall, with water features",
          "I read a lot of reviews about Canal City being dated and boring etc. It's actually a pretty cool place to visit. Yes the whole canal/fountain theme may be a bit old, but the place still has plenty of character. The fountain display is nice and there's a fantastic bar right",
          "The place is near the Hakata bus station and can be quite difficult to find as its facade looks much different from the tourist pamphlets. There are about 5 floors and every floor is crowed with shoppers. The main attraction here is of course the 8 ramen restaurants on the 5th",
          "The layout is interesting enough to make you wander on different levels. Water arrangements make it cooler than the air temperature. It hasn't got the air conditioned environment of a closed in mall so it more eco friendly. Ice sculptures so the kids can cool their hands.",
          "I love this mall. I think the layout is interesting, built on a semicircle facing a hotel, with a little canal between. Twice an hour we can enjoy a water show, and frequent entertainers, often musicians, also comedians, dancers, and general entertainment. We've loved all the",
          "This is a pretty typical shopping mall by the river. It is huge with a major hotel, many restaurants, cafes and departmental stores. On the top floor is a games area and a number of Ramen and noodle restaurants ala ramen street at Tokyo station. The hotel has an oyster",
          "If you're looking for shopping Canal City is for you. Really though it is just like any urban mall. It has a few glitzy features but it's for shopping, not a tourism destination. As a mall it is good, with a wide selection of stores.",
          "We wanted to visit the raumen stadium on the 5th floor of Canal City, which is famous for several ramen stalls. Our two favourites were the Hakata and Sapporo ramen, with the Hakata version using thinner noodles. Both were delicious, and the different broths were complex and",
          "You can do everything in this mall, cinemas, amusement center, good restaurants, numerous shops and theater and Broadway shows. highly recommended.",
          "It's conveniently connected between several buildings that include hotels and shopping malls. They provide hourly water show accompanied by music (not always live) and other shows including acrobats and musicians. From massage to food and shopping, it provides pretty much all",
          "Located next to the Grand Hyatt Hotel, it offers great shopping and dining outlets. The canals also offer a picturesque setting and everything is indoors so you are not exposed to the elements. Many of the outlets open late and you could be spending too much time here without",
          "Big and nice shopping mall. On the top floor there is a ramen stadium with all sorts of ramen stands. On the bottom floor there is a mini Bellagio fountain with music that plays on the hour. All to make your experience here the best",
          "Yes it is just a shopping mall with fountains, but the fountains are very pretty and the whole place lights up with beautiful pink fairy lights at night, great if your hotel is local and you're looking for something to do. The centre itself is huge, with a very diverse",
          "Although it's just a huge shopping complex, there's a variety of shops and eateries--fun place to be if you have free time to spare!",
          "Without knowing how the mall is actually like, tourists may be attracted to Canal City Hakata simply by the word 'canal'. In fact, the so-called 'canals' are little rivers and fountains within a shopping complex and you don't have any chance to go there by boat. Therefore, I",
          "This place has a great variety of shops, resturants and much more. I think it is a little overrated, at the end of the day it is just one big shopping complex, but if thats what you're after I can't deny it has a lot to offer. There was a great Italian place that",
          "A charming mall in a beautiful street. The main attraction is the ramen stadium. if you like ramen, they offer a huge selection of different styles of miso, udon and korean ramen. Most restaurants have English menu. The architectural style of the mall is very interesting, you",
          "A huge shopping mall with artificial canal. Ramen stadium on 5th floor of the canal city was good to have a ramen from different region.",

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub.

It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

          "The ruins of Fukuoka Castle are located in, what is now called, Maizuru Park. Most of the castle was destroyed and is gone now but large portions of the wall are still standing. Given the fastness of the area involved the castle grounds look to have been real big. Although there",
          "Based on reviews and other readings, I expected the castle ruins to be small and unimpressive. When coming here and actually walking around, I found the remains to be the complete opposite. I walked here from Ohori Park, once during the day and again at night. The castle walls",
          "For the most part, all that remains of the castle are walls. There is one turret and one building. It is otherwise a pleasant but unremarkable urban park.",
          "The ruins it selves are not very impressive and large, but nice to visit if you are in the neighbourhood. From the top you have a nice overview over a big part of Fukuoka. For visiting you must climb stairs and a steep hill, so not suitable for wheelchairs.",
          "Its a quiet historical landmark. Didnt see many tourists or locals when I went so its great for taking a leisurely stroll and reading the history of the ruins plastered in several posters in the area. Very easy to DIY. Its has several lookout points so be ready to climb a few",
          "As the other review have said, there isn't much to see but it is cool to walk around. If you make it to the top, you'll get a good view of the city.",

          "This is one of the best places in Fukuoka to see how locals celebrate cherry blossom. It is not only a wonderful view of trees (white and pink) in bloom, but festive atmosphere of picnic and music in the evening. It is free during the day, but in the evening when tree are in",
          "Easy to visit with the subway red/orange line from the citycenter = Tenjin station = K08 to Ohorikoen station = K06; A very pleasant walk in Maizuri park will take you to the castle built in 1601 in 7 years by Kuroda Nagamasa, first lord of Fukuoka province. This castle was",
          "The castle ruins are in the park next to Ohiri Park and are worth a walk through while you are in the neighborhood. There is not much to see, but the view from the top is excellent. Cherry trees fill the property and in cherry blossom season it will be spectacular.",
          "This is a really interesting place of great historical relevance for Fukuoka and Japan. Pity that most of the place is in ruins. You can get a nice 360 degree view of the surrounding area and the walk is pretty. Based on prior posts and noticing all the cherry trees this",
          "It's a shame some castles are destroyed once conquered. I had the castle all to myself on a cool spring day, with cherry blossoms a couple of weeks from reaching full bloom. Could only use my imagination to visualise the vast number of soldiers guarding the massive castle",
          "You could not see much of the Fukuoka Castle but you can see the old walls and some reiun left. The view of the city is great from here.",
          "Getting to the ruins, located in Maizuru Park, requires a long walk up a hill and stairs but the view from the observatory makes it worthwhile. The castle was once a flourishing place 400 years ago but today is mainly the ruins of stone walls, moat and gates. This is a far cry",
          "Parking is easily found near the Fukuoka castle remains. Walk 10 mins to the remains and the gardens around are very interesting. Remains are not much to see however, the parks with less tourists made us very happy to visit.",
          "We do not see what we saw from the photos. the ruins are too small i would say? it is a nice walk around and climb up to the top, you could get good city view",
          "We went on 8 Oct, 2017 and the one turret still intact was hidden behind some scaffolding for renovation. Wish I had known that before hand. The walls are still quite impressive, and the hike up to the top is very reasonable, but with small children it wasn't the most",
          "The castle ruins stand above Maizuru Park. In the park itself is a lovely wooden castle gate. It\u2019s an easy climb up to the top of the castle hill. First there is a sloped ramp with steps. As you get higher up and further along there are a few sets of stairs - some quite new.",
          "This is a great walk around a quiet set of walls steeped in history, and gives you the idea of how vast the city and fortress once was. A visit to the ar conditioned visitor centre is a must before walking around though as signage on the site itself is lacking (in any language!)",
          "We stopped here for a quick walk through with the family while at Ohori Park. It is a nice piece of history to see, especially since it is adjacent to the park. Enjoy!",
          "This used to be the capital and is full of a lot of rich history. The original gate is still available and there is a free museum on the grounds with an archaeological dig site. There is a Rose Garden near by and tons of other activities nearby. Don't forget to say hi to the",
          "Right near Ohori Park - there are only a few stone remnants, but beautiful tranquil grounds, lots of birdlife and flowers.",
          "Set within the Ohori Park and next to the Ohori subway station. It consist of layers of wall, set in a garden atmosphere.",
          "I went in May. Utter waste of time. Just some walls and stairs. View is nothing to shout about. Ohori Park is also boring.",
          "Great to walk around the park full of Cherry Blossum at the tiem we were their with numerous picnics taking place all over the place, The remains provide a great platform to overview the park with its Cherry Trees",
          "It was sad to see these ruins. You can't imagine that such a huge castle compound had to be dismantled because the lord lost a battle and lost everything. It must have been so beautiful in its heyday. There were cherry blossom trees all over the place. Gorgeous.",
          "There is nothing much to see except for some cherry trees along the park. Ohori Park is just next to it. Go only if you have extra time... if not, it can be missed.",
          "Go there not for the remains but for the view of the Ohori Park, and the City. It is beautiful! It is an easy walk to the top with lots of sakura trees but nothing much except for the view at the top. Worth the effort though.",
          "Only one plus - this is only one traditional castle in Fukuoka. Only 2 buildings out if castle are still there. You can take good pictures, but there is nothing special",
          "It is hypothesised back in the day this castle was quite grand and beautiful, but now all that remains is the sloping stone walls that served as a foundation and to lift the Castle above the ground as a form of security. Part of the turrets that made up part of the castle",
          "A lot of walking. Uphill! Nothing to see. Dont expect to see anything but simply where the castle used to stand.",
          "We walked for kilometers under freezing temp just to visit this place. When we got there, all we saw was not just what was left of it, it was also being repaired. To my eye, it wasn't really a castle. But since we were there already, we just snapped some cool photos on top of",
          "When we went to visit, I was hoping to see the images on the pictures. Unfortunately, it was just tons of bricks. Just really remains/ruins as the name implies. The view on the top deck, however, was a fabulous view of Fukuoka. It's a good view to take Panoramics.",
          "It was so cold weather, but really satisfied. good to walk. and the view at the top, it was really amazing. You don't need to go another place to see city view. I recommend go here at Spring.",
          "Large castle ruins, you can walk up to the top for some nice views. Come here after visiting Ohori Park, it is right next to it. Many ruins, castle largely destroyed.",
          "It was quite a sad sight as things were quite run down. It may have been a different scene when the flowers are blooming. Nothing much to see on a winter's day.",
          "Remains of a massive castle and a nice breezy park. If u like history and walking in a park in general. Dont miss it if u go to fukuoka",
          "It was quite a walk from Ohori station, but you will enjoy the long walk. During my visit, I got all the place for myself. I saw a couple, then a after a few minutes, it was only me. I enjoy the view from the top. If I could visit again during spring, I would~",
          "Close to Ohori Koen Subway Station. Very spacious and not so many people around. It is ruins but with the help of remaining parts of the castle and with your imagination, you can feel the atmosphere of the history.",
          "Free place to spend <1 hour. There is an information office you can go to and get an English guide to the castle. It's a nice walk with an excellent view of the city once you get to the ruins of the tower. Essentially a park with the stone wall ruins throughout. It is maybe 4",
          "...and it was tiring for the reason that we set foot on the castle base. Anyhow, even if we felt disappointed after going up a lot of times, we appreciated how Fukuoka looks like from that perspective.",
          "good place in busy city , well worth the walk - its free - if you are in Fukuoka ... its must thing to do",
          "As other reviewers mention, this is mostly the ruins, but the walks are beautiful, the highest observation area offers great views of the area and it's all easy walking paths. A great place to run, unwind, let kids run around to burn off energy and enjoy the multitudes of birds.",
          "The clue to this place is in the name: castle ruins. This is an extensive area with some walls set in a pretty park. There are a few explanatory boards in Japanese and English. Don't expect to see a Japanese castle here; with the exception of one small tower, it is all castle",
          "Go only if you've never been on the grounds of a castle in Japan. You're not going to see anything else except for walls of the ruins of a castle. Only good if you're in need of a running path.",
          "Not much of the castle remains are there. No tourist shops...which was nice. Very, very small caf\u00e9 for a cold drink and snack.",
          "We had a wonderful two hour taxi tour at Fukuoka in Japan. Our driver was a lovely young JapNese lady who spoke English. Only cost about $100 Aussie dollars.....very reasonable",

          "This is a nice park contains the remains of Fukuoka Castle (don't come expecting the actual buildings, which were taken down in the Meiji era). The walking tour isn't advertised very well, but has a very cool virtual reality feature--you get to rent iPads that show you how the",
          "Would recommend to come here. It's very relaxing to walk around the castle ruins and enjoy the beautiful view of Fukuoaka.",
          "Nice historical place to visit. It was free, but not handicapped accessible and the ground was often uneven. The kids enjoyed running and we enjoyed not having to worry about them in a crowd.",
          "This was a great place to walk around even in the rainy season, almost all ruins, except for one little tower and some nice spots to see the city. Beautiful grounds. It must be incredible in cherry blossom season",

          "There's nothing left but the castle walls, and it's not even certain that the turret was ever built, but still this park is well worth a visit. In the midst of this bustling city, even with its wide avenues, it's relaxing and invigorating to spend an hour or two in this historic",
          "Spent the best part of a day wandering the ruins, museum and nearby garden and park. It seems that the ruins of Fukuoka castle are a well kept secret as we almost had the place to ourselves, maybe \"local\" tourists are less interested in the castles that don't sport the",

          "We took the tour offered by Fukuoka Walks. The guide gave the historical background of the site - the Castle and how it was built in the olden times and how it was discovered just a few decades back. We then realized how deep and intense the history of Japan is, thus,",
          "The castle ruins themselves aren't much of a sight, however the area itself allows for a nice view around Fukuoka and from the top of the remains you can see Ohori Park too. We went during Sakura season, which was very pretty, I would recommend this as a place to visit at this",
          "Still mostly ruins with a few bits have been renovated but still worth checking out. Set in a pretty area with some blossom trees and has a good view of the city.",

          "Not much of the castle left but the views from the top of the castle were exquisite and perfect for getting photos. Entry is free and as I was in the car I can't say much about getting there using public transport. A great way to spend an hour or two!",
          "Quite refreshing if you visit the REmains in the morning. Not much to see. However, if you have a local travel guide, you could have more understanding of the City history. I do have such a guide who could tell us more about the Remains. Otherwise, have some review of guide book",

It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

In the ensuing skirmishes, the shrine was burned to the ground. When the shrine was reconstructed, a calligraphy Tekikoku k\u014dfuku (\u6575\u56fd\u964d\u4f0f; surrender of the enemy nation) was put on the tower gate.  The calligraphy was written by Emperor Daigo, dedicated by Emperor Daijo Kameyama as a supplication to Hachiman to defeat invaders.\nThe shrine is highly ranked among the many shrines in Japan. It was listed in Engishiki-jinmy\u014dch\u014d (\u5ef6\u559c\u5f0f\u795e\u540d\u5e33) edited in 927. In 11th or 12th century, the shrine was ranked as Ichinomiya (\u4e00\u5bae; first shrine) of Chikuzen Province.\nAdmiral Heihachiro Togo, famous for defeating Russia on the seas, was known to worship often at Hakozaki shrine.\nFrom 1871-1946, Hakozaki was officially designated a Kanpei-taisha (\u5b98\u5e63\u5927\u793e), in the first rank of government supported shrines. Other similar Hachiman shrines were Iwashimizu Hachimang\u016b of Yawata in Kyoto Prefecture and Usa Shrine of Usa in \u014cita Prefecture.\n\n\n== Shinto belief ==\nHakozaki Shrine is dedicated to the veneration of the kami Hachiman.  This shrine especially venerates the memory of Emperor \u014cjin, Empress Jing\u016b and Tamayori-bime.\n\n\n== Treasures ==\nA number of structures in the shrine complex have been designated as important cultural assets of Japan, including the main hall, the worship hall, tower gate and the main Torii, Ichino-torii.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nThe annual Tamaseseri Festival (January 3) and the Hojoya Festival (September 12\u201318) attract many visitors to the shrine.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Shinto shrines\nJapanese mythology\nUgayafukiaezu\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Japanese) Hakozaki Shrine website\n(in Japanese) Fukuoka/Hakata Tourist Information website, Hakozaki Shrine, images + video",

        "wiki": "Hakata Gion Yamakasa (\u535a\u591a\u7947\u5712\u5c71\u7b20) is a Japanese festival celebrated from the 1st until the 15th of July in Hakata, Fukuoka. The festivities are centered on the Kushida Jinja. The festival is famous for the Kakiyama, that weigh around one ton and are carried around the city as an act of float-racing. The festival is believed to be over 770 years old and attracts up to a million spectators each year. It was designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property of Japan in 1979. The sound of the Yamakasa has also been selected by the Ministry of the Environment as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan.\n\n\n== The Floats ==\nThe floats, called Yamakasa, are divided into two groups. The Kakiyama are the smaller, carryable floats, that are raced through the town, while the Kazariyama are stationary floats, that are built up to 13 metres high and often depict historic or mythical events of Japanese culture.\nOriginally the Kakiyama and Kazariyama were one and the same, with the large floats being carried through the city. However the Yamakasa were split up in 1898 when the electrical power lines in Hakata became too common for large Yamakasa to be carried through the streets.\n\n\n== Hakata districts ==\nHakata, once its own city, merged with Fukuoka in 1876. The festivities are mostly based in Hakata.\nHakata was divided into seven districts by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1586/1587. Some of these districts have changed names and exact boundaries multiple times; they still see themselves as the original seven districts. Soon after the division, carrying the Yamakasa through one's own district became a competition for speed. Today, the main event, the Oiyama, is a race between the districts.\nThe districts are Higashi-nagare, Nakasu-nagare, Nishi-nagare, Chiyo-nagare, Ebisu-nagare, Doi-nagare and Daikoku-nagare.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMatsuri\nGion Matsuri\nList of Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties\nImportant Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan\n100 Soundscapes of Japan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Japanese) Hakata Gion Yamakasa homepage\n(in English) Hakata-Gion-Yamakasa Portal Site: Yamakasa-Navi\nHakata Gion Yamakasa NHK",

        "wiki": "Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or simply Krung Thep. The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has a population of over eight million, 12.6 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.The Asian investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its red-light districts. The Grand Palace and Buddhist temples including Wat Arun and Wat Pho stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of Khaosan Road and Patpong. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive expressway network, together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, under the rule of Ayutthaya. Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of a siege in 1688 in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese Empire in 1767, the newly crowned King Taksin established his capital at the town, which became the base of the Thonburi Kingdom. In 1782, King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's Rattanakosin Island, thus founding the Rattanakosin Kingdom. The City Pillar was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.Bangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings Mongkut (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and Chulalongkorn (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country abolished absolute monarchy in 1932.\n\nAs Thailand allied with Japan in World War II, Bangkok was subjected to Allied bombing, but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of US aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as a US military R&R destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8 million to 3 million in the 1960s.\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok. Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in 1973 and 1976, anti-military demonstrations in 1992, and successive anti-government demonstrations by opposing groups from 2008 on.\nAdministration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of Monthon Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23) as a national subdivision. In 1915, the monthon was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe origin of the name Bangkok (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01, pronounced in Thai as [b\u0101\u02d0\u014b k\u0254\u0300\u02d0k] (listen)), is unclear. Bang is a Thai word meaning 'a village on a stream', and the name might have been derived from Bang Ko (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30), ko meaning 'island', stemming from the city's watery landscape. Another theory suggests that it is shortened from Bang Makok (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e21\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01), makok being the name of Elaeocarpus hygrophilus, a plant bearing olive-like fruit. This is supported by the former name of Wat Arun, a historic temple in the area, that used to be called Wat Makok.Officially, the town was known as Thonburi Si Mahasamut (\u0e18\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e17\u0e23, from Pali and Sanskrit, literally 'city of treasures gracing the ocean') or Thonburi, according to the Ayutthaya Chronicles. Bangkok was likely a colloquial name, albeit one widely adopted by foreign visitors, who continued to use it to refer to the city even after the new capital's establishment.\nWhen King Rama I established his new capital on the river's eastern bank, the city inherited Ayutthaya's ceremonial name, of which there were many variants, including Krung Thep Thawarawadi Si Ayutthaya (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e27\u0e32\u0e23\u0e27\u0e14\u0e35\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e38\u0e18\u0e22\u0e32) and Krung Thep Maha Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e38\u0e18\u0e22\u0e32). Edmund Roberts, visiting the city as envoy of the United States in 1833, noted that the city, since becoming capital, was known as Sia-Yut'hia, and this is the name used in international treaties of the period.Today, the city is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23) or simply Krung Thep (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e2f), a shortening of the ceremonial name which came into use during the reign of King Mongkut. The full name reads as follows:\nKrungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanakosin Mahintharayutthaya Mahadilokphop Noppharatratchathaniburirom Udomratchaniwetmahasathan Amonphimanawatansathit Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 \u0e2d\u0e21\u0e23\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e42\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e38\u0e18\u0e22\u0e32 \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e34\u0e25\u0e01\u0e20\u0e1e \u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e1a\u0e39\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e21\u0e22\u0e4c \u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e2d\u0e21\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e15\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e2a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e30\u0e17\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e22\u0e27\u0e34\u0e29\u0e13\u0e38\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c\nThe name, composed of Pali and Sanskrit root words, translates as:\n\nCity of angels, great city of immortals, magnificent city of the nine gems, seat of the king, city of royal palaces, home of gods incarnate, erected by Vishvakarman at Indra's behest.\nThe name is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's longest place name, at 168 letters. Thai school children are taught the full name, although few can explain its meaning as many of the words are archaic, and known to few. Many Thais who recall the full name do so because of its use in the 1989 song \"Krung Thep Maha Nakhon\" by Thai rock band Asanee\u2013Wasan, the lyrics of which consist entirely of the city's full name, repeated throughout the song.\nThe city is now officially known in Thai by a shortened form of the full ceremonial name, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, which is colloquially further shortened to Krung Thep. (Krung is a Thai word of Khmer origin, meaning 'capital', while thep is from Pali/Sanskrit, meaning 'deity' or 'god' and corresponding to deva.) Bangkok is the city's official English name, as reflected in the name of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe city of Bangkok is locally governed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). Although its boundaries are at the provincial (changwat) level, unlike the other 76 provinces Bangkok is a special administrative area whose governor is directly elected to serve a four-year term. The governor, together with four appointed deputies, form the executive body, who implement policies through the BMA civil service headed by the Permanent Secretary for the BMA. In separate elections, each district elects one or more city councillors, who form the Bangkok Metropolitan Council. The council is the BMA's legislative body, and has power over municipal ordinances and the city's budget. However, after the coup of 2014 all local elections have been cancelled and the council was appointed by the government on 15 September 2014. The current Bangkok Governor is Police General Aswin Kwanmuang, who was appointed by the military government on 26 October 2016 following the suspension of the last elected governor M.R. Sukhumbhand Paribatra.\nBangkok is divided into fifty districts (khet, equivalent to amphoe in the other provinces), which are further subdivided into 180 sub-districts (khwaeng, equivalent to tambon). Each district is managed by a district director appointed by the governor. District councils, elected to four-year terms, serve as advisory bodies to their respective district directors.\nThe BMA is divided into sixteen departments, each overseeing different aspects of the administration's responsibilities. Most of these responsibilities concern the city's infrastructure, and include city planning, building control, transportation, drainage, waste management and city beautification, as well as education, medical and rescue services. Many of these services are provided jointly with other agencies. The BMA has the authority to implement local ordinances, although civil law enforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police Bureau.\n\nThe seal of the city shows Hindu god Indra riding in the clouds on Airavata, a divine white elephant known in Thai as Erawan. In his hand Indra holds his weapon, the vajra. The seal is based on a painting done by Prince Naris. The tree symbol of Bangkok is Ficus benjamina. The official city slogan, adopted in 2012, reads: As built by deities, the administrative center, dazzling palaces and temples, the capital of Thailand \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e2f \u0e14\u0e38\u0e08\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e28\u0e39\u0e19\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\nAs the capital of Thailand, Bangkok is the seat of all branches of the national government. The Government House, Parliament House and Supreme, Administrative and Constitutional Courts are all in the city. Bangkok is the site of the Grand Palace and Dusit Palace, respectively the official and de facto residence of the king. Most government ministries also have headquarters and offices in the capital.\n\n\n=== Calls to move the capital ===\nBangkok is faced with multiple problems\u2014including congestion (see (\u00a7 Transport below), and especially subsidence and flooding (see \u00a7 Geography)\u2014which have raised the issue of moving the nation's capital elsewhere. The idea is not new: during World War II Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram planned unsuccessfully to relocate the capital to Phetchabun. In the 2000s, the Thaksin Shinawatra administration assigned the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) to formulate a plan to move the capital to Nakhon Nayok Province. The 2011 floods revived the idea of moving government functions from Bangkok. In 2017, the military government assigned NESDC to study the possibility of moving government offices from Bangkok to Chachoengsao Province in the east.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBangkok city proper covers an area of 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi), ranking 69th among the other 76 provinces of Thailand. Of this, about 700 square kilometres (270 sq mi) form the built-up urban area. It is ranked 73rd in the world in terms of land area. The city's urban sprawl reaches into parts of the six other provinces it borders, namely, in clockwise order from northwest: Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Chachoengsao, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, and Nakhon Pathom. With the exception of Chachoengsao, these provinces, together with Bangkok, form the greater Bangkok Metropolitan Region.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nBangkok is in the Chao Phraya River delta in Thailand's central plain. The river meanders through the city in a southerly direction, emptying into the Gulf of Thailand approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) south of city centre. The area is flat and low-lying, with an average elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level. Most of the area was originally swampland, which was gradually drained and irrigated for agriculture by the construction of canals (khlong) which took place from the 16th to 19th centuries. The course of the river as it flows through Bangkok has been modified by the construction of several shortcut canals.\n\nThe city's waterway network served as the primary means of transport until the late 19th century, when modern roads began to be built. Up until then, most people lived near or on the water, leading the city to be known during the 19th century as the \"Venice of the East\". Many of these canals have since been filled in or paved over, but others still criss-cross the city, serving as major drainage channels and transport routes. Most canals are now badly polluted, although the BMA has committed to the treatment and cleaning up of several canals.The geology of the Bangkok area is characterized by a top layer of soft marine clay, known as \"Bangkok clay\", averaging 15 metres (49 ft) in thickness, which overlies an aquifer system consisting of eight known units. This feature has contributed to the effects of subsidence caused by extensive ground water pumping. First recognized in the 1970s, subsidence soon became a critical issue, reaching a rate of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) per year in 1981. Ground water management and mitigation measures have since lessened the severity of the situation, although subsidence is still occurring at a rate of 10 to 30 millimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) per year, and parts of the city are now 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) below sea level. There are fears that the city may be submerged by 2030. A study published in October 2019 in Nature Communications corrected earlier models of coastal elevations and concluded that up to 12 million Thais\u2014mostly in the greater Bangkok metropolitan area\u2014face the prospect of annual flooding events.Subsidence has resulted in increased flood risk, as Bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low elevation and an inadequate drainage infrastructure. The city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and building drain tunnels, but parts of Bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly inundated. Heavy downpours resulting in urban runoff overwhelming drainage systems, and runoff discharge from upstream areas, are major triggering factors. Severe flooding affecting much of the city occurred in 1995 and 2011. In 2011, most of Bangkok's northern, eastern and western districts were flooded, in some places for over two months. Coastal erosion is also an issue in the gulf coastal area, a small length of which lies within Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian District. Global warming poses further serious risks, and a study by the OECD has estimated that 5.138 million people in Bangkok may be exposed to coastal flooding by 2070, the seventh highest figure among the world's port cities.There are no mountains in Bangkok. The closest mountain range is the Khao Khiao Massif, about 40 km (25 mi) southeast of the city. Phu Khao Thong, the only hill in the metropolitan area, originated with a very large chedi that King Rama III (1787\u20131851) built at Wat Saket. The chedi collapsed during construction because the soft soil could not support its weight. Over the next few decades, the abandoned mud-and-brick structure acquired the shape of a natural hill and became overgrown with weeds. The locals called it phu khao (\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32), as if it were a natural feature. In the 1940s, enclosing concrete walls were added to stop the hill from eroding.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Thailand, Bangkok has a tropical savanna climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification and is under the influence of the South Asian monsoon system. It experiences three seasons: hot, rainy, and cool, although temperatures are fairly hot year-round, ranging from an average low of 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F) in December to an average high of 35.4 \u00b0C (95.7 \u00b0F) in April. The rainy season begins with the arrival of the southwest monsoon around mid-May. September is the wettest month, with an average rainfall of 334.3 millimetres (13.16 in). The rainy season lasts until October, when the dry and cool northeast monsoon takes over until February. The hot season is generally dry, but also sees occasional summer storms. The surface magnitude of Bangkok's urban heat island has been measured at 2.5 \u00b0C (4.5 \u00b0F) during the day and 8.0 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) at night. The highest recorded temperature of Bangkok metropolis was 40.1 \u00b0C (104.2 \u00b0F) in March 2013, and the lowest recorded temperature was 9.9 \u00b0C (49.8 \u00b0F) in January 1955.The Climate Impact Group at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies analyzed climate data for major cities worldwide. It found that Bangkok in 1960 had 193 days at or above 32 \u00b0C. In 2018, Bangkok can expect 276 days at or above 32 \u00b0C. The group forecasts a rise by 2100 to, on average, 297 to 344 days at or above 32 \u00b0C.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nBangkok's fifty districts serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the BMA. Thirty-five of these districts lie to the east of the Chao Phraya, while fifteen are on the western bank, known as the Thonburi side of the city. The fifty districts, arranged by district code, are:\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nBangkok's districts often do not accurately represent the functional divisions of its neighbourhoods or land usage. Although urban planning policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as ribbon developments extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas. The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of Nonthaburi, Pak Kret, Rangsit and Samut Prakan are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry, and government. The BMA's City Planning Department (CPD) is responsible for planning and shaping further development. It published master plan updates in 1999 and 2006, and a third revision is undergoing public hearings in 2012.\n\nBangkok's historic centre remains the Rattanakosin Island in Phra Nakhon District. It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new Dusit Palace. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, as well as the Royal Plaza and Ratchadamnoen Avenue which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the Democracy Monument. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on Si Lom and Sathon Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's red-light districts. The Siam and Ratchaprasong areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in Southeast Asia. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along Sukhumvit Road leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially Asok Montri, while upmarket housing is found in many of its sois ('alley' or 'lane').\nBangkok lacks a single distinct central business district. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as Siam Station, the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines. The Victory Monument in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, Phahonyothin and Ratchawithi / Din Daeng Roads respectively run north and east linking to major residential areas. Most of the high-density development areas are within the 113-square-kilometre (44 sq mi) area encircled by the Ratchadaphisek inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular shophouses, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles. There are 581 skyscrapers over 90 metres (300 feet) tall in the city. Bangkok was ranked as the world's eighth tallest city in 2016. As a result of persistent economic disparity, many slums have emerged in the city. In 2000 there were over one million people living in about 800 slum settlements. Many slums are concentrated near the Bangkok Port in Khlong Toei District.\n\n\n=== Parks and green zones ===\n\nBangkok has several parks, although these amount to a per capita total park area of only 1.82 square metres (19.6 sq ft) in the city proper. Total green space for the entire city is moderate, at 11.8 square metres (127 sq ft) per person. In the more densely built-up areas of the city these numbers are as low as 1.73 and 0.72 square metres (18.6 and 7.8 sq ft) per person. More recent numbers claim that there is 3.3 m2 of green space per person, compared to an average of 39 m2 in other cities across Asia. In Europe, London has 33.4 m2 of green space per head. Bangkokians thus have 10 times less green space than is standard in the region's urban areas. Green belt areas include about 700 square kilometres (270 sq mi) of rice paddies and orchards on the eastern and western edges of the city, although their primary purpose is to serve as flood detention basins rather than to limit urban expansion. Bang Kachao, a 20-square-kilometre (7.7 sq mi) conservation area on an oxbow of the Chao Phraya, lies just across the southern riverbank districts, in Samut Prakan Province. A master development plan has been proposed to increase total park area to 4 square metres (43 sq ft) per person.Bangkok's largest parks include the centrally located Lumphini Park near the Si Lom \u2013 Sathon business district with an area of 57.6 hectares (142 acres), the 80-hectare (200-acre) Suanluang Rama IX in the east of the city, and the Chatuchak\u2013Queen Sirikit\u2013Wachirabenchathat park complex in northern Bangkok, which has a combined area of 92 hectares (230 acres).\n\n\n== Demography ==\nThe city of Bangkok has a population of 8,305,218 according to the 2010 census, or 12.6 percent of the national population. In 2018, the population has been estimated to be about 10 million. Roughly half are internal migrants from other Thai provinces. Only 5,692,284 residents, belonging to 2,672,423 households, registered Bangkok as their legal domicile, according to 2014 statistics. Much of Bangkok's daytime population commutes from surrounding provinces in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, the total population of which is 14,626,225. Bangkok is a cosmopolitan city; the census showed that it is home to 567,120 expatriates from Asian countries (including 71,024 Chinese and 63,069 Japanese nationals), 88,177 from Europe, 32,241 from the Americas, 5,856 from Oceania and 5,758 from Africa. Migrants from neighbouring countries include 216,528 Burmese, 72,934 Cambodians and 52,498 Lao. In 2018, numbers show that there are 370,000 international migrants registered with the Department of Employment, more than half of them migrants from Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.Although it has been Thailand's largest population centre since its establishment as capital city in 1782, Bangkok grew only slightly throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. British diplomat John Crawfurd, visiting in 1822, estimated its population at no more than 50,000. As a result of Western medicine brought by missionaries as well as increased immigration from both within Siam and overseas, Bangkok's population gradually increased as the city modernized in the late 19th century. This growth became even more pronounced in the 1930s, following the discovery of antibiotics. Although family planning and birth control were introduced in the 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated. Only in the 1990s have Bangkok's population growth rates decreased, following the national rate. Thailand had long since become highly centralized around the capital. In 1980, Bangkok's population was fifty-one times that of Hat Yai and Songkhla, the second-largest urban centre, making it the world's most prominent primate city.\n\nThe majority of Bangkok's population identify as Thai, although details on the city's ethnic make-up are unavailable, as the national census does not document race. Bangkok's cultural pluralism dates back to the early days of its founding: several ethnic communities were formed by immigrants and forced settlers including the Central Thai (include Tavoyan), Khmer, Lao, Vietnamese, Mon and Malay. Most prominent were the Chinese, who played major roles in the city's trade and became the majority of Bangkok's population\u2014estimates include up to three-fourths in 1828 and almost half in the 1950s. Chinese immigration was restricted from the 1930s and effectively ceased after the Chinese Revolution in 1949. Their prominence subsequently declined as younger generations of Thai Chinese integrated and adopted a Thai identity. Bangkok is still nevertheless home to a large Chinese community, with the greatest concentration in Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown.\n\nThe majority (91 percent) of the city's population is Buddhist. Other religions include Islam (4.7 percent), Christianity (2 percent), Hinduism (0.5 percent), Sikhism (0.1 percent) and Confucianism (0.1 percent).Apart from Yaowarat, Bangkok also has several other distinct ethnic neighbourhoods. The Indian community is centred in Phahurat, where the Gurdwara Siri Guru Singh Sabha, founded in 1933, is located. Ban Khrua on Saen Saep Canal is home to descendants of the Cham who settled in the late 18th century. Although the Portuguese who settled during the Thonburi period have ceased to exist as a distinct community, their past is reflected in Santa Cruz Church, on the west bank of the river. Likewise, Assumption Cathedral on Charoen Krung Road is among many European-style buildings in the Old Farang Quarter, where European diplomats and merchants lived in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Nearby, the Haroon Mosque is the centre of a Muslim community. Newer expatriate communities exist along Sukhumvit Road, including the Japanese community near Soi Phrom Phong and Soi Thong Lo, and the Arab and North African neighbourhood along Soi Nana. Sukhumvit Plaza, a mall on Soi Sukhumvit 12, is popularly known as Korea Town.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBangkok is the economic centre of Thailand, and the heart of the country's investment and development. In 2010, the city had an economic output of 3.142 trillion baht (US$98.34 billion), contributing 29.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This amounted to a per-capita GDP value of 456,911 baht ($14,301), almost three times the national average of 160,556 baht ($5,025). The Bangkok Metropolitan Region had a combined output of 4.773 trillion baht ($149.39 billion), or 44.2 percent of GDP. Bangkok's economy ranks as the sixth among Asian cities in terms of per-capita GDP, after Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka\u2013Kobe and Seoul.Wholesale and retail trade is the largest sector in the city's economy, contributing 24 percent of Bangkok's gross provincial product. It is followed by manufacturing (14.3 percent); real estate, renting and business activities (12.4 percent); transport and communications (11.6 percent); and financial intermediation (11.1 percent). Bangkok alone accounts for 48.4 percent of Thailand's service sector, which in turn constitutes 49 percent of GDP. When the Bangkok Metropolitan Region is considered, manufacturing is the most significant contributor at 28.2 percent of the gross regional product, reflecting the density of industry in the Bangkok's neighbouring provinces. The automotive industry based around Greater Bangkok is the largest production hub in Southeast Asia. Tourism is also a significant contributor to Bangkok's economy, generating 427.5 billion baht ($13.38 billion) in revenue in 2010.\n\nThe Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is on Ratchadaphisek Road in inner Bangkok. The SET, together with the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI) has 648 listed companies as of the end of 2011, with a combined market capitalization of 8.485 trillion baht ($267.64 billion). Due to the large amount of foreign representation, Thailand has for several years been a mainstay of the Southeast Asian economy and a centre of Asian business. The Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranks Bangkok as an \"Alpha\" world city, and it is ranked 59th in Z/Yen's Global Financial Centres Index 11.Bangkok is home to the headquarters of all of Thailand's major commercial banks and financial institutions, as well as the country's largest companies. Many multinational corporations base their regional headquarters in Bangkok due to the lower cost of labour and operations relative to other major Asian business centres. Seventeen Thai companies are listed on the Forbes 2000, all of which are based in the capital, including PTT, the only Fortune Global 500 company in Thailand.Income inequality is a major issue in Bangkok, especially between relatively unskilled lower-income immigrants from rural provinces and neighbouring countries, and middle-class professionals and business elites. Although absolute poverty rates are low\u2014only 0.64 percent of Bangkok's registered residents were living under the poverty line in 2010, compared to a national average of 7.75 percent\u2014economic disparity is still substantial. The city has a Gini coefficient of 0.48, indicating a high level of inequality.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBangkok is one of the world's top tourist destinations. Of 162 cities worldwide, MasterCard ranked Bangkok as the top destination city by international visitor arrivals in its Global Destination Cities Index 2018, ahead of London, with just over 20 million overnight visitors in 2017. This was a repeat of its 2017 ranking (for 2016). Euromonitor International ranked Bangkok fourth in its Top City Destinations Ranking for 2016. Bangkok was also named \"World's Best City\" by Travel + Leisure magazine's survey of its readers for four consecutive years, from 2010 to 2013.\nAs the main gateway through which visitors arrive in Thailand, Bangkok is visited by the majority of international tourists to the country. Domestic tourism is also prominent. The Department of Tourism recorded 26,861,095 Thai and 11,361,808 foreign visitors to Bangkok in 2010. Lodgings were made by 15,031,244 guests, who occupied 49.9 percent of the city's 86,687 hotel rooms. Bangkok also topped the list as the world's most popular tourist destinations in 2017 rankings.Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions and city life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's sex tourism scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.\n\nAmong Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples, including Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun. The Giant Swing and Erawan Shrine demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. Vimanmek Mansion in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the Jim Thompson House provides an example of traditional Thai architecture. Other major museums include the Bangkok National Museum and the Royal Barge National Museum. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.Shopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling Chatuchak Weekend Market. Taling Chan Floating Market is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. Khao San Road has long been famous as a destination for backpacker tourism, with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world.\nBangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although prostitution is technically illegal and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname \"Sin City of Asia\" for its level of sex tourism.Issues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing. In a survey of 616 tourists visiting Thailand, 7.79 percent reported encountering a scam, the most common of which was the gem scam, in which tourists are tricked into buying overpriced jewellery.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Bangkok reflects its position as Thailand's centre of wealth and modernisation. The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. Conspicuous consumption serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts. Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of street vendors selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.In 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the National Council for Peace and Order (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including Khlong Thom, Saphan Lek, and the flower market at Pak Khlong Talat. Nearly 15,000 vendors were evicted from 39 public areas in 2016. While some applauded the efforts to focus on pedestrian rights, others have expressed concern that gentrification would lead to the loss of the city's character and adverse changes to people's way of life.\n\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\n\nThe residents of Bangkok celebrate many of Thailand's annual festivals. During Songkran on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. Loi Krathong, usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of CentralWorld. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the Royal Guards' parade.\nSanam Luang is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the Royal Ploughing Ceremony which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The Chinese New Year (January\u2013February) and Vegetarian Festival (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nBangkok is the centre of Thailand's media industry. All national newspapers, broadcast media and major publishers are based in the capital. Its 21 national newspapers had a combined daily circulation of about two million in 2002. These include the mass-oriented Thai Rath, Khao Sod and Daily News, the first of which currently prints a million copies per day, as well as the less sensational Matichon and Krungthep Thurakij. The Bangkok Post and The Nation are the two national English language dailies. Foreign publications including The Asian Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Straits Times and the Yomiuri Shimbun also have operations in Bangkok. The large majority of Thailand's more than 200 magazines are published in the capital, and include news magazines as well as lifestyle, entertainment, gossip and fashion-related publications.\nBangkok is also the hub of Thailand's broadcast television. All six national terrestrial channels, Channels 3, 5 and 7, Modernine, NBT and Thai PBS, have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite channels based in Bangkok. TrueVisions is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002. Broadcast media reform stipulated by the 1997 Constitution has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the Thai film industry since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of cinemas and multiplexes, and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the Bangkok International Film Festival and the World Film Festival of Bangkok.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTraditional Thai art, long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the Department of Fine Arts' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of khon masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The National Gallery hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's contemporary art scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the Patravadi Theatre and H Gallery. The centrally located Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city. There are also many other art galleries and museums, including the privately owned Museum of Contemporary Art.\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays. Khon and other traditional dances are regularly performed at the National Theatre and Salachalermkrung Royal Theatre, while the Thailand Cultural Centre is a newer multi-purpose venue which also hosts musicals, orchestras and other events. Numerous venues regularly feature a variety of performances throughout the city.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAs is the national trend, association football and Muay Thai dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene. Muangthong United, Bangkok United, Port and Police Tero are major Thai League clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, while the Rajadamnern and Lumpini stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\nWhile sepak takraw can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm. Western sports introduced during the reign of King Chulalongkorn were originally only available to the privileged, and such status is still associated with certain sports. Golf is popular among the upwardly mobile, and there are several courses in Bangkok. Horse racing, highly popular at the mid-20th century, still takes place at the Royal Bangkok Sports Club.\nThere are many public sporting facilities located throughout Bangkok. The two main centres are the National Stadium complex, which dates to 1938, and the newer Hua Mak Sports Complex, which was built for the 1998 Asian Games. Bangkok had also hosted the games in 1966, 1970 and 1978; the most of any city. The city was the host of the inaugural Southeast Asian Games in 1959, the 2007 Summer Universiade and the 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAlthough Bangkok's canals historically served as a major mode of transport, they have long since been surpassed in importance by land traffic. Charoen Krung Road, the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated expressway network helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and trams served the city from 1888 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first rapid transit system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and boat services which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"tuk-tuk\" auto rickshaws.\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the national highway and rail networks, as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (soi) which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and motorway routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles. These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s. The extent of the problem is such that the Thai Traffic Police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time. While Bangkok's limited road surface area (8 percent, compared to 20\u201330 percent in most Western cities) is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams, other factors, including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level, inadequate public transport systems, and lack of transportation demand management, also play a role. Efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways, as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems. The city's overall traffic conditions, however, remain poor.\nTraffic has been the main source of air pollution in Bangkok, which reached serious levels in the 1990s. But efforts to improve air quality by improving fuel quality and enforcing emission standards, among others, had visibly ameliorated the problem by the 2000s. Atmospheric particulate matter levels dropped from 81 micrograms per cubic metre in 1997 to 43 in 2007. However, increasing vehicle numbers and a lack of continued pollution-control efforts threatens a reversal of the past success. In January\u2013February 2018, weather conditions caused bouts of haze to cover the city, with particulate matter under 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) rising to unhealthy levels for several days on end.Although the BMA has created thirty signed bicycle routes along several roads totalling 230 kilometres (140 mi), cycling is still largely impractical, especially in the city centre. Most of these bicycle lanes share the pavement with pedestrians. Poor surface maintenance, encroachment by hawkers and street vendors, and a hostile environment for cyclists and pedestrians, make cycling and walking unpopular methods of getting around in Bangkok.\n\n\n=== Buses and taxis ===\n\nBangkok has an extensive bus network providing local transit services within the Greater Bangkok area. The Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) operates a monopoly on bus services, with substantial concessions granted to private operators. Buses, minibus vans, and song thaeo operate on a total of 470 routes throughout the region. A separate bus rapid transit system owned by the BMA has been in operation since 2010. Known simply as the BRT, the system currently consists of a single line running from the business district at Sathon to Ratchaphruek on the western side of the city. The Transport Co., Ltd. is the BMTA's long-distance counterpart, with services to all provinces operating out of Bangkok.\nTaxis are ubiquitous in Bangkok, and are a popular form of transport. As of August 2012, there are 106,050 cars, 58,276 motorcycles and 8,996 tuk-tuk motorized tricycles cumulatively registered for use as taxis. Meters have been required for car taxis since 1992, while tuk-tuk fares are usually negotiated. Motorcycle taxis operate from regulated ranks, with either fixed or negotiable fares, and are usually employed for relatively short journeys.\nDespite their popularity, taxis have gained a bad reputation for often refusing passengers when the requested route is not to the driver's convenience. Motorcycle taxis were previously unregulated, and subject to extortion by organized crime gangs. Since 2003, registration has been required for motorcycle taxi ranks, and drivers now wear distinctive numbered vests designating their district of registration and where they are allowed to accept passengers.\n\n\n=== Rail systems ===\n\nBangkok is the location of Hua Lamphong Railway Station, the main terminus of the national rail network operated by the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). In addition to long-distance services, the SRT also operates a few daily commuter trains running from and to the outskirts of the city during the rush hour.\nBangkok is served by three rapid transit systems: the BTS Skytrain, the underground MRT, and the elevated Airport Rail Link. Although proposals for the development of rapid transit in Bangkok had been made since 1975, it was only in 1999 that the BTS finally began operation.\nThe BTS consists of two lines, Sukhumvit and Silom, with 43 stations along 51.69 kilometres (32.12 mi). The MRT opened for use in July 2004, and currently consists of two lines, the Blue Line and Purple Line. The Airport Rail Link, opened in August 2010, connects the city center to Suvarnabhumi Airport to the east. Its eight stations span a distance of 28 kilometres (17 mi).\nAlthough initial passenger numbers were low and their service area has long remained limited to the inner city, these systems have become indispensable to many commuters. The BTS reported an average of 600,000 daily trips in 2012, while the MRT had 240,000 passenger trips per day.As of July 2019, construction work is ongoing to extend the city-wide transit system's reach, including the construction of the Light Red grade-separated commuter rail line. The entire Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region consists of eight main lines and four feeder lines totaling 508 kilometres (316 mi) to be completed by 2029. In addition to rapid transit and heavy rail lines, there have been proposals for several monorail systems.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nAlthough much diminished from its past prominence, water-based transport still plays an important role in Bangkok and the immediate upstream and downstream provinces. Several water buses serve commuters daily. The Chao Phraya Express Boat serves thirty-four stops along the river, carrying an average of 35,586 passengers per day in 2010, while the smaller Khlong Saen Saep boat service serves twenty-seven stops on Saen Saep Canal with 57,557 daily passengers. Long-tail boats operate on fifteen regular routes on the Chao Phraya, and passenger ferries at thirty-two river crossings served an average of 136,927 daily passengers in 2010.Bangkok Port, popularly known by its location as Khlong Toei Port, was Thailand's main international port from its opening in 1947 until it was superseded by the deep-sea Laem Chabang Port in 1991. It is primarily a cargo port, though its inland location limits access to ships of 12,000 deadweight tonnes or less. The port handled 11,936,855 tonnes (13,158,130 tons) of cargo in the first eight months of the 2010 fiscal year, about 22 percent the total of the country's international ports.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nBangkok is one of Asia's busiest air transport hubs. Two commercial airports serve the city, the older Don Mueang International Airport and the new Bangkok International Airport, commonly known as Suvarnabhumi. Suvarnabhumi, which replaced Don Mueang as Bangkok's main airport after its opening in 2006, served 52,808,013 passengers in 2015, making it the world's 20th busiest airport by passenger volume. This volume exceeded its designed capacity of 45 million passengers. Don Mueang reopened for domestic flights in 2007, and resumed international service focusing on low-cost carriers in October 2012. Suvarnabhumi is undergoing expansion to increase its capacity to 60 million passengers by 2019 and 90 million by 2021.\n\n\n== Health and education ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nBangkok has long been the centre of modern education in Thailand. The first schools in the country were established here in the later 19th century, and there are now 1,351 schools in the city. The city is home to the country's five oldest universities, Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, Kasetsart, Mahidol and Silpakorn, founded between 1917 and 1943. The city has since continued its dominance, especially in higher education; the majority of the country's universities, both public and private, are located in Bangkok or the Metropolitan Region. Chulalongkorn and Mahidol are the only Thai universities to appear in the top 500 of the QS World University Rankings. King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, also located in Bangkok, is the only Thai university in the top 400 of the 2012\u201313 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.Over the past few decades the general trend of pursuing a university degree has prompted the founding of new universities to meet the needs of Thai students. Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. Ramkhamhaeng University emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital. Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools. Education has long been a prime factor in the centralization of Bangkok and will play a vital role in the government's efforts to decentralize the country.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nMuch of Thailand's medical resources are disproportionately concentrated in the capital. In 2000, Bangkok had 39.6 percent of the country's doctors and a physician-to-population ratio of 1:794, compared to a median of 1:5,667 among all provinces. The city is home to 42 public hospitals, five of which are university hospitals, as well as 98 private hospitals and 4,063 registered clinics. The BMA operates nine public hospitals through its Medical Service Department, and its Health Department provides primary care through sixty-eight community health centres. Thailand's universal healthcare system is implemented through public hospitals and health centres as well as participating private providers.\nResearch-oriented medical school affiliates such as Siriraj, King Chulalongkorn Memorial and Ramathibodi Hospitals are among the largest in the country, and act as tertiary care centres, receiving referrals from distant parts of the country. Lately, especially in the private sector, there has been much growth in medical tourism, with hospitals such as Bumrungrad and Bangkok Hospital, among others, providing services specifically catering to foreigners. An estimated 200,000 medical tourists visited Thailand in 2011, making Bangkok the most popular global destination for medical tourism.\n\n\n== Crime and safety ==\n\nBangkok has a relatively moderate crime rate when compared to urban counterparts around the world. Traffic accidents are a major hazard while natural disasters are rare. Intermittent episodes of political unrest and occasional terrorist attacks have resulted in losses of life.Although the crime threat in Bangkok is relatively low, non-confrontational crimes of opportunity such as pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, and credit card fraud occur with frequency. Bangkok's growth since the 1960s has been followed by increasing crime rates partly driven by urbanisation, migration, unemployment and poverty. By the late 1980s, Bangkok's crime rates were about four times that of the rest of the country. The police have long been preoccupied with street crimes ranging from housebreaking to assault and murder. The 1990s saw the emergence of vehicle theft and organized crime, particularly by foreign gangs. Drug trafficking, especially that of ya ba methamphetamine pills, is also chronic.According to police statistics, the most common complaint received by the Metropolitan Police Bureau in 2010 was housebreaking, with 12,347 cases. This was followed by 5,504 cases of motorcycle thefts, 3,694 cases of assault and 2,836 cases of embezzlement. Serious offences included 183 murders, 81 gang robberies, 265 robberies, 1 kidnapping and 9 arson cases. Offences against the state were by far more common, and included 54,068 drug-related cases, 17,239 cases involving prostitution and 8,634 related to gambling. The Thailand Crime Victim Survey conducted by the Office of Justice Affairs of the Ministry of Justice found that 2.7 percent of surveyed households reported a member being victim of a crime in 2007. Of these, 96.1 percent were crimes against property, 2.6 percent were crimes against life and body, and 1.4 percent were information-related crimes.Political demonstrations and protests are common in Bangkok. While most events since 1992 had been peaceful, the series of protests since 2006 have often turned violent. Demonstrations during March\u2013May 2010 ended in a crackdown in which 92 were killed, including armed and unarmed protesters, security forces, civilians and journalists. Terrorist incidents have also occurred in Bangkok, most notably the 2015 Bangkok bombing at the Erawan shrine, and also a series of bombings on the 2006\u201307 New Year's Eve.\nTraffic accidents are a major hazard in Bangkok. There were 37,985 accidents in the city in 2010, resulting in 16,602 injuries and 456 deaths as well as 426.42 million baht in damages. However, the rate of fatal accidents is much lower than in the rest of Thailand. While accidents in Bangkok amounted to 50.9 percent of the entire country, only 6.2 percent of fatalities occurred in the city. Another serious public health hazard comes from Bangkok's stray dogs. Up to 300,000 strays are estimated to roam the city's streets, and dog bites are among the most common injuries treated in the emergency departments of the city's hospitals. Rabies is prevalent among the dog population, and treatment for bites pose a heavy public burden.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nThe city's formal international relations are managed by the International Affairs Division of the BMA. Its missions include partnering with other major cities through sister city agreements, participation and membership in international organizations, and pursuing cooperative activities with the many foreign diplomatic missions based in the city.\n\n\n=== International participation ===\nBangkok is a member of several international organizations and regional city government networks, including the Asian Network of Major Cities 21, the Japan-led Asian-Pacific City Summit, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the ESCAP-sponsored Regional Network of Local Authorities for Management of Human Settlements in Asia and Pacific (CITYNET), Japan's Council of Local Authorities for International Relations, the World Association of the Major Metropolises and Local Governments for Sustainability, among others.With its location at the heart of mainland Southeast Asia and as one of Asia's hubs of transportation, Bangkok is home to many international and regional organizations. Among others, Bangkok is the seat of the Secretariat of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), as well as the Asia-Pacific regional offices of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n\n\n=== Sister cities ===\nBangkok has made sister city and/or friendship agreements with twenty-eight other cities in nineteen countries, as of 2019. They are:\n\n\n== See also ==\nOutline of Bangkok\nWorld's largest cities\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBaker, Chris; Phongpaichit, Pasuk (2005).

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters. It was closed on September 2009. The surrounding shopping center, Marinoa City Fukuoka, still attracts millions of visitors each year. Other shopping centers that attract tourists include Canal City, JR Hakata City, and Hakata Riverain.Fukuoka Castle, located adjacent to Ohori Park in Maizuru Park, features the remaining stone walls and ramparts left after a devastating fire during the upheaval of the Meiji Restoration. It has now been preserved along with some reconstructed prefabricate concrete towers constructed during the 1950s and 1960s, when there was a trend across Japan to rebuild damaged castles as tourist attractions. \u014chori Park is also the location of one of Fukuoka City's major art galleries.\nThere are many temples with long histories including T\u014dch\u014d-ji, Hakozaki Shrine, Kashii shrine, and J\u014dten-ji.\nThe Marine Park Uminonakamichi is located on a narrow cape on the northern side of the Bay of Hakata.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters. It was closed on September 2009. The surrounding shopping center, Marinoa City Fukuoka, still attracts millions of visitors each year. Other shopping centers that attract tourists include Canal City, JR Hakata City, and Hakata Riverain.Fukuoka Castle, located adjacent to Ohori Park in Maizuru Park, features the remaining stone walls and ramparts left after a devastating fire during the upheaval of the Meiji Restoration. It has now been preserved along with some reconstructed prefabricate concrete towers constructed during the 1950s and 1960s, when there was a trend across Japan to rebuild damaged castles as tourist attractions. \u014chori Park is also the location of one of Fukuoka City's major art galleries.\nThere are many temples with long histories including T\u014dch\u014d-ji, Hakozaki Shrine, Kashii shrine, and J\u014dten-ji.\nThe Marine Park Uminonakamichi is located on a narrow cape on the northern side of the Bay of Hakata.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

          "Less than an hour away from Fukuoka city by train, visitors would trek up a beautiful mountain where the reclining Buddha is. There are many trees and statues in this area. Very few tourists, but is definitely a highlight to any trip to Fukuoka city. I added a bunch of photos to",

          "Just in front of the JR station. It's not a big place, take less then an hour to do but the atmosphere is awesome. It's one of the biggest buddha in Japan. There is a lot of small statue everywhere. A small cave as a temple, very nice. A big colorfull Oni.",

          "The temple is easy access by JR train, from JR Hakata Station to Kido Nanzoin Mae Station take only 21 min. With Sakura Season made the temple and The Buddha more beautiful! If you would like to go into the Buddha will cost 500 Yen and at step 48 you can turn right to warship",

          "Nanzoin is an easy train ride from Fukuoka. Nevertheless it was virtually devoid of tourists when we visited. A few parties of pilgrims were there, otherwise we had this gem almost to ourselves. It will be discovered in time so best to visit it sooner rather than later. The",

          "Went here to see the biggest sleeping Buddha statue.. I loved the location, surrounded by mountains. Location was easy to be reach, once you arrived at Sasaguri machi, the station keeper gave me a small map to reach the location. Not many tourists flock the place, thus I had",
          "This is by far the best place I went in Japan. To me, all the liveliness of the big city and all the people is very tiring. This was an amazingly beautiful, calm and peaceful place. There were very few people, only a few japanese people and no tourists apart from myself. It was",

          "At first. You have to select shoes that are easy to walk in. That's why Nanzo-in Temple is located at the foot of Mountain. You have to move up and down steep stairways and road. Reclining Buddha is very impressive. More Japanese visitors are expected every year. That's why,this",
          "Nanzo-in temple was definitely the crown jewel of my trip to Fukuoka. It's rare for something so massive to leave you both awestruck and tranquil at the same time. Most of the photos you'll see won't give you the scale of this statue; a single toe is roughly the size of a grown",

          "Do spend some time and enjoy the serene environment. It's only about 20min train ride from Hakata station, and the beauty of the huge reclining Buddha is worth the visit! It's free, unless you want to go within the Buddha (500 yen). Do remember to check out the melody bridge",

Its greenhouse contains over 1,200 plant species including orchids, ferns, and cacti.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe gardens were originally established near the city's East park in 1933 as part of the celebration of the coronation of Emperor Hirohito. This small 5,096-tsubo (1.685 ha) zoo and botanical garden included about 500 animals and 100 species of plants. The zoo was closed to the public on 20 May 1944 due to the deteriorating state of World War II for the country. Large animals were subsequently euthanized. Pillars from the old zoo gate are still standing near one of the elementary schools in the city.In 1949 the city approved the establishment of a zoo in the city's South park. The Fukuoka City Zoological Society was established in 1952, and \u00a528 million was raised for the new zoo.The zoo opened in its current location on 22 August 1953, with 143 animals representing 69 species. It included a play area with a miniature train and a Ferris wheel. When it opened, the zoo was home to one elephant, who was still living at the zoo in 2011.In 1954 the zoo was expanded to the North by about 6,500-tsubo (21,000 m2), and the animal collection expanded to include 353 individuals representing 110 species. In 1955 the zoo was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Tourism Division, Fukuoka. An additional 6 hectares (15 acres) was added to the zoo in 1956, and the animal collection again expanded to include 400 individuals of 120 species.By 2003 (the fiftieth anniversary of opening in its current location), the zoo had hosted more than 40 million visitors, and was home to 706 animals representing 168 species, including 57 species of mammals, 88 species of birds, and 23 species of reptiles.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Japan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fukuoka City Zoological Garden at Wikimedia Commons \n\nOfficial website (Japanese)",

          "If you care for animal happiness don't go! To small cages, no space, bad environment. I hope they will renovate the zoo soon in order to give the animals a better life. This is not acceptable!",
          "So many animals will make children excited. But so many up and down in the park. Hence stamina is necessary.",
          "It's a very big place with lots of different animals. Some animals have small cages, while others have big spaces. The animals look well and healthy. The botanical garden is also very big and the flowers are beautiful. The greenhouse is amazing. Loved walking around there.",
          "The garden was fun to walk around even though it was subdued since the season was not in full bloom. I wish there was a garden-only ticket because I had no desire to view the animals after reading other reviews here.",

          "Here's a great place in the heart of Fukuoka City for the entire family. Adults and kids will enjoy this place as well. It looks like the city put some money and resources into revamping this zoo and facilities over the last few years, and \u2026",

          "Nice environment, very green and lots of space for kids to run around! The animals don't have much space but that's unfortunately very common in Japan. Still a good way for kids so see new animals. The adjacent botanical garden is great and the entry fee is really cheap.",

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded.

The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector.

It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals. The costumes are worn with pride and are considered appropriate wear for even formal occasions, such as weddings and cocktail parties, during the festival.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Hakata Dontaku ====\nHakata Dontaku (\u535a\u591a\u3069\u3093\u305f\u304f) is held in Fukuoka City on May 3 and 4.

        "wiki": "Dazaifu (\u592a\u5bb0\u5e9c\u5e02, Dazaifu-shi) is a city located in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, part of the greater Fukuoka metropolitan area.  Nearby cities include \u014cnoj\u014d and Chikushino. Although mostly mountainous, it does have arable land used for paddy fields and market gardening.\nAs of October 2018, the city has an estimated population of 72,231 with 29,355 households and a population density of 2,440 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 29.58 km\u00b2.\nThe city was officially founded on April 1, 1982, although it has been important historically for more than a thousand years. It was an administrative capital of Fukuoka at around 663 CE.\n\n\n== History ==\nDazaifu was the imperial office governing Ky\u016bsh\u016b (corresponding to Tagaj\u014d in T\u014dhoku) after it was moved from present-day Fukuoka City in 663. \nAccording to the Taiho Code of 701, an attempt by the Yamato state to exert further control over its territories, Dazaifu was given two principal administrative functions: to supervise the affairs of Tsukushi (present-day Kyushu) and to receive foreign emissaries. Dazaifu hosted foreign embassies from China and Korea. K\u014drokan, a guesthouse for foreign embassies, was also established. The Korokan featured in contemporary literature, such as the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, as a place of departure for ocean voyages. \nFrom the Nara period through the Heian period and until the Kamakura period, Dazaifu was one of the military and administrative centers of Japan.\nGovernment records indicate that the disastrous Japanese smallpox epidemic that took place from 735 to 737 first took hold in Dazaifu.In the Heian period, Dazaifu was a place of exile for high-ranking courtiers. Nobles exiled there include Sugawara no Michizane. His grave is at Dazaifu Tenman-g\u016b.\nDazaifu was sometimes attacked by rebels. At other times the head of Dazaifu himself raised a rebellion. In 739 the powerful nobleman Fujiwara Hirotsugu was appointed to Dazaifu. He soon organised a rebellion, raising 15,000 men. After three months, the uprising was suppressed by 17,000 court troops. In 939 another nobleman, Fujiwara Sumitomo, rebelled against the court. Allying himself with pirates, in 941 he landed in Kyushu. Then he defeated the troops guarding Dazaifu and burned the state buildings. Due to this and other developments, Dazaifu never regained its earlier prestige.With the invasions of the Mongols and the decline of imperial authority, Dazaifu became less politically significant. In the Muromachi period the political center of Ky\u016bsh\u016b was moved to Hakata.\nIn medieval times, Dazaifu was the base of the Sh\u014dni clan. The Sh\u014dni were later expelled by the \u014cuchi clan.\nIn the Edo period, Dazaifu was a part of the Kuroda han until its abolition in 1873.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nThe Kyushu National Museum opened on October 16, 2005. A wood and glass building in a hilly landscape, it hosts collections of Japanese artifacts related to the history of Ky\u016bsh\u016b.\nK\u014dmy\u014dzen-ji is a Zen temple famous for its stone garden. It was built during the Kamakura period just next to Dazaifu Tenman-g\u016b. Another temple, Kanzeon-ji, was built in the 8th century. It was once the chief Buddhist temple on Ky\u016bsh\u016b and houses a number of historical, artistic, and religious treasures. All three are within walking distance of Nishitetsu Dazaifu Station. \nThe ruins of the medieval Dazaifu Administrative Buildings, also located within walking distance of Dazaifu Station, are today a public park.\nThere is small museum about Sugawara no Michizane, who died in exile in Dazaifu in 903.\n\nThe Starbucks coffeeshop in Dazaifu has a unique design by Kengo Kuma.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are several universities in the city:\n\nChikushi Jogakuen University\nFukuoka International University\nFukuoka University of Economics\nFukuoka Social Medical Welfare UniversityArea primary and junior high schools are administered by the Dazaifu Board of Education.\n\nDazaifu Minami Elementary School\nDazaifu Higashi Elementary School\nDazaifu Nishi Elementary School\nDazaifu Elementary School\nMizuki Nishi Elementary School\nMizuki Elementary School\nKokubu Elementary School\nGakugyouin Junior High School\nDazaifu Higashi Junior High School\nDazaifu Nishi Junior High School\nDazaifu Junior High SchoolThe prefecture operates senior high schools\n\nChikushidai High School\nFukuoka Prefectural Dazaifu High School\n\n\n== See also ==\nDazaifu (government)\nDazaifu Line\nTofur\u014dminami Station\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and K\u00e4the Roth.

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals.

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2.

The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams.

        "wiki": "Kyushu Railway (\u4e5d\u5dde\u9244\u9053, Ky\u016bsh\u016b Tetsud\u014d) was a company that built and operated railways in Kyushu, one of four main islands of Japan. Most of its lines came under the control of Japanese Government Railways following nationalization in 1907, and many are now operated by Kyushu Railway Company.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was incorporated on August 15, 1888 in Fukuoka, Fukuoka.\nThe first 22 miles (35 km) of the railway, between Hakata Station in Fukuoka and Chitosegawa temporary station in Asahi, Saga (near Kurume, Fukuoka), opened on December 11, 1889 as the first railway in Kyushu.The company expanded the railway by means of both construction and acquisition of other companies. As of 1907, it operated 442.8 miles (712.6 km) of railways in Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Nagasaki, \u014cita and Saga prefectures in northern Kyushu.\nOn July 1, 1907, the entire operation of the company was purchased by the government of Japan under the Railway Nationalization Act. Consequently, the company was dissolved.\n\n\n== List of lines ==\n\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\nA special coach made by German car manufacturer van der Zypen & Charlier was imported by Kyushu Railway for VIP use in 1891. The coach was improved and designated as the imperial coach in 1902 for use by Emperor Meiji when he visited an army drill in Kumamoto Prefecture. After the nationalization, the coach was called the imperial coach No. 2 but was not used again by the emperor. It was designated a railway heritage (\u9244\u9053\u8a18\u5ff5\u7269, tetsud\u014d kinenbutsu) in 1963 and is now exhibited at the Railway Museum in Saitama.\n\n\n== Kyushu Railway History Museum ==\n\nThe Kyushu Railway History Museum was established near Mojik\u014d Station in Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b in 2003. The red-brick main building of the museum is the former headquarters of Kyushu Railway.\n\n\n== References ==\nIshino, Tetsu;  et al., eds.

        "wiki": "Fukuoka Castle (\u798f\u5ca1\u57ce, Fukuoka-j\u014d) is a Japanese castle located in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. It is also known as Maizuru Castle (\u821e\u9db4\u57ce Maizuru-j\u014d) or Seki Castle (\u77f3\u57ce Seki-j\u014d). Completed in the early Edo period for tozama daimy\u014d Kuroda Nagamasa, it has been decreed a historic site by the Japanese government.\nThe castle lies in the centre of Fukuoka, on top of Fukusaki hill. The Naka River (\u90a3\u73c2), Naka-gawa in Japanese, acts as a natural moat on the eastern side of the castle, while the western side uses a mudflat as a natural moat. Hakata, a ward with a bustling port, is located on the opposite side of the Naka River to the east. The castle town was established on the northern side, facing the sea.\nMuch of the castle grounds has been converted to Maizuru Park, which houses several sports facilities, a courthouse, and an art museum. Heiwadai Baseball Stadium, the past home field of the Nishitetsu Lions and the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, was also located on the castle grounds. Some of the castle's gates as well as its towers and turrets, known as yaguras, are preserved inside the park, one of which has been marked as an important historical artifact by the Japanese government.\nThe remnants of a korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928), an ancient guest house for foreign diplomats, were discovered under the castle grounds in 1987, showing that the castle was a vital geographical checkpoint even into the Heian period. This is the only korokan remnant found in all of Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1600, Kuroda Nagamasa received huge rewards in the form of land in Chikuzen Province for his contributions during the Battle of Sekigahara and moved into Najima Castle (\u540d\u5cf6\u57ce Najima-j\u014d) to form the Fukuoka han. Najima Castle had been created by Tachibana Akitoshi and was expanded by Kobayakawa Takakage, but was much too small to accommodate a large han, leading to the selection of Fukusaki hill as a new castle site.\nConstruction began in 1601 (Keich\u014d year 6). Yoshitaka, an expert at establishing fortifications, and Noguchi Kazunari, a stonemason who had worked on Edo Castle and Osaka Castle, directed the construction. Completed in 1607 (Keich\u014d year 12) after seven years of work, the castle is said to have contained an impressive 47 yaguras, and covered an area of 47,000 square metres (making it the largest in the Ky\u016bsh\u016b region). Kat\u014d Kiyomasa of the nearby Kumamoto han lauded the castle for its grandeur. The dry stone fortification designed by Noguchi was especially impressive, giving the castle the name \"Seki-j\u014d\" (literally \"Stone Castle\").\nThe castle and castle town were renamed \"Fukuoka\" from \"Fukusaki\", after Fukuoka of Bizen Province (current Setouchi, Okayama), where the Kuroda family had originated.\nSeveral minor repairs were made during the Edo period, and full-scale renovation was conducted during the Bakumatsu period.\nIn 1871, (Meiji year 4) the abolition of the han system forced the abandonment of the castle. Many of the buildings inside the castle grounds were taken down or moved to other locations.\n\nIn 1920, (Taish\u014d year 9) the Kinen Yagura was relocated to Taish\u014d temple in Yahata Higashi-ku, Kitakyushu. The building was moved back to its original location in 1983.\nOn August 29, 1957, the castle was decreed a historic site by the Japanese government. Additional gates and yaguras were also decreed historical artifacts by the prefectural government in 1952, 1961, 1971 and 1957.\nPart of the second main gate was set on fire by a vandal in 2000. Reconstruction of the gate is currently under way.\n\n\n== Selection of locale ==\nAfter his overwhelming victory in the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Kuroda Nagamasa was installed as the ruler of Chikuzen Province which he received in exchange for his six counties in Buzen Province. He established his quarters at Najima Castle together with his father, Josui.\nNajima Castle was located on a peninsula projecting into Hakata Bay on the north of the estuary of the Tatara River. The castle fundamentally consisted of the hon-maru, the ni-no-maru, and the san-no-maru, respectively ranging from west to east, and extending for over 900 metres (2953 ft) (maru is here a term referring to a space within a castle's grounds). Built by Kobayakawa Takakage, an illustrious Japanese general, it was an impregnable castle. However, when the aspects of politics and economics were considered, it turned out to be undesirable as the administrative centre of the province, for it seemed impossible to construct an extensive castle town because of the river on the south, the sea on the north and the west, and the foothills on the east.  On top of that, the castle was located far from Hakata, a large business centre.\nAccordingly, Nagamasa and Josui made a survey of four sites: Sumiyoshi, Hakozaki, Aratsu-yama hill (present-day Nishi-k\u014den Park), and Fukuzaki. After careful consideration, Fukuzaki was chosen as the castle site. Fukuzaki, in the proximity of Hakata, was a place where a castle town could easily be constructed, and it was valuable as a naval port; furthermore, it had geostrategic advantages; it was surrounded by a cove, rivers, and hills.  Thus Josui chose Fukuzaki, which is present-day Fukuoka, now one of the largest cities in Japan.\n\n\n== Castle components ==\n\nThe construction of Fukuoka Castle began in 1601 and was completed in 1607.  The plan is considered to have been directed by Kuroda Nagamasa.  An old document suggests that Kuroda Nagamasa planned a gate and its surrounding area after many consultations with his distinguished commanding officers.\nThe process of construction is fairly well known, based on archaeological and geological research and old documents, which provided the details for developing an understanding of the process of castle construction.\nBecause there had been a range of hills from the Akasaka-yama hill (present-day Sakurazaka 2 chome), which is about 30 metres (98 ft) above sea level, to the hill which was to become the site of the hon-maru, an area to the south of the castle was excavated to form a moat.  The hills to the south of the moat were also excavated and altered to become gently sloping hills. The top section of a hillock to the northwest of the inner castle was also truncated because it was higher than the hon-maru. The hillock was then used as the site for a retirement residence for Kuroda Yoshitaka.\nA cove or an inlet on the west of the inner castle, in which \u014chori Park and Arato are now situated, was utilized for the Ohori Moat (Big Moat) in the cove's southern half and for a town in its northern half by a reclaiming and dredging process.  At the same time the Hii (Tajima) River, which was flowing into the cove, was diverted from its course to the west.\nOn the west of the inner castle, two linear moats were excavated from the inner castle to the confluence of the Shiju River (the present-day Yakuin-shin River) and the Naka River.\nThis large scale construction required a great number of stones.  An analysis of their composition reveals that they came from the islands of Noko-no-shima, Itoshima, Sawara and Kashii, and the region from Noma to Teratsuka.  According to old books, the stones and buildings of the dismantled Najima Castle were shipped to Fukuoka and the stones which had been used for the Genko Borui walls (walls built to thwart the Mongolian invaders) and the ancient burial mounds in and around Hirao village and the Hirao-yama hills were also reused for Fukuoka Castle.  From these facts it can be inferred that the constructors of the castle had a difficult time collecting the stones.  The important walls were constructed under the direction of Noguchi Sasuke Kazushige, who was renowned for his skills in construction stone walls, and who in later years participated in the construction of Edo Castle and Osaka Castle.\nFor the castle construction, wealthy merchants, Kamiya Sotan and Shimai Soshitsu, provided greatly appreciated financial help.  After completing the project, Yoshitaka and Nagamasa named the castle, \"Fukuoka\", in commemoration of the land of his forefathers, which is present-day Fukuoka, Setouchi-shi, Okayama Prefecture.\n\n\n=== Hon-maru ===\nA hon-maru is a kuruwa located in the heart of a Japanese castle, which is a complex of kuruwas.  Fukuoka Castle was built in the style of Teikaku-shiki or Hashigokaku-shiki (a plan in which the hon-maru, ni-no-maru, and san-no-maru share common defensive lines on one side, because the topography and the castle plan gives a particular advantage to that side) and its hon-maru is situated in the south of the inner castle.  The hon-maru measures 125 metres (410 ft) from east to west, and 230 metres (755 ft) from north to south.\nThe hon-maru is shaped like an abbreviated form of a cross because of the complicated exterior lines of stone walls.  The de-sumis (salient corners) on the north side of the hon-maru are rectangular flanking projections which increase the castle's defensibility; the iri-sumis (receded corners) on the south side of the hon-maru also increase the castle's defensibility because they permit cross fire at the enemy at the southern corners of the hon-maru.  The top of the foundation of the dai-tenshu (large donjon) is 36.3 metres (119 ft) above sea level, and at the centre of the hon-maru, 23 metres (76 ft) above sea level. The hon-maru of Fukuoka Castle was divided into a northern part and a southern part by the stone foundations for the sho-tenshu (small donjon), the ch\u016b-tenshu (medium donjon), the dai-tenshu (large donjon), and the kanritsu-shiki tenshu-kuruwa (a kuruwa formed of rectangular buildings as the final strategic position in time of siege). The southern part is apparently the tenshu-kuruwa (a kuruwa especially designed for the defence of the tenshu), playing the role of the tsume-no-maru (a kuruwa for the final fighting of a siege), and it is the most fortified place in the castle.  On the northwest corner of the foundation of the tenshu,  the tenshu kuruwa has in addition the kanritsu-shiki tenshu-kuruwa.  This particular feature indicates that the castle's purpose was defensive.\nThe foundation for the dai-tenshu (large donjon) measures about 24.8 metres (81 ft) from east to west, and 22.4 metres (74 ft) from north to south, and covers an area the size of the first floor of the tenshu of Himeji Castle, which has an area of 550.025 square metres.  It has long been believed that there had not been a tenshu on the foundation; however, indirect descriptions of a tenshu are seen in a few old documents and the existence of an annex for the tenshu is indicated on some old maps.  The problem is now being studied by various researchers. (Kuroda Nagamasa tried to destroy all the documents which were related to Christianity.  Since \"tenshu\" also means \"(Christian) God\", it is possible that he destroyed almost all the documents which contained the word \"tenshu\".)\nThe hon-maru residence, which was located to the north of the foundation of the dai-tenshu (large donjon), served as a domicile for lords until the second lord, Kuroda Tadayuki, built a new residence in the san-no-maru.  In the hon-maru residence, there was a 56 tatami-mat (109 sq.m. in Chikuzen) audience chamber and the Shaka-no-ma (Buddha Room) where Iken-kai (regular meetings in which principal retainers were permitted to freely speak their opinions whether they agreed with the lord's position or opinion or not) were held.\nIn the hon-maru, there were some Shinto shrines, as in the case of many other castles in Japan.  On the west of the foundation of the dai-tenshu (large donjon), there was a Niyakuichioji Shrine.  This shrine was a branch of the Kego Shrine, which was dedicated to three gods of war.  In Meiwa 5 (1768), the Seisho-Gongen Shrine was built to the east of the foundation of the dai-tenshu to deify Kuroda Nagamasa, and in An'ei 2 (1773) the Suikyo-Gongen Shrine was raised to honor Kuroda Yoshitaka in the same building.  Both  shrines are still in existence in their new location in Nishi-koen Park (on Arato-yama hill) as one shrine, today called the \"Terumo Shrine.\"\n\n\n=== Ni-no-maru ===\nA ni-no-maru (as a common noun) is the second most important kuruwa.  The ni-no-maru of Fukuoka Castle consists of four major kuruwas; i.e., Ni-no-kuruwa, Ni-no-maru (as a proper noun), Minami-no-maru, the mizunote, and some minor kuruwas, all which are adjacent to the hon-maru.\nThe height of the Ni-no-kuruwa, which is an elongated L-shaped kuruwa, is 17\u201318 metres (56\u201359 ft.) above sea level with the dimension of about 310 metres (1017 ft) from north to south.  This kuruwa was designed to defend the gates of the hon-maru and functioned as a key kuruwa which controlled access to the hon-maru through its many gates.  This kuruwa is well fortified; for example, it had a kakushi-guruwa (a hidden kuruwa), which was located to the south of the Kirinoki-zaka Gate and used for laying an ambush against an approaching enemy.  Depicted in some old maps are several yaguras and something like a hitching post stable, but there are no other buildings, such as a residence complex.\nThe rectangular Ni-no-maru measures 135 metres (443 ft) from east to west, 150 metres (492 ft) from north to south, and 15\u201317 metres (49\u201356 ft.) above sea level.  A map made in the early 17th century shows a residence bounded by yaguras, walls, and nagayas (long structures).  Another illustrated map of the castle made during the reign of the third lord, Kuroda Mitsuyuki, has a note about this kuruwa which says, \"Ni-no-maru, the residence of Hizen-no-kami.\"  Considering that Hizen-no-kami (an honorary title which meant \"governor of Hizen\") was the title given to the heir of Mitsuyuki, this compound was used as the residence of the heir to the lordship, at least when the map was made in the late 17th century.  In addition, another old document indicates that the residence of Mitsuyuki, then the heir of Lord Tadayuki, was in the Ni-no-maru, while yet another document says that during the reign of the fifth lord Nobumasa, his uncle Nagakiyo, the lord of the county of Nogata, had stayed in the Ni-no-maru when he visited Fukuoka.  The kuruwa, which is mentioned in the two latter documents, probably refers to the Ni-no-maru.\nThe Minami-no-maru, another kuruwa shaped like a rectangle, measures about 70 metres (230 ft) from east to west and 110 metres (361 ft) from north to south.  The height of the top of the foundation is more than 20 metres (66 ft) above sea level.  This kuruwa was not only a defence against an enemy approaching from the south but also a kind of kakushi-guruwa (hidden kuruwa) where an ambush could be laid to launch a pincer attack from this kuruwa and the hon-maru on enemy soldiers approaching the hon-maru.  Some documents indicate that there was a residence for the deputy castellan (the lord's councilor who was in charge of the castle during the lord's absence).\nThe mizunote, which has a dimension of about 120 metres (394 ft) from east to west and 160 metres (525 ft) from north to south, was situated to the east of the hon-maru.  The mizunote is a kuruwa which has a well or a reservoir for drinking water.  In Fukuoka Castle, the mizunote was built with a catchment reservoir which, in times of siege, also played the role of a sutebori-moat which forced the enemies to take a roundabout way to attack.  In addition to the sutebori-moat, there was an L-shaped obi-guruwa along the sides of the hon-maru and Ni-no-maru, enabling simultaneous defensive fire from various levels.  According to a report (\"The Intelligence Report on the Provinces of Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen and Higo\") on this castle which was made by a sh\u014dgun's shinobi or ninja-spy, there was a flower garden surrounded by bamboo bushes to the south of the reservoir.\n\n\n=== San-no-maru ===\nThe inner castle of Fukuoka Castle is the area surrounded by a continuous moat, which measures about 1000 metres (3281 ft) from east to west and 700 metres (2297 ft) from north to south.  Even without the moat, the inner castle of Fukuoka Castle, in its grandiose scale, is as large as some of the castles built by the Tokugawa Shogunate, such as Nagoya Castle and Osaka Castle of the Tokugawa Period.  However, thanks to the wide roads which ran throughout the san-no-maru, especially from the Kami-no-hashi Gateway through the Shimo-no-hashi Gateway, soldiers could move quickly to the point of attack in case of fire concentrated at some point of the castle.\nThe san-no-maru, which is also called the san-no-kuruwa, covers a large proportion of this inner castle and is divided into an eastern section and a western section by the Matsunoki-zaka Approach, Takayashiki, and the stone walls between them.  The foundation level of the western section is 5\u20136 metres (16\u201320 ft.) above sea level, while the eastern section is 2\u20133 metres higher than the western section within the mound lines along the moats, which were 8\u201317 metres above sea level.  The height of Takayashiki is approximately 13 metres (43 ft).\nIn the eastern section, soon after the castle's completion, Kuroda Zusho, Kuroda Yoshin, Mori/Bori Tajima, and Kuriyama Bingo (principal retainers) initially occupied the residences that were aligned along the edge of the northern moat of the inner castle, from the eastern edge of the inner castle to the Shimo-no-hashi Gateway. On the east of the Ni-no-maru, there was another residence which was initially occupied by Inoue Suo.  These residences were continuously occupied by principal retainers from the time of the castle's completion through the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  The principal retainers who resided in these residences were often required by their lord's command to relocate there, as were the residents in the castle town.  These retainers' residences, which were all approximately the same size, enabled an effective defensive disposition.  A castle's garrison of soldiers is said to have been one to two soldiers per tsubo (4 sq.m.), and accordingly, each residence could contain 1000\u20132000 soldiers.\nAfter the completion of the castle, in the western section of the inner castle were the Daikan-cho residential quarters.  The structural divisions depicted on the map of \"The Intelligence Report on the Provinces of Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen and Higo\", which was written by a sh\u014dgun's shinobi and compiled in Kan'ei-4 (1627), probably reflect the early days of this castle.  The \"Illustrated Map of All Fukuoka and Hakata\", made in Sh\u014dh\u014d-3 (1646), shows different structural divisions in the western section.  According to this map, there were five residences for principal retainers in the western section, and the lord's residence was on the west of the stone wall between the Matsunoki-zaka Approach and the Kirinoki-zaka Approach.  The only other facility depicted in the map besides the residences was an independent section of the finance department to the south of Takayashiki.  A facsimile of a map which was supposedly made in Kanbun-11 (1671) shows that the lord's residence had moved to the west of Takayashiki.  This is the residence which was newly built in the same year, and it went by the name of O-shita-no-yashiki.  From this time, the lord's residence did not move until the end of Tokugawa Shogunate.  In H\u014dreki-13 (1763), a considerable part of the O-shita-no-yashiki Residence was destroyed by fire and reconstructed the following year.  The residence then underwent renovation in Meiwa-7 (1770).  The residence contained an audience chamber where the lord met with his retainers, the lord's living quarters, a large and a small study, a lesson room, secretaries' office, a recording room, a finance department office, anterooms for principal retainers and five commissioners, an apartment complex for court ladies, a kitchen, a granary which stored the five primary food staples, a charcoal storehouse, an archive, a treasury storehouse, a noh stage, and no less than 15 wells.\nOn the north of the O-shita-no-yashiki Residence, there were two sections of structures previously used as the principal retainer's residences.  This site was then used for the Kita-no-maru (an annex to the O-shita-no-yashiki Residence where the mistresses of the lord lived), the firewood storehouse, the treasurer's residence, treasure houses, a wood workshop, and a flower garden.\nOn the south of the O-shita-no-yashiki Residence there were two sections of structures previously used as principal retainers' residences. These were replaced by a Goyo-yashiki, which may have been a government officials' apartment complex, and then a horse riding ground in Meiwa 8 (1771).  In Bunka-8 (1811), the hawkers' office was moved from the south of the castle to an area adjacent to the riding ground.\nFacing the Oimawashi Gateway lies the Uemono-kuruwa where the wall stones bear many types of seals carved into them.  These seals indicate the groups belonging to different principle retainers at the quarries which provided stones for the castle's construction.  This practice enabled administrators to accurately credit retainers with their contribution.\n\n\n=== Mounds and moats of the inner castle ===\nThe inner castle of Fukuoka Castle is clearly defined by mounds and moats from the outer castle and the extramural areas.  Most of the mounds are well preserved today and they still show the defense capability they offered.\nThe height of the mound of the inner castle is about 8 meters (26 ft) along the Ohori Moat (Big Moat), 12 metres (39 ft) on the east side, 17 metres (56 ft) at the southeast corner of the mizunote, and 16 metres (53 ft) to the west of the hon-maru above sea level.  On the north side, although most of the mound is damaged, it can be inferred that it was about 10 metres above sea level if we consider the detailed accounts of \"The Illustrated Map of All Fukuoka and Hakata\".  Except on the southern side, the mound of the inner castle was usually characterized by a koshimaki-sekirui or a mizutataki-ishigaki (a revetment constructed at the lower part of the mound), some of which can still be seen.  In addition, around the gates were strengthened stone walls, which are 10 metres (33 ft) high.\nIn Keicho 20 (1615), the mound was planted with pine trees that acted as shitomi-uemono (visual barriers), prevented landslides, and served as windbreaks, as flaming torches, as building materials, and as emergency food.  On the western and eastern sides, the mound lines have many ori (cremaillere, a front or face with receding steps, which consists of short and long branches) which permit flanking fire.  The byobu-ori (tenaille lines formed by making alternate angles salient and re-entering), which can be seen from the south of the inner castle to the area to the east of the inner castle, is enormous.  In general, byobu-ori have been shown to resemble the defensive lines of western fortifications.  They thus bear eloquent witness to the depth of the foresight of \"Kuroda Yoshitaka\".\nThe moats of Fukuoka Castle were very wide compared with the castles of other tozama-daimyos (feudal lords who did not become retainers of the Tokugawa until after the decisive victory of Tokugawa at the battle of Sekigahara in 1600).  The moat is about 115 metres (377 ft) wide on the southeast, and on the south, where there are high mounds on both sides of the moat, about 45 metres (148 ft), while to the north of the castle, it is about 70 metres (230 ft) wide on average.  The Ohori Moat (Big Moat) has a width of about 600 metres (1969 ft), even after the construction of the Odote Causeway on the west of the Ohori Moat.  The single, wide moat surrounding the inner castle is one of the features of this castle and only in few other castles built in the modern period can such an example be seen.  The Ohori Moat was originally more than 3 ken (5.9 metres in Chikuzen) deep, and as for the other moats, more than 1 ken (2.0 metres in Chikuzen) deep at both sides, and more than 3 ken deep in the middle of the moat.\nBy the mid-17th century, the Ohori Moat, formed by reclaiming and dredging a large cove at the time of castle construction, was filled with sediment and the Torikai area was drained and turned into grassy land.  Accordingly, during the period of Empo (1673\u20131689), the area that was turned into land was developed into rice fields, and the Odote Causeway was built along the shorelines.  At the same time, the Komo River was modified to flow on the west of the Odote Causeway so that the silt in the flows would be carried to the sea by the river.  After these works, the dimensions of the Ohori Moat were reduced; the water surface was however still more than twice as large as the present Ohori.\n\n\n== Outer castle ==\nAn outer castle is a kuruwa that includes the castle town, comprising samurai quarters, commoners' dwellings and temples.  This kuruwa is clearly demarcated by defensive lines which consisted of moats, mound lines and gates that separated it from the areas outside the castle.  Various writers of old texts differ with regard to the exterior boundaries of the outer castle of Fukuoka Castle; some indicate a smaller area, and some indicate a larger area, but when considering the viewpoint of the science of fortifications, it can be said that the Naka River, the Hizen Moat (present-day Tenjin 1-2 chome), the Naka Moat (present-day Daimyo 1-2 chome), the inner castle, the Tojin-machi-guchi Moat (present-day, Kuromon-gawa-dori Street), and the sea define the boundaries of the outer castle of Fukuoka Castle.  The outer castle of Fukuoka Castle measures no less than about 3 km (1.9 mi) from east to west.\nThe east side of the outer castle along the Naka River was fortified by stone walls which were about 10 metres (33 ft) high and more than 700 metres (2297 ft) long.  At the midpoint of the stone walls, at the entrance from the Nakajima-nishi Bridge, was the Higashi-toriire Gate.  The Higashi-toriire Gate was composed of the Kita-mon (the North Gatehouse), the Minami-mon (the South Gatehouse), and a yagura.  (A gateway structure where a masugata gateway has two gatehouses facing each other, or where a yagura is placed facing the front of a masugata gate forecourt, is unique.)  This grand gateway and the stone walls of the newly built capital of Chikuzen looked down on and strongly dominated the city of Hakata, which had a very long history as a mercantile city.  An old book indicates that there was a Roman Catholic church near the gate, within the walls.  This may be the church built in memory of Kuroda Josui, which is mentioned in an annual report of a Jesuit missionary to Japan.\nThe southern side of the outer castle was demarcated by the inner castle and two linear moats along with mound lines, the total length of which was 1,200 metres (3937 ft).  There were three gates along the mound lines.  These were called the Akasaka Gate, the Yakui Gate, and the Kazuma Gate (Haruyoshi Gate), respectively from west to east.  The moat between the Akasaka Gate Entranceway and the Yakui Gate Entranceway was called the Hizen Moat (Saga Moat), because it was excavated with the help of Nabeshima Naoshige, who was then lord of Hizen Province.  The Naka Moat was about 60\u2013110 metres (197\u2013361 ft.) wide, and the Hizen Moat was about 60\u201380 metres (197\u2013263 ft.) wide.  Both moats are considerably wider than the moats surrounding outer castles in most of the other Japanese castles.  The \"Chronicle of Lord Naoshige\" says that Kuroda Nagamasa sent laborers from Chikuzen to Hizen to excavate the moat on the east of the North Gate Entranceway of Saga Castle in return for the Hizen Moat construction.  The moat, excavated with the help of Nagamasa, was called the Chikuzen Moat.\nOn the west side of the outer castle, there was the Tojin-machi-kuchi Moat (Yana Moat) which was about 17\u201335 metres (56\u2013115 ft.) wide.  Along the eastern side of this moat, there was the Matsu-dote (Pine Mound), while along the Ohori Moat continuing from the south end of the Matsu-dote there was the Sugi-dote (Cedar Mound).  On the Matsu-dote defensive line there was a single storey gate, the Kuro Gate, which, unlike the other gates of the outer castle, was not a masugata gate.  There was a weir at the north end of the moat, and fish were kept in water taken in from the sea.\nIn 1863, two major batteries and seven minor batteries were built along the shorelines of the outer castle, as well as other batteries around Hakata Bay due to the threat of foreign invasion.\n\n\n== External defensive elements ==\nDefensive elements can also be seen in the areas outside the castle.  To the east of the outer castle, Hakata had already been fortified when castle construction began.  The defensive lines of this mercantile city probably appeared during the time of the Mongolian invasions in the late 13th century, when a series of walls was constructed to thwart the invaders.  In the 16th century, the age of civil wars, Hakata was fortified in full-scale by diverting the course of the Hie (Mikasa) River to the east of Hakata and excavating moats to the south.  After the construction of Fukuoka Castle, Hakata seems to have been designated as a demaru (a detached work placed in front of a gate to cover it) defending the Higashi-toriire Gate together with Nakajima (a man-made island on the estuary of the Naka River).  To the east of Hakata there was the Ishido Entranceway and Gate, and on the south, the Tsujinodo Entranceway and Gate.  Although these gates were located outside the outer castle of Fukuoka Castle, they were still designated as castle gates.\nThe Yakui River, which was to the south of the outer castle, not only made up a defensive line in itself, but also played an important role in preventing the moat around the inner castle, the Naka Moat and the Hizen Moat, from accumulating the silt which flowed from the heights of the hills to the south of the inner castle.  In Enp\u014d-6 (1678), a bridge that connected Haruyoshi Town and the Kazuma Gate Entranceway was newly built.  It was placed obliquely so that enemies could not attack the gate directly.  To the west of the castle were the Komo (Myoan-ji) and Hii (Tajima) Rivers, which served as defensive barriers.\n\n\n== Castle town ==\nDefensive aspects of Japanese castles extend to the castle towns which surround them. Temple placement at strategic points and street design are the most notable examples.  In and around Fukuoka Castle, several Buddhist temples were placed at strategic locations, probably because temple buildings could be used as barracks, temple courtyards as assembling places, and tombstones from temple cemeteries as material to build stone walls.  Even after the completion of Fukuoka Castle, temples were still being relocated to strategic points, and in consequence the castle was fortified by degrees.\nIn the castle town, many streets were planned to be T-shaped or L-shaped, and the streets that led to the Higashi-toriire Gate and to the Kuro Gate were curved.  This planning, which is typical of city planning in castle towns of the Edo Period (1603\u20131868), weakened the enemy's psychological and strategic ability to attack while at the same time it enabled temporary defensive lines to be constructed more easily.  This street layout makes modern city planning difficult, and Fukuokans are still having problems driving the severely angled streets which follow the original street design of the castle town.  At the same time, it is one of the vestiges of Fukuoka Castle which reminds the inhabitants that they are living in a city that developed from a well-fortified castle.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nSoon after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the castle ended its history as a residence of the ruling nobility.  The O-shita-no-yashiki Residence was then used as the government center of Fukuoka Prefecture, a new regional administrative unit which adopted the name of the castle.  In Meiji 9 (1876) the government centre was moved to the southeastern area of what was once the outer castle of Fukuoka Castle, and the castle was then used as a military complex up until 1945, when the Pacific War ended, and the site began to be used by U.S. American occupation forces.\nWhen the site of the inner castle was designated a national historical site in 1957, most of the castle structures in the inner castle had in the meanwhile decayed, been demolished, or burnt down, except for the following seven structures, which survive up to the present time:\n\nTamon Yagura (Minami-no-maru Nishi-hira Yagura)\u2014Located atop the western wall of the Minami-no-maru.\nShimo-no-hashi Gate\u2014The second floor of the structure was removed.\n(Go-) Hon-maru Omote-(go-)mon (main gate of the hon-maru)\u2014Located to the north of the hon-maru; moved to Sofuku-ji Temple.\nHanami Yagura (Cherry-blossom-viewing Yagura)\u2014Located in the southwestern corner of the inner castle; moved to Sofuku-ji Temple, but being returned to its original location.\nShiomi Yagura (Sea-water-viewing Yagura)\u2014Located in the northwestern corner of the inner castle; moved to Sofuku-ji Temple, but being returned to its original location. (This structure has long been believed to be the Tsukimi Yagura.)\nKinen Yagura (Prayer Yagura)\u2014Located on the northeastern corner of the hon-maru; Moved to Taish\u014d-ji Temple in the present-day city of Kitakyushu and returned to its original location. (The aftermath of this structure is not quite certain, because the exterior of the structure and some documents, including an old photograph, contradict each other.)\nInosuke Yagura or Ko-tokiuchi Yagura (Former Clock Yagura)\u2014Located on the western wall of the hon-maru; moved to the Kuroda family's detached residence located to the north of the inner castle, then to the Shimo-no-hashi Gateway. (This structure has long been believed to be the Shiomi Yagura.)The stone walls in the inner castle, however, are fairly well preserved, except for the following:\n\nThe stone wall to the south of the Higashi-Ni-no-maru.\nThe stone walls around the Matsunoki-zaka Gateway.\nThe stone walls around the Oimawashi Gateway.\nSome parts of the revetment on both sides of the moats.The mound lines are also well preserved today, although many parts of the moats have been reclaimed.\nThe inner castle site is now used as Maizuru (Dancing Crane) Park and Ohori Park, places of recreation and relaxation for the Fukuokan public.  These parks include an athletic stadium, other sports facilities, flower gardens, Fukuoka City Museum of Art, Fukuoka District and High Courts, and Jonai residential quarter.\nAs for the outer castle, almost all the stone walls, mound lines and structures were demolished soon after the Meiji Restoration.  The Hizen Moat and the Naka Moat were reclaimed and the Tojin-machiji-guchi Moat was converted into a culvert.  However, a portion of the stone walls to the south of the Higashi-toriire Gate and an upper portion of the northern stone walls (bulwark) of the battery adjacent to the estuary of the Naka River can still be seen today.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBenesch, Oleg and Ran Zwigenberg (2019).

        "wiki": "The Japanese rock garden (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34, karesansui) or \"dry landscape\" garden, often called a zen garden, creates a miniature stylized landscape through carefully composed arrangements of rocks, water features, moss, pruned trees and bushes, and uses gravel or sand that is raked to represent ripples in water. A zen garden is usually relatively small,  surrounded by a wall, and is usually meant to be seen while seated from a single viewpoint outside the garden, such as the porch of the hojo, the residence of the chief monk of the temple or monastery. Classical zen gardens were created at temples of Zen Buddhism in Kyoto during the Muromachi period. They were intended to imitate the intimate essence of nature, not its actual appearance, and to serve as an aid to meditation about the true meaning of existence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early Japanese rock gardens ===\nStone gardens existed in Japan at least since the Heian period (794\u20131185). These early gardens were described in the first manual of Japanese gardens, Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Keeping\"), written at the end of the 11th century by Tachibana no Toshitsuna (1028\u20131094). They were largely copied from the Chinese gardens of the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), where groups of rocks symbolized Mount Penglai, the legendary mountain-island home of the Eight Immortals in Chinese mythology, known in Japanese as Horai. The Sakuteiki described exactly how rocks should be placed.  In one passage, he wrote:\n\"In a place where there is neither a lake or a stream, one can put in place what is called a kare-sansui, or dry landscape\". This kind of garden featured either rocks placed upright like mountains, or laid out in a miniature landscape of hills and ravines, with few plants. He described several other styles of rock garden, which usually included a stream or pond,  including the great river style, the mountain river style, and the marsh style. The ocean style featured rocks that appeared to have been eroded by waves, surrounded by a bank of white sand, like a beach.White sand and gravel had long been a feature of Japanese gardens. In the Shinto religion, it was used to symbolize purity, and was used around shrines, temples, and palaces. In zen gardens, it represents water, or, like the white space in Japanese paintings, emptiness and distance. They are places of meditation.\n\n\n=== Zen Buddhism and the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573) ===\nThe Muromachi period in Japan, which took place at roughly the same time as the Renaissance in Europe, was characterized by political rivalries which frequently led to wars, but also by an extraordinary flourishing of Japanese culture. It saw the beginning of Noh theater, the Japanese tea ceremony, the shoin style of Japanese architecture, and the zen garden.Zen Buddhism was introduced into Japan at the end of the 12th century, and quickly achieved a wide following, particularly among the Samurai class and war lords, who admired its doctrine of self-discipline. The gardens of the early zen temples in Japan resembled Chinese gardens of the time, with lakes and islands. But in Kyoto in the 14th and 15th century, a new kind of garden appeared at the important zen temples. These zen gardens were designed to stimulate meditation. \"Nature, if you made it expressive by reducing it to its abstract forms, could transmit the most profound thoughts by its simple presence\", Michel Baridon wrote. \"The compositions of stone, already common in China, became in Japan, veritable petrified landscapes, which seemed suspended in time, as in certain moments of Noh theater, which dates to the same period.\"The first garden to begin the transition to the new style is considered by many experts to be Saih\u014d-ji, \"The Temple of the Perfumes of the West,\" popularly known as Koke-dera, the Moss Garden, in the western part of Kyoto. The Buddhist monk and zen master Mus\u014d Kokushi transformed a Buddhist temple into a zen monastery in 1334, and built the gardens. The lower garden of Saih\u014d-ji is in the traditional Heian period style; a pond with several rock compositions representing islands. The upper garden is a dry rock garden which features three rock \"islands\". The first, called Kameshima, the island of the turtle, resembles a turtle swimming in a \"lake\" of moss. The second, Zazen-seki, is a flat \"meditation rock,\" which is believed to radiate calm and silence;  and the third is the kare-taki, a dry \"waterfall\" composed of a stairway of flat granite rocks. The moss which now surrounds the rocks and represents water, was not part of the original garden plan;  it grew several centuries later when the garden was left untended,  but now is the most famous feature of the garden.Muso Kokushi built another temple garden at Tenry\u016b-ji, the \"Temple of the Celestial Dragon\". This garden appears to have been strongly influenced by Chinese landscape painting of the Song Dynasty, which feature mountains rising in the mist, and a suggestion of great depth and height. The garden at Tenry\u016b-ji has a real pond with water and a dry waterfall of rocks looking like a Chinese landscape. Saih\u014d-ji and Tenry\u016b-ji show the transition from the Heian style garden toward a more abstract and stylized view of nature.The gardens of Ginkaku-ji, also known as the Silver Pavilion, are also attributed to Muso Kokushi. This temple garden included a traditional pond garden, but it had a new feature for a Japanese garden; an area of raked white gravel with a perfectly shaped mountain of white gravel, resembling Mount Fuji, in the center. The scene was called  ginshanada, literally \"sand of silver and open sea\". This garden feature became  known as kogetsudai, or small mountain facing the moon,\" and similar small Mount Fuji made of sand or earth covered with grass appeared in Japanese gardens for centuries afterwards.The most famous of all zen gardens in Kyoto is Ry\u014dan-ji, built in the late 15th century where for the first time the zen garden became purely abstract. The garden is a rectangle of 340 square meters. Placed within it are fifteen stones of different sizes, carefully composed in five groups; one group of five stones, two groups of three, and two groups of two stones. The stones are surrounded by white gravel, which is carefully raked each day by the monks. The only vegetation in the garden is some moss around the stones. The garden is meant to be viewed from a seated position on the veranda of the h\u014dj\u014d, the residence of the abbot of the monastery.The garden at Daisen-in (1509\u20131513) took a more literary approach than Ry\u014dan-ji. There a \"river\" of white gravel represents a metaphorical journey through life; beginning with a dry waterfall in the mountains, passing through rapids and rocks, and ending in a tranquil sea of white gravel, with two gravel mountains.\nThe invention of the zen garden was closely connected with developments in Japanese ink landscape paintings. Japanese painters such as Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d (1420\u20131506) and Soami (died 1525) greatly simplified their views of nature, showing  only the most essential aspects of nature, leaving great areas of white around the black and gray drawings. Soami is said to have been personally involved in the design of two of the most famous zen gardens in Kyoto, Ry\u014dan-ji and Daisen-in, though his involvement has never been documented with certainty.\nMichel Baridon wrote, \"The famous zen gardens of the Muromachi period showed that Japan had carried the art of gardens to the highest degree of intellectual refinement that it was possible to attain.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Later rock gardens ===\nDuring the Edo period, the large promenade garden became the dominant style of Japanese garden, but zen gardens continued to exist at zen temples. A few small new rock gardens were built, usually as part of a garden where a real stream or pond was not practical.\nIn 1880, the buildings of T\u014dfuku-ji temple in Kyoto, one of the oldest temples in the city, were destroyed by a fire. In 1940, the temple commissioned the landscape historian and architect Shigemori Mirei to recreate the gardens. He created four different gardens, one for each face of the main temple building. He made one garden with five artificial hills covered with grass, symbolizing the five great ancient temples of Kyoto; a modern rock garden, with vertical rocks, symbolizing Mount Horai; a large \"sea\" of white gravel raked in a checkboard pattern; and an intimate garden with swirling sand patterns.In the last century, zen gardens have appeared in many countries outside Japan.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Selection and arrangement of rocks ==\nThe selection and placement of rocks is the most important part of making a Japanese rock garden. In the first known manual of Japanese gardening, the Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\"), is expressed as \"setting stones\", ishi wo tateru koto; literally, the \"act of setting stones upright.\" It laid out very specific rules for choice and the placement of stones, and warned that if the rules were not followed the owner of the garden would suffer misfortune. In Japanese gardening, rocks are classified as either tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat.For creating \"mountains\", usually igneous volcanic rocks, rugged mountain rocks with sharp edges, are used. Smooth, rounded sedimentary rocks are used for the borders of gravel \"rivers\" or \"seashores.\" In Chinese gardens of the Song dynasty, individual rocks which looked like animals or had other unusual features were often the star attraction of the garden. In Japanese gardens, individual rocks rarely play the starring role; the emphasis is upon the harmony of the composition. For arranging rocks, there are many rules in the Sakuteiki, for example:\n\nMake sure that all the stones, right down to the front of the arrangement, are placed with their best sides showing. If a stone has an ugly-looking top you should place it so as to give prominence to its side. Even if this means it has to lean at a considerable angle, no one will notice. There should always be more horizontal than vertical stones. If there are \"running away\" stones there must be \"chasing\" stones. If there are \"leaning\" stones, there must be \"supporting\" stones.\n\nRocks are rarely if ever placed in straight lines or in symmetrical patterns. The most common arrangement is one or more groups of three rocks. One common triad arrangement has a tall vertical rock flanked by two smaller rocks, representing Buddha and his two attendants. Other basic combinations are a tall vertical rock with a reclining rock; a short vertical rock and a flat rock; and a triad of a tall vertical rock, a reclining rock and a flat rock. Other important principles are to choose rocks which vary in color, shape and size, to avoid rocks with bright colors which might distract the viewer, and make certain that the grains of rocks run in the same direction.\nAt the end of the Edo period, a new principle was invented: the use of suteishi, \"discarded\" or \"nameless\" rocks, placed in seemingly random places to add spontaneity to the garden. Other important principles of rock arrangement include balancing the number of vertical and horizontal rocks.\n\n\n== Sand and gravel ==\nGravel is usually used in zen gardens, rather than sand, because it is less disturbed by rain and wind. The act of raking the gravel into a pattern recalling waves or rippling water, known as samon (\u7802\u7d0b) or h\u014dkime (\u7b92\u76ee), has an aesthetic function. Zen priests practice this raking also to help their concentration. Achieving perfection of lines is not easy. Rakes are according to the patterns of ridges as desired and limited to some of the stone objects situated within the gravel area. Nonetheless, often the patterns are not static. Developing variations in patterns is a creative and inspiring challenge.\nStone arrangements and other miniature elements are used to represent mountains and natural water elements and scenes, islands, rivers and waterfalls. Stone and shaped shrubs (karikomi, hako-zukuri topiary) are used interchangeably. In most gardens moss is used as a ground cover to create \"land\" covered by forest.\nShirakawa, which is a black-speckled granite from Kyoto, Japan, was prized for its ability to hold raked grooves and was previously used in Oregon's Japanese Garden. The source of Shirakawa is now a protected waterway, making it illegal to harvest Shirakawa. Oregon's Japanese Garden has subsequently been forced to look for alternative sources of gravel with similar properties, and has experimented with granite chips from Canadian quarries.\n\n\n== Symbolism ==\nIn the Japanese rock garden, rocks sometimes symbolize mountains (particularly Horai, the legendary home of the Eight Immortals in Buddhist mythology); or they can be boats or a living creature (usually a turtle, or a carp). In a group, they might be a waterfall or a crane in flight.\nIn the earliest rock gardens of the Heian period, the rocks in a garden sometimes had a political message. As the Sakutei-ki wrote:\n\nSometimes, when mountains are weak, they are without fail destroyed by water. It is, in other words, as if subjects had attacked their emperor. A mountain is weak if it does not have stones for support. An emperor is weak if he does not have counselors. That is why it is said that it is because of stones that a mountain is sure, and thanks to his subjects that an emperor is secure. It is for this reason that, when you construct a landscape, you must at all cost place rocks around the mountain.\n\nSome classical zen gardens, like Daisen-in, have symbolism that can be easily read; it is a metaphorical journey on the river of life. Others, like Ry\u014dan-ji, resist easy interpretation. Many different theories have been put forward about what the garden is supposed to represent, from islands in a stream to swimming baby tigers to the peaks of mountains rising above the clouds to theories about secrets of geometry or of the rules of equilibrium of odd numbers. Garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote: \"The garden at Ry\u014dan-ji does not symbolize anything, or more precisely, to avoid any misunderstanding, the garden of Ry\u014dan-ji does not symbolize, nor does it have the value of reproducing a natural beauty that one can find in the real or mythical world. I consider it to be an abstract composition of \"natural\" objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite meditation.\"A recent suggestion by Gert van Tonder of Kyoto University and Michael Lyons of Ritsumeikan University is that the rocks of Ry\u014dan-ji form the subliminal image of a tree. The researchers claim the subconscious mind is sensitive to a subtle association between the rocks. They suggest this may be responsible for the calming effect of the garden.\n\n\n== Landscape painting and the Zen garden critique ==\nChinese landscape painting was one of the many Chinese arts that came to Japan with Zen Buddhism in the fourteenth century. That the Buddhism of Zen influenced garden design was first suggested not in Japan, but in the West by a Hawaiian garden journalist Loraine Kuck in the 1930s and disputed as such by a scholar of Japanese garden history, Wybe Kuitert in 1988. This was well before scholars jumped on the bandwagon in the 1990s to deconstruct the promotion and reception of Zen. The critique comes down to the fact that Buddhist priests were not trying to express Zen in gardens. A review of the quotes of Buddhist priests that are taken to \"prove\" Zen for the garden are actually phrases copied from Chinese treatises on landscape painting. Secondary writers on the Japanese garden like Keane and Nitschke, who were associating with Kuitert when he was working on his research at the Kyoto University joined the Zen garden critique, like Kendall H. Brown, who took a similar distance from the Zen garden. In Japan the critique was taken over by Yamada Shouji who took a critical stance to the understanding of all Japanese culture, including gardens, under the nominator of Zen. Christian Tagsold summarized the discussion by placing perceptions of the Japanese garden in the context of an interdisciplinary comparison of cultures of Japan and the West.Zen priests quote from Chinese treatises on landscape painting indicating that the Japanese rock garden, and its karesansui garden scenery was and still is inspired by or based on first Chinese and later also Japanese landscape painting. Landscape painting and landscape gardening were closely related and practiced by intellectuals, the literati inspired by Chinese culture. A primary design principle was the creation of a landscape based on, or at least greatly influenced by, the three-dimensional monochrome ink (sumi) landscape painting, sumi-e or suiboku-ga. In Japan the garden has the same status as a work of art. Though each garden is different in its composition, they mostly use rock groupings and shrubs to represent a classic scene of mountains, valleys and waterfalls taken from Chinese landscape painting. In some cases it might be as abstract as just a few islands in a sea. Any Japanese garden may also incorporates existing scenery outside its confinement, e.g. the hills behind, as \"borrowed scenery\" (using a technique called Shakkei).\n\n\n== List of shrines and temples with rock gardens ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAdelaide Himeji Garden - Sea of Sand\nJapanese garden\nList of garden types\nHigashiyama Bunka in Muromachi period\nRock garden\nWabi-sabi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWybe Kuitert (1988).

At the same time the Hii (Tajima) River, which was flowing into the cove, was diverted from its course to the west.\nThe present park was reconstructed by Fukuoka City, modeled on the West Lake of China, and opened in 1929. A fireworks festival is held here every August. \nThe Fukuoka Art Museum and the United States Consulate are nearby.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\u014chorik\u014den Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)\nOhori Park - Yokanavi.com\nFukuoka Travel:Ohori Park - Japan-guide.com",

          "This city is very important to Ancient Japan. In fact, it is one of the oldest kingdoms before Japan united. They had the first contact with China. The whole history of Fukuoka (formerly called Hakata) is there including about the invasion of Khan's army and how it was first",
          "A nice museum close to Fukuoka tower. Worth taking a look inside if you already are in the area. The permanent exhibition is nice.",
          "I spent about 3 hours here and it was great. Each Japanese time period is covered from Jomon to the present. Only thing I didn't like was, \"no photos\", and limited English information. I think there is English audio but didn't know this until I was leaving.",
          "The museum was a bit out of the way for me, but well worth the time and effort to get there. The building appears disappointing, a misguided design from the 1970s or 1980s, but what truly matters is the exhibits. The exhibits and textual descriptions highlight the importance of",
          "Definitely worthwhile for the Fukuoka-Hakata historical context. Many fascinating exhibits from pre-history to modern times. If you like to enhance your vacations with more background information, you will really enjoy this museum. Renting the audio is a must for non-Japanese",
          "Ticket at 200 yen (~S $2.50) : For normal exhibition. Spent an hour in the museum. A very brief history of Fukuoka and the golden seal. Personally, I felt that the museum is a bit not very English friendly. Additional 300 yen for English audio guide.",
          "The Fukuoka City Museum opened its doors in 1990. It was built during the economic bubble in Japan (1986 to 1991) at a vast land reclamation called Momochi-hama (Momochi-Beach). So it has very spacious surroundings documenting the high spirits of those years. As present-day",
          "The airport is very close to the city center! Take the subway! Bus or taxi! International flight even possible to go to European countries via south route or even others destination",
          "If you still have time after having visited all the major shrines, and on a rainy day (where a visit to gardens would not be recommended), this museum would be a good Plan D or E. It provides an interesting account of Fukuoka's history. Located about 30 minutes from central",

          "If you are in Fukuoka, even for a short time (as I was), this Museum is a very good place to visit in order to know something about the city's history. The visit doesn't take long and the museum is fairly near the center of the city.",

          "We visited here after Fukuoka Tower. This is a great little museum with plenty to see. I was truly amazed by the history displayed here dating back some 26,000 years. It took us about an hour and a half but that was mainly because there was not a lot of signage in English. There",

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters. It was closed on September 2009. The surrounding shopping center, Marinoa City Fukuoka, still attracts millions of visitors each year. Other shopping centers that attract tourists include Canal City, JR Hakata City, and Hakata Riverain.Fukuoka Castle, located adjacent to Ohori Park in Maizuru Park, features the remaining stone walls and ramparts left after a devastating fire during the upheaval of the Meiji Restoration. It has now been preserved along with some reconstructed prefabricate concrete towers constructed during the 1950s and 1960s, when there was a trend across Japan to rebuild damaged castles as tourist attractions. \u014chori Park is also the location of one of Fukuoka City's major art galleries.\nThere are many temples with long histories including T\u014dch\u014d-ji, Hakozaki Shrine, Kashii shrine, and J\u014dten-ji.\nThe Marine Park Uminonakamichi is located on a narrow cape on the northern side of the Bay of Hakata. The park has an amusement park, petting zoo, gardens, beaches, a hotel, and a large marine aquarium which opened in 1989.For tourists from other parts of Japan, local foods such as mentaiko, Hakata ramen and motsunabe are associated with Fukuoka. Yatai (street stalls) serving ramen can be found in Tenjin and Nakasu most evenings.\nFukuoka Tower is near the beach in Seaside Momochi, a development built for the 1989 Asia-Pacific Exhibition. The older symbol of the city, Hakata Port Tower is next to the international ferry terminal and is free to enter.\nItoshima, to the west of Fukuoka city, has recently become a very popular tourist destination.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals. The costumes are worn with pride and are considered appropriate wear for even formal occasions, such as weddings and cocktail parties, during the festival.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Hakata Dontaku ====\nHakata Dontaku (\u535a\u591a\u3069\u3093\u305f\u304f) is held in Fukuoka City on May 3 and 4.

During the festival, stages are erected throughout downtown for traditional performances and a parade of floats is held. The full name is Hakata Dontaku Minato Matsuri.The festival was stopped for seven years during the Meiji era. Since it was restarted in the 12th year of the Meiji era it has been known as Hakata Dontaku.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNotable musical names in J-pop include Ayumi Hamasaki (allegedly Japan's richest woman), singer-songwriter Ringo Shiina, hugely popular singer-songwriter duo Chage & Aska, singer-songwriter Eri Nobuchika, Misia, Masamune Kusano and Yui. During the 1970s, local musicians prided themselves on their origins and dubbed their sound, Mentai Rock.\nMorning Musume 6th generation member Reina Tanaka was also born here in 1989 along with 9th generation member Erina Ikuta in 1997.\nDominican songwriter and singer Juan Luis Guerra pays homage to the city in his bachata song Bachata en Fukuoka (2010).\nHKT 48 have their own Theater at Nishitetsu Hall.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFukuoka is served by Fukuoka Airport, the San'y\u014d Shinkansen and the Kyushu Shinkansen high-speed rail line and other JR Kyushu trains at Hakata Station and by ferry.

        "wiki": "Hakata-ku (\u535a\u591a\u533a) is a ward of the city of Fukuoka in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.\nMany of Fukuoka Prefecture and Fukuoka City's principal government, commercial, retail and entertainment establishments are located in the district. Hakata-ku is also the location of Fukuoka's main train station, Hakata Station, Fukuoka Airport and the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakata-ku is a ward of Fukuoka City located on its eastern edge. It is 31.47 km2 with a population of 206,629 (current January 1, 2009). Much of the ward consists of low-lying plains beside the Mikasa River (\u5fa1\u7b20\u5ddd, Mikasagawa). The northwestern end of the ward faces Hakata Bay, which includes both ferry and international cruise ship terminals Hakata Harbor (\u535a\u591a\u6e2f, Hakata k\u014d). The northeast end of the ward is slightly elevated, and is named Higashihirao (\u6771\u5e73\u5c3e), with nearby Fukuoka Airport. Around Hakata Station is downtown; Nakasu (\u4e2d\u6d32) is the main dining and entertainment district of the ward along the Naka River (\u90a3\u73c2\u5ddd, Nakagawa). Hakata-ku also houses the Fukuoka Prefectural office.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nMany Japanese companies have established branch offices in Hakata-ku due to its ease of access to local government offices as well transportation hubs such as Hakata Station and Fukuoka Airport. The headquarters of JR Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Best Denki, and many other companies are in the ward.Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered on the grounds of Fukuoka Airport in Hakata-ku. Link Airs has its headquarters in the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building (\u798f\u5ca1\u7947\u5712\u7b2c\u4e00\u751f\u547d\u30d3\u30eb Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Biru) in Hakata-ku. Cisco has an Asia-Pacific sales office on the 12th floor of the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building.Prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was headquartered on the grounds of the airport in Hakata-ku.Hakata's economy was significantly transformed in 1996 with the opening of Canal City Hakata, an award-winning destination shopping and entertainment center.\n\n\n=== Cruise ship tourism ===\nFrom the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China.\nIn 2014, 91 cruise ships travelled from China called at Hakata. In 2015, 245 cruise ship calls were made at Hakata Port. After expansion and redevelopment of the port facilities, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400. As of 2015, the largest passenger vessel making regular port calls at Hakata is the Royal Caribbean International owned MS Quantum of the Seas.\nPartly as a result of growing international tourism, in 2015 Fukuoka reported the fastest rising tax revenues and population in Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nHakata is one of the oldest cities in Japan. In the Middle Ages Hakata, which faces onto the Genkai-Nada Channel (\u7384\u754c\u7058) dividing Japan from Korea, was a base for merchants who traded with China and Korea, and the city housed Japan's first Chinatown. Taira no Kiyomori is said to have built the artificial harbor Sode-no-minato (\u8896\u306e\u6e4a) to increase commerce. Hakata was burned down by many wars, including the Mongol invasions.\n\nIn the early Edo period, Kuroda Nagamasa, appointed the lord of Chikuzen Province, and most of his samurai vassals lived in Fukusaki, on the opposite shore of the Naka River from Hakata. Kuroda Nagamasa changed the name of the area to Fukuoka after his home town; Fukuoka in Okayama Prefecture. He ordered Tachibana Castle and Najima Castle dismantled, and had Fukuoka Castle built using the stones from those older castles. At that time Hakata was no larger than one square kilometer, demarcated by defensive lines along the Naka River, the Boshu-bori (or Boshu Canal), and the Ishido or Mikasa River.\nIn 1876, Hakata, then also known as Dai-Ni-Dai-ku, and Fukuoka, or Dai-Ichi-Dai-ku, were merged. In 1878 the settlement was renamed Fukuoka-ku (\u798f\u5ca1\u533a) by the Fukuoka prefectural government, though the population of Hakata was 25,677 and that of Fukuoka was 20,410. At that time, the name Hakata vanished from the administration. In 1889, after a local referendum in which half the voters chose the name Fukuoka and half chose Hakata, the city was officially renamed Fukuoka-shi, but at the same time a new train station then being built was named Hakata Station.\nAn imperial decree issued in July 1899 established Hakata as an open port for trade with the United States and the United Kingdom.In 1972, when Fukuoka City was granted designated status by government ordinance, a ward including the old Hakata area was given the name Hakata-ku.\nIn 2016 a large sinkhole appeared in the city center just west of Hakata station. The sinkhole was filled and the affected roads were completely repaired within a few days, in what some called a testament to Japanese ingenuity. However, the hasty repair seems to have been problematic as less than a month later the road began showing signs of imminent implosion.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nHakata was the traditional center for the manufacture of Hakata ningy\u014d, which are traditional Japanese dolls that are famous throughout Japan. Today, almost all Hakata ningy\u014d makers (Hakata ningy\u014d shi) have their factories out of the Old Hakata Area, a part of modern Hakata-ku.\nHakata-ori is a textile used for obis of kimonos.It is also the home of Mentai Rock, named after the popular mentaiko dish served in the region, that spawned numerous J-pop idols during the early 1980s. Neo Mentai Rock is the name given to a recent renewal in activity from local musicians.\nHakata-ben is the local Japanese dialect spoken in the Old Hakata Area.\nHakata is also the location of the pop group HKT48.\nAnouther popular group from Hakata are Kanikapila\nParts of the famous crime novel 'Points and lines' ('Ten to Sen' in Japanese) by the award-winning Japanese writer Seich\u014d Matsumoto occur in Hakata and its train station.\n\n\n=== Famous foods ===\nMentaiko\nTonkotsu (pork bone) ramen, also called simply Hakata ramen\nMotsunabe\nJapanese cheesecake\nMizutaki - Nabemono of chicken\nHakata Torimon (ja:\u535a\u591a\u901a\u308a\u3082\u3093) - a type of cake\nHakata no Hito - a type of cake\nTsukemen (dipping noodles)\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nHakata Dontaku Minato Matsuri - May 3 and 4\nHakata Gion Yamakasa - from July 1 to 15\nHakata O-kunchi - October 23 and 24 (prior to 1953, November 23)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nJR West\nSany\u014d Shinkansen\nHakata Station\nJR Ky\u016bsh\u016b\nKy\u016bsh\u016b Shinkansen\nHakata Station\nKagoshima Main Line\nYoshizuka Station - Hakata Station - Takeshita Station - Minami-Fukuoka Station\nSasaguri Line\nYoshizuka Station\nNishi-Nippon Railroad\nTenjin \u014cmuta Line\nZasshonokuma Station\nFukuoka City Subway\nK\u016bk\u014d Line\nNakasu-Kawabata Station - Gion Station - Hakata Station - Higashi-Hie Station - Fukuokak\u016bk\u014d Station(Fukuoka Airport)\nHakozaki Line\nNakasu-Kawabata Station - Gofukumachi Station - Chiyo-Kench\u014dguchi Station\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nHakata bus terminus (see Nishitetsu)\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nFukuoka Airport\n\n\n=== Harbor ===\nBayside place Hakata Futoh (Hakata Pier)\nCh\u016b\u014d Wharf (Central Wharf) - international ferry Beetle and Kobee and New Camellia\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Commerce ===\nCanal City Hakata\nGrand Hyatt Fukuoka\nHakata Riverain\nHakata-za\nHotel \u014ckura Fukuoka\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nLevel-5 stadium (Hakata no mori Stadium)\nFukuoka Convention Center - Marine Messe Fukuoka, Fukuoka International Congress Center, Fukuoka Kokusai Center\nHakata Civic Center, Hakata Library\nHakata South Library\nNakasu\nRakusui-en\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nShinto\nKushida Shrine\nSumiyoshi Shrine\nT\u014dka Ebisu Shrine\nBuddhism\nSh\u014dfuku Temple\nT\u014dch\u014d Temple\nJ\u014dten Temple\nS\u014dfuku Temple\nChristianity\nFukuoka Korean Christian Church, Chiyo\nHakata New Life Church,\nHikarigaoka (Hill of light) Catholic Church [1]\nMinoshima Catholic Pastoral Center.\nJapan Evangelical Lutheran church, Sasaki machi\nJapan Baptist Church, Aoki\nNorth Kyushu Japanese Orthodox Church, Higashi-hirao\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe South Korean government maintains the Korea Education Institution (Korean: \ud6c4\ucfe0\uc624\uce74 \ud55c\uad6d\uad50\uc721\uc6d0; Japanese: \u798f\u5ca1\u97d3\u56fd\u6559\u80b2\u9662) in Hakata-ku.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It was founded by Enni-Ben'en with support from Xie Guo Ming, a Chinese merchant, and construction was completed in 1242.\n\n\n== Monument to the introduction of udon and soba ==\n\nThe founding priest of the temple, Enni-Ben'en went to China in 1235, mastered Zen Buddhism through a great hardship and came back to Japan in 1241.

        "wiki": "Hakata-ori (\u535a\u591a\u7e54) is a traditional Japanese textile produced in Fukuoka Prefecture with a history of more than 770 years. The history began in 1235 (Song Dynasty period, China), a Japanese merchant from Fukuoka prefecture, Mitsuda Yazaemon traveled to China with the buddhist monk, Shoichi Kokushi. Six years later (1241), they returned to Japan and brought along the technique of producing a textile, which became the origin of Hakata-Ori. 250 years later, Mitsuda Yazaemon\u2019s descendant returned to China (Ming Dynasty period, China) to learn more about production in depth and has been developing the technique, which later become the name Hakata-Ori. The name is a combination of the originated region (Hakata, Japan) and the word \"Ori\" (weaving). There are two types of Hakata-ori: kenjo hakata-ori and mon ori hakata-ori. Kenjo Hakata-orii is a traditional pattern, represents the idea related to Buddhism beliefs and got influenced by Sui Dynasty period, China. Mon ori hakata-ori is a name for the Hakata-ori that contains multi-colored designs. Hakata-ori is most used as Obi which both men and women can wear. As the western culture is spreading, Hakata-ori now produced in many forms of products. For example, handbag, neck tie, scarf, and wedding dress.\n\n\n== History ==\nHakata-ori traces its origin to 1235. A Japanese merchant, Mitsuda Yazaemon from Fukuoka Prefecture and the buddhist monk, Shoichi Kokushi traveled to Song dynasty China to learn the Song's traditions such as making manju (Japanese cake), ceramic skills, gold leaf, musk tablets, wheat noodles, and producing textiles. Six years later, they brought along the technique back to Japan in 1241 during Kamakura period (1185 - 1333), and Mitsuda Yazaemon began his textiles business. 250 years later in the 16th century, Mitsuda Yazaemon's descendant, Mitsuda Hikosaburo returned to China to study more about making the textiles during Ming Dynasty period, China. Mitsuda Hikosaburo used the new technique that he learned from Ming Dynasty period and then combined it with the previous technique, which was from Song Dynasty period to master the weaving technique. The improved design is called \"Fusenmon\" and \"Ryujo\", which is taffeta-like material that has raised stripe. After that, they have been developing the weaving technique until it becomes Hakata-ori textile that we see today. The name Hakata-ori came from the name of the originated and developed region (Hakata, Fukuoka prefecture, Japan) and the word \"Ori\" which means weaving. It is also the origin of Hakata Obi.There are two types of Hakata-ori: kenjo Hakata-ori and mon ori Hakata-ori. Kenjo Hakata-ori is used to call textile that contains continuous stripe and represent the idea of \"Dokko\" (metal tool which abandon the mundane desires) and \"Hanazara\" (vessel for scattering flower and a plate that is used to burn incense). Both of them are Buddhist tool that express the spirit of Buddhist monk and carry the memorial services for Buddha. For this type of Hakata-ori, it is fixed to use only five colors in order to follow the system of Sui Dynasty period, China, where each colors has it owns meaning. Mon ori Hakata-ori is a common name that used to call hakata-ori textiles that has multi-colored designs.\n\nIn 1600s, during Edo period (1603 - 1868 Japan), the feudal lord of Fukuoka clan (Chikuzen Province), Nagamasa Kuroda had chosen Hakata-Ori textiles and presented it to Tokugawa shogunate, Lemon Takewaka as tribute. In fact, the word \"Kenjo-gara\" (from Kenjo Hakata-Ori) which means offering pattern came from this action.In 1815 during Edo period, the textile became popular when the Kabuki actor wore an obi made from Hakata-Ori and stood on stage. The original use for hakata-ori is an obi made mostly for men who wear kimono or yukata. Once the fabric made from hakata-ori is tightened, it is hard to loosen. Therefore, it was wore a lot by Samurai who needs to tuck their katana (sword) into kimono. However, during Meiji period, it slowly changed to an obi made for women.Nowadays, as the western culture is spreading, hakata-ori now converting to many forms of products not just an obi, such as handbags, phone straps, necktie, card holders, book cover, beach sandals, scarf, coin pouch, wedding dress.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nOne characteristic of hakata-ori is that once the fabric is tightened, it is hard to loosen. The textile is made from thick material and by twisting the thin warps and thick wefts in many yarns together. After that, the reed is used to make a horizontal bump. By carrying the warps to the surface, the pattern is fabricated. There are two types of hakata-ori: kenjo hakata-ori and mon ori hakata-ori.\n\n\n=== Kenjo hakata-ori (present) ===\nKenjo hakata-ori is a traditional pattern. It is used to call the textiles that has a continuous stripe and represent the idea of \"Dokko\" and \"Hanazara\". \"Dokko\" is an iron club and also an instrument. \"Hanazara\" is a plate that is used to burn incense. Both \"Dokko\" and \"Hanazara\" are related to Buddhism beliefs. In 1600s, the first lord of Chikuzen Fukuoka clan, Nagamasa Kuroda, protected the production of hakata-ori and presented it to the Tokugawa shogunate, which became the word \"Kenjo-gara\" that means \"offering pattern\". For this type of hakata-ori, only five colors are using to follow the system taken from Sui Dynasty period, China. Each colors has their own meaning. For instance, purple is a noble color refers to virtue, elegant, and mystery. Red means courtesy, happiness, and prosperity. Yellow means sincerity, trust, and other people except for the emperor cannot use this color. Blue means honor, calmness, peace. Navy Blue (Dark Blue) means wisdom and solidity.\n\n\n=== Mon ori hakata-ori (woven design) ===\nMon ori hakata-ori is a common name for the textile that contains multi-colored designs. This type of hakata-ori has been woven since 1603 - 1868 (Edo period, Japan) and still developing after the importation of Jacquard weaving machine in 1885. Although using the machine for weaving hakata-ori is primary, the workers who specialize in knowledge and skill are still necessary in order to check the patterns and threads of hakata-ori in the production process.\n\n\n== Production processes ==\nHakata-ori's production processes are including four steps: Design, Dyeing, Preparation for weaving, and weaving. Designing is the first process of making hakata-ori. The specialists will think of a pattern and the uses of color in the textile that they want to make. They first draw it on the plotting paper. This process is called \"Isho\" in Japanese. The second process is Dyeing. After selecting the color that will be used, first the raw silk will get washed up by soapy water to clean out luster. Then, the wefts and warps are put in boiling water mixing with chemical dyes or plant dyes. This process requires specialist because the color is sensitive to weather, and the process is called \"Ito Kui\". The third process is Preparation for weaving. The warps are put through the hooks in Jacquard loom, which can move the warps in up and down direction by using feet. This process is called \"Hatajikake\" in Japanese. The last process is the Weaving. By twisting the thin warps and thick wefts in many yarns together, the reed is used to make a horizontal bump next. The pattern of the textile is showing by carrying the warps to the surface and becomes hakata-ori in the final process. The technique is called \u201cuchikaeshi mitsuuchi\u201d in Japanese.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe most common use of hakata-ori is for Obi that can be used by both men and women who wear kimono and yukata. In the past, it is used by Samurai who had to tuck their katana (sword) into their kimono since the fabric is durable and hold tight to the body. In the beginning, Obi made from hakata-ori was mostly for men to use. However, in the middle of Meiji period, Japan, Obi made from hakata-ori had changed to be used more by women.As for the spreading of the western culture, hakata-ori now producing in many forms of products. For example, handbags, phone straps, necktie, card holders, book cover, beach sandals, scarf, coin pouch, wedding dress.\n\n\n== Trademark ==\nThe trademark \"\u535a\u591a\u7e54\" (hakata-ori) belongs to Hakataori Industrial Association. Their trademark is registered on March 9, 2017 with the registration number 5031531. The registered trademark is \"\u535a\u591a\u7e54\" (hakata-ori). The specify products are silk textile and Japanese cloths that made in Fukuoka city and other 21 cities which used the technique originated in Hakata area, Fukuoka prefecture. Although Sec. 3(1)(iii) of Trade Mark Act says that the collective trademark cannot be registered as long as it contains regional name or product name, if it becomes \"particularly distinctive\", the problem that there is regional name on the trademark can be an exception under Sec. 3(2) of Trade Mark Act. If not, in order to get the collective trademark, it needs to satisfy the Sec. 7bis(1) of Trade Mark Act instead.The difference between Sec. 3(2) and Sec. 7bis(1) of Trade Mark Act is that for Sec. 3(2), the trademark should be \"particularly distinctive\" to the extent that of all people over Japan recognize it. Nevertheless, the Sec. 7bis(1) says that the trademark should be \"well-known\" for people who live in surrounding area to recognize it. The purpose of regional collective trademark is to protect the regional brands that are not associated with specific commercial origin, but with geographical area.The problems occurred since there are some other enterprises that do similar business in the same geographical area, and are not a member of association, but using the similar or identical trademark as the one holding regional collective trademark. There are three parties who used the similar trademark as Hakataori Industrial Association and violated the Trade Mark Act. and Unfair Competition Prevention Act. The first party is Nihon Wasou Holdings, Inc., who sells Japanese clothing and other related items. Second party is Hakata Takumi Kohgei Corporation, who is subsidiary of Nihon Wasou Holdings, Inc. and sells obi (Japanese belt which used the method of hakata-ori). Third party is Hakata Textile Products Association, who makes a certificate stamp on their goods using the same trademark as Hakataori Industrial Association.The second party, Hakata Takumi Kohgei Corporation had asked Hakataori Industrial Association to be their member so that they can use the same trademark, but they got rejected. In March 2009, Hakataori Industrial Association warned Hakata Takumi Kohgei Corporation for using the similar trademark as them. As a result, Hakata Takumi Kohgei Corporation changed their mark from \"hakata-ori\" to \"hakata-obi\". In May 2010, Hakata Takumi Kohgei Corporation asked Hakataori Industrial Association once again and got rejected.Fukuoka District Court solved the problems between them by applying the Sec. 26(1)(ii) (acts of descriptive use), so that Hakata Takumi Kohgei Corporation can still use the trademark similar to the  Hakataori Industrial Association's one but cannot be used as the same previous purpose. However, the problem will still remain if there is party who does not want to be the member of an association and using the similar trademark.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Fukuoka (\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02, Fukuoka-shi, pronounced [\u0278\u026f\u0325k\u026foka\ua71c\u0255i]) is the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, situated on the northern shore of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kinki region has a larger population than Kyoto. In ancient times, however, the area near Fukuoka, the Chikushi region, was thought by some historians to have possibly been even more influential than the Yamato region.\n\n\n== Pre-history ==\nExchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as Old Stone Age. It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia. Several Kofun exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFukuoka was sometimes called the Port of Dazaifu (\u5927\u5bb0\u5e9c), 15 km (9 mi) southeast from Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., but a historian proposed that a prehistoric capital was in the area. Ancient texts, such as the Kojiki, Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a very critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as Hakata which is the name of the central ward.\nIn 923, the Hakozaki-g\u016b in Fukuoka was transferred from Daibu-g\u016b in Daibu (\u5927\u5206), 16 km (10 mi) northeast from Dazaifu, the origin of Usa Shrine and established as a branch of the Usa Shrine at Fukuoka. In Ooho (\u5927\u4fdd), 15 km (9 mi) south from Dazaifu, there are remains of a big ward office with a temple, because in ancient East Asia, an emperor must have three great ministries (\u5927\u5bb0, \u5927\u50b3 and \u5927\u4fdd). In fact, there is a record in Chinese literature that a king of Japan sent a letter in 478 to ask the Chinese emperor's approval for employing three ministries. In addition, remains of the Korokan (\u9d3b\u81da\u9928, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.\n\n\n=== Mongol invasions (1274\u20131281) ===\n\nKublai Khan of the Mongol Empire turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.\nIn 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900 ships and 33,000 troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier 20 km (12 mi) in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.\nKublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.\nIt was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II.\n\n\n=== Formation of the modern city (1889) ===\n\nFukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the district was destroyed by fire during the Boshin War of 1868. \nThe modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of Hakata and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since Kuroda Nagamasa, the first daimy\u014d of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in Okayama Prefecture and the \"old Fukuoka\" is the main shopping area, now called Tenjin.\nWhen Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city. Hakata was initially chosen, but a group of samurai crashed the meeting and forced those present to choose Fukuoka as the name for the merged city. However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, Hakata Station, and dialect, Hakata-ben.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n1903: Fukuoka Medical College, a campus associated with Kyoto Imperial University, is founded. In 1911, the college is renamed Kyushu Imperial University and established as a separate entity.\n1910: Fukuoka streetcar service begins. (The service ran until 1979.)\n1929: Flights commence along the Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo route.\n1945: Fukuoka was firebombed on June 19, with the attack destroying 21.5 percent of the city's urban area.\n1947: First Fukuoka Marathon.\n1951: Fukuoka airport opens.\n1953: Fukuoka Zoo opens.\n1975: The city absorbed the town of Sawara.\n1981: Subway commences service.\n1988: Osaka's pro baseball team, the Nankai Hawks, are moved to Fukuoka and renamed the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (renamed the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2004).\n1989: Asian-Pacific Exposition is held.\n1997: The 30th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank was held in Fukuoka.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n2005: Fukuoka subway Nanakuma Line started operations.\n2014: Selected as the National Strategic Zone for \"global startups & job creation\" by the Japanese government.\n2020: City affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds Hakata Bay and opens on the north to the Genkai Sea.\nIt is located 1,100 km (684 mi) from Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFukuoka has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters. The city also sees on average about 1,600 mm (63 in) of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September. Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 16.3 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual daylight hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.\nWinter temperatures rarely drop below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and it rarely snows, though light rain does fall on most days if not as consistently as on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. Spring is warm and sunnier, with cherry blossoms appearing in late March or early April. The rainy season (tsuyu) lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the typhoon season runs between August and September.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53 am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen.A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.\nFukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be 22 km (14 mi) long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of 10 km (6 mi), this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be 40 km (25 mi) long.\nFollowing reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nFukuoka has 7 wards (ku).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of November 2018, the city had an estimated population of 1,581,527 and a population density of 4,515.64 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 343.39 square kilometres (132.58 sq mi). Fukuoka is Japan's youngest major city and has Japan's fastest growing population. Between December 2012 and December 2017, the proportion of foreign-born residents increased faster than any other major city in Japan, including Tokyo.There were 171 homeless residents counted in 2018's annual survey, down from a high of 969 in 2009.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFukuoka is the economic center of the Kyushu region, with an economy largely focused on the service sector. It is also the largest startup city in Japan, and is the only economic zone for startups. They have various services for startups like startup visa, tax reduction, and free business consultations. Fukuoka has the highest business-opening rate in Japan. Large companies headquartered in the city include Iwataya and Kyushu Electric Power. Fukuoka is also the home of many small firms playing a supportive role in the logistics, IT, and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Most of the region's heavy manufacturing takes place in the nearby city of Kitakyushu.\nThe GDP in Greater Fukuoka, Fukuoka Metropolitan Employment Area, was US$101.6 billion in 2010. Fukuoka is the primary economic center of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area, which is the 4th largest economy in Japan. As of 2014, the area's PPP-adjusted GDP is estimated to be larger than those of metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Vienna, Barcelona and Rome.Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting, Love FM, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and Television Nishinippon Corporation.\nThe port of Hakata and Fukuoka Airport also make the city a key regional transportation hub. Fukuoka houses the headquarters of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) and Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered in Hakata-ku; prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was also headquartered in Hakata-ku.Fukuoka has its own stock exchange, founded in 1949. It is one of six in Japan.Fukuoka is one of the more affordable cities in Japan. Compared to New York City, rents are ~80% lower, restaurants are ~50% cheaper, and groceries are ~5% more expensive. \n\n\n== Culture ==\nFukuoka was selected as one of Newsweek's 10 \"Most Dynamic Cities\" in its July 2006 issue. It was chosen for its central Asian location, increasing tourism and trade, and a large increase in volume at its sea and airport. Fukuoka has a diverse culture and a wide range of cultural attractions.\nIn its July/August 2008 issue, Monocle selected Fukuoka as number 17 of the \"Top 25 liveable cities\". It was chosen for excellent shopping, outstanding food, good transport links, good museums, \"a feeling of openness in its sea air\", green spaces and because it is friendly, safe, clean and close to the rest of East Asia. The same survey in 2018 ranked Fukuoka at number 22.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nFukuoka hosts more than 2 million foreign visitors annually, with the majority coming from neighboring South Korea, Taiwan and China. From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. After expansion and redevelopment of the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400.Nearly ten thousand international students attend universities in or near the Fukuoka prefecture each year. Nearly 200 international conferences are held each year in Fukuoka.\n\n\n==== Attractions ====\n\nSky Dream Fukuoka, in Fukuoka's western ward, was one of the world's largest Ferris wheels at a height of 120 meters. It was closed on September 2009. The surrounding shopping center, Marinoa City Fukuoka, still attracts millions of visitors each year. Other shopping centers that attract tourists include Canal City, JR Hakata City, and Hakata Riverain.Fukuoka Castle, located adjacent to Ohori Park in Maizuru Park, features the remaining stone walls and ramparts left after a devastating fire during the upheaval of the Meiji Restoration. It has now been preserved along with some reconstructed prefabricate concrete towers constructed during the 1950s and 1960s, when there was a trend across Japan to rebuild damaged castles as tourist attractions. \u014chori Park is also the location of one of Fukuoka City's major art galleries.\nThere are many temples with long histories including T\u014dch\u014d-ji, Hakozaki Shrine, Kashii shrine, and J\u014dten-ji.\nThe Marine Park Uminonakamichi is located on a narrow cape on the northern side of the Bay of Hakata. The park has an amusement park, petting zoo, gardens, beaches, a hotel, and a large marine aquarium which opened in 1989.For tourists from other parts of Japan, local foods such as mentaiko, Hakata ramen and motsunabe are associated with Fukuoka. Yatai (street stalls) serving ramen can be found in Tenjin and Nakasu most evenings.\nFukuoka Tower is near the beach in Seaside Momochi, a development built for the 1989 Asia-Pacific Exhibition. The older symbol of the city, Hakata Port Tower is next to the international ferry terminal and is free to enter.\nItoshima, to the west of Fukuoka city, has recently become a very popular tourist destination.

Of these, the most famous are Hakata Dontaku and Hakata Gion Yamakasa.\n\n\n==== Yamakasa ====\nYamakasa (\u5c71\u7b20), held for two weeks each July, is Fukuoka's oldest festival with a history of over 700 years. The festival dates back to 1241 when a priest called Shioichu Kokushi saved Hakata from a terrible plague by being carried around the city on a movable shrine and throwing water. Teams of men (no women, except small girls, are allowed), representing different districts in the city, commemorate the priest's route by racing against the clock around a set course carrying on their shoulders floats weighing several thousand pounds. Participants all wear shimekomi (called fundoshi in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.\nEach day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long happi coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional geta sandals. The costumes are worn with pride and are considered appropriate wear for even formal occasions, such as weddings and cocktail parties, during the festival.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Hakata Dontaku ====\nHakata Dontaku (\u535a\u591a\u3069\u3093\u305f\u304f) is held in Fukuoka City on May 3 and 4. Boasting over 800 years of history, Dontaku is attended by more than 2 million people, making it the festival with the highest attendance during Japan's Golden Week holidays. During the festival, stages are erected throughout downtown for traditional performances and a parade of floats is held. The full name is Hakata Dontaku Minato Matsuri.The festival was stopped for seven years during the Meiji era. Since it was restarted in the 12th year of the Meiji era it has been known as Hakata Dontaku.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNotable musical names in J-pop include Ayumi Hamasaki (allegedly Japan's richest woman), singer-songwriter Ringo Shiina, hugely popular singer-songwriter duo Chage & Aska, singer-songwriter Eri Nobuchika, Misia, Masamune Kusano and Yui.

        "wiki": "Nguyen Trinh Thi (born in 1973, Hanoi) is a Hanoi-based independent filmmaker, documentarian, and video artist. She is known for her layered, personal, and poetic approach to contentious histories and current events through experiments with the moving image. Regarded as one of the pioneers of her home country Vietnam's independent cinema, This is seen as the most notable video artist in Vietnam's contemporary art scene. She plays an important role the country's cinema, with works shown in international festivals and exhibitions.\nInspired by her heritage, her pieces are powerful and haunting, and focus on social and cultural issues \u2014 especially the complex, traumatic history of Vietnam and its after-effects in the present. In her longer documentary films, she employs calm and quiet visuals while eschewing voiceovers in order to let the people of her country speak directly to the camera. Her diverse practice has consistently investigated the role of memory in the necessary unveiling of hidden, displaced or misinterpreted histories; and examined the position of artists in the Vietnamese society.\n\n\n== Styles and Themes ==\nNguyen's works dealt with unspoken histories in Vietnam and called into question national agendas and societal norms. Her nuanced treatment of provocative and political content encapsulates the complexities of Southeast Asian history and the perplexing (and sometimes frustrating) role of the artist working within this multi-faceted sociopolitical framework.Her practice has consistently investigated the role of memory in the necessary unveiling of hidden, displaced, or misinterpreted histories, often making use of original documentary footage or undertaking extensive investigative field work. Her materials are diverse \u2013 from video and photographs shot by herself, to those appropriated from various sources including press photos, corporate videos, and classic films. Her practice traverses boundaries between film and video art, installation and performance.Trinh Thi is interested in History, the Truth, in taboo subjects. She gives voice to marginalized people in society, to those who have suffered trauma in the past. She is a filmmaker who dares to question the country's history, one that differs from the reconstruction produced by propaganda. Trinh Thi leads searches not only for reality, but is also for images. In her quest, she is constantly experimenting with new structures, formal tests on her creative path. She goes from the live-movie (Love man love woman) to found-footage thumbnail (Song to the front), from experimental documentary (Chronicle of a Tape Recorded Over) to video installations (Unsubtitled, Que faire). At the core of her work, a progressive exploration of her personal vision, Trinh Thi pays attention to gestural details, to the expressive faces of people who expose themselves and emerge from the backdrop of a chaotic world. Her gaze is silent, anxious, humanist.\n\n\n== Life and Education ==\nNguyen Trinh Thi studied journalism, photography, international relations, and ethnographic film in the United States. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian and English from Hanoi Foreign Studies College, Hanoi, in 1994; a master's degree in Professional Journalism, University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1999; and Master of Pacific International Affairs, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), in 2005.\nAfter studying journalism and photography at the University of Iowa; and international studies and ethnographic film at University of California, San Diego, she decided to return to Vietnam to pursue a career as an independent filmmaker at a time when this concept was still foreign and filmmaking was very difficult due to censorship. Thi returned to her home country, Vietnam, after spending many years in the United States, where she studied journalism and filmmaking among other things. Here, documentary films had primarily been the domain of the Vietnam Documentary & Scientific Studio, which produces films by order of the government. A free documentary film scene was practically non-existent, for numerous reasons: There was no access to work opportunities, production budgets and distribution channels, as well as to training opportunities, contacts to the international scene and knowledge about the development trends of documentary films elsewhere in the world. This was augmented by the pressure of censorship and the lack of interest of the general public, which equated documentary films with propaganda. So there were many different obstacles preventing a documentary film culture from developing in Vietnam.In 2009, Nguyen founded and directs Hanoi DocLab, an educational center and studio for the production of documentary films and video art in Hanoi.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Letters from Panduranga (2015) ===\nThrough a network of Champa scholars, Nguyen spent a number of residency periods in Ninh Thuan between 2013 and 2015. Letters from Panduranga extends her experimentation between documentary and fiction in an essay film portraying a Cham community living in the most southern and last surviving territory of Champa, an ancient kingdom dating back nearly two thousand years and conquered by Dai Viet (present day Vietnam) in 1832. The essay film, made in the form of a letter exchange between two filmmakers, was inspired by the fact that the Vietnamese government is to build Vietnam's first two nuclear power plants in Ninh Thuan, right at the spiritual heart of the Cham people, threatening the survival of this ancient matriarchal Hindu culture. Public discussions regarding the project have been largely absent in Vietnam due to strict government controls over public speech and media, and local communities have also been excluded from consultations.\nThe film alludes to the legacy of war and colonialism; exploring and reflecting on landscape and portrait, documentary and fiction, and art and ethnography as methods of working in film and art, and their limitations in accessing other cultures, peoples, and experiences, as well as history and the past.\nNguyen Trinh Thi says, \"As artists, we have contradictory desires: to be engaged, but also to disappear.\"\nAmong other references are facts relating to the United States' destructive bombing during the Vietnam War, artifacts from colonial exhibitions and art collections, the vulgar place of tourists and the cultural policies of UNESCO, and quotes from one of Nguyen's main influences, Chris Marker, notably his film essay Letter from Siberia (1957), and Statues Also Die (1953), both of which were incisive and novel in their critique of the impacts of industrial and colonial movements.\nIn previously mentioned Art Radar interview it was asked: In Letters from Panduranga, you said you did not want to speak on behalf of the \"other\" \u2013 the Cham community. However, they are part of contemporary Vietnam and their history has been subsumed into Vietnamese history. Why were you nervous to represent the Cham people?\nTo which Nguyen responded: Although we are all part of Vietnam now, we belong to very different groups. Vietnam is a national group, but there are so many methods of categorisation. My biggest concern was that I was imposing my perspective and vision on them. After the trip, I made a version that was more like a documentary, but I didn't like it. It felt like the film was pretending to be objective, without really reflecting the depth and complexity of the story. Letters from Panduranga is not a film solely about the Cham people. I tried to connect their struggle to a broader issue \u2013 suppression of our voices. As I mentioned earlier, the underlying theme is power structures and who can use the image.\n\n\n=== Song to the Front (2011\u20132012) ===\nNguyen Trinh Thi re-edited the historical Vietnamese war film, B\u00e0i Ca Ra Tr\u1eadn, which was originally produced in 1973 by the Vietnam Feature Film Studio. She transformed the obscure black-and-white classic into a vignette that deconstructed the melodramatic and romanticized elements of social-realist drama.\nAn original Northern Vietnamese film, Song to the Front is a propagandist story of patriotism, a typical genre of this style of cinema that glorifies the heroic struggle of the proletariat class. Nguyen uses a form of suspense editing akin to the mastery of Hitchcock, where the composition of the lens, grade of color, and sound dramatizes the narrative. In Nguyen's edit, this near-blinded young man is shown as a human being with emotion who transforms into a fighting machine. A starry-lit sky cuts in and then a series of birds take flight. This young man's eyes may be bandaged but his memories give him strength. After receiving surgery for his battle wounds, this heroic soldier is very weak with poor sight, but determined to continue to fight. The piece ends with the sounds of firing bullets and a young man's crazed glee at qualifying as marksman to return to the front with a gun in his hands.\nNguyen extrapolates the central narrative of the film into a five-minute abstraction, her jump cuts and use of still frames are heightened with her use of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, referring to the ritual in pre-Christian Russia where a young girl dances herself to death \u2013 a vision that Stravinsky claimed was to propitiate the god of Spring. For Nguyen, these young soldiers who gave their lives for their country are the sacrificed pagans.Her version of 'Song to the Front' plays with the original plot line in a deliberately ambiguous manner, designing an imaginative space for the viewer to reinterpret what were intended to be very literal epics that enforce an ideological view.\n\n\n=== Series: \"Unsubtitled\" (2010), \"Que faire\" (2012), and \"Solo for a Choir\" (2013) ===\nIn this series, Nguyen explores the possibilities for combining video installation with performance art, and of preserving differences of individuals while creating a sense of collective experience. Nguyen worked on a long-term film project about the Nh\u00e2n V\u0103n\u2013Giai Ph\u1ea9m affair \u2013 the suppressed literary movement of the 1950s and the only instance of widespread intellectual dissidence ever to occur in North Vietnam \u2013 and its legacy of dissent in Vietnamese art over the past five decades. Thematically, she continues to study these issues and reflects on the history and development of the role and position of the artist in Vietnamese society and issues related to Vietnam's problems concerning censorship and artist freedom of expression. Nguyen invited nineteen Hanoi artists who make up the social constellation of Nha San Studio to face the camera, eat a food item of their choice, and to then state their name followed by the food item they had just consumed. Individually, these are statements parodying the Maoist practice of self-criticism, interrogation sessions where the artist in question must unequivocally explain the meaning of his work. Collectively, the chorus evokes a quiet protest against the long-running methods of surveillance and intimidation that are still pervasive in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Landscape Series #1 (2013) ===\nNguyen's Landscape Series #1 (2013) meditates on the idea of the landscape \"as the silent witness of history.\" During her search for photos, Nguyen came across hundreds of images of unidentified people in landscapes in the same position: pointing to indicate a past event, the location of something gone, something lost or missing. In these images, the figures are all in a similar pose, pointing at something unseen in the distance \u2013 a drama, a disappearance, a tragic episode, something that clearly seems to represent a past or a present threat, a yawning gap \u2013 which, since it cannot be seen, can only be pointed out. Together these anonymous witnesses, portrayed in compelling uniformity by innumerable Vietnamese press photographers, seem to be indicating a direction, a way forward out of the past, a fictional journey.\n\n\n=== Love Man Love Woman (2007) ===\nNguyen's documentary Love Man Love Woman (2007) explores the lives of gay men in Vietnam and focuses on the prevalent theme of repression in society. The film portrays master Luu Ngoc Duc, a famous spirit medium in Hanoi, as well the Mother Goddess cult in Vietnam, whose communities offer a haven to many gay Vietnamese. The Dong Co, or the religion's priestesses, perform rites and rituals that include dazzling altars, flamboyant costumes, candles, incense, sequins, and feathers.Love Man Love Woman is not an ethnographic film about the Dao Mau community. The essence of the film is Master Luu Ngoc Duc, a spirit medium of the religion. He has a very rich Vietnamese vocabulary and was always quoting literature, poetry and folk phrases. It is amazing to watch him talk, and that kind of language is dying. Young people don't talk like that anymore, even I find my Vietnamese so poor.She has produced documentary and experimental films that have been screened in film festivals in USA, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Brazil, and in Europe. She has taken part in international exhibitions such as Singapore Biennale 2013, Jakarta Biennale 2013, Move on Asia: Video Art in Asia 2002 to 2012 (ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art, Germany 2013), Women in Between: Asian Women Artists 1984-2012 (Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Japan 2012),and Kuandu Biennale (Taiwan 2010). Based in Hanoi, she also founded and directs Hanoi DOCLAB, a center for documentary films and the moving image since 2009.She's had participation in the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen; Arthub, Bangkok. Exhibitions a.o. at the Tate Modern, London; Stenersen Museet, Oslo. Solo exhibitions a.o. at NhaSan Studio, Hanoi; Kuandu Biennale, Taipei.Two of her video works, Love Man Love Woman (2007) and Letters from Panduranga (2015) were showcased at NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore (NTU CCA Singapore) for the exhibition \"Ghosts and Spectres\u2014Shadows of History\", which ended on 19 November 2017. \n\n\n== DocLab ==\nThi worked together with a group of filmmakers and artists to elaborate a concept for a centre for documentary films and video art, described as \"a centre with its focus on education, art, research and experimentation\". The name was suddenly there, DocLab, a lab for experiments and a Vietnamese play with the sound of words and their meanings, and the right place was also found promptly: in the building of the Hanoi Goethe Institute, as, due to the cultural agreement, this was the only place with free access and a censure-free area. Despite considerable resistance, Thi and a small group of Vietnamese filmmakers and artists have succeeded in building a centre step by step with the help of the Goethe Institute which provides training and promotes exchange in the area of documentary films besides having produced a community of committed young filmmakers who are increasingly networked with the international scene, thereby pushing open a door to the world for Vietnamese documentary films.In 2007, she founded Hanoi Independent Documentary & Experimental Filmmakers Forum (Hi-DEFF) to encourage independent filmmaking in Vietnam and collaborations among artists, filmmakers and others that holds biweekly documentary and experimental film screenings in Hanoi.Nguyen is the founding director of Hanoi DocLab (2009), a centre which provides training besides having produced a community of committed young filmmakers who are increasingly networked with the international documentary scene, where she continues to teach today. DOCLAB is a center/lab for documentary filmmaking and video art opened in October 2009 and based at the Goethe Institute in Hanoi. Their activities include:\n\u2022 Basic film and video training courses\n\u2022 Editing, sound-designing and writing workshops\n\u2022 Weekly screenings and discussions opened for everyone\n\u2022 Editing lab for filmmakers and video artists\n\u2022 Video/film and book library accessible to the public\nIn a 2017 interview with Art Radar when asked, \"Do you think that it is part of the role of the artist in Southeast Asia to create platforms for public exposure in the arts?\"\nShe answered: \"DOCLAB came out of a need to start a community. Before I moved back to Vietnam, there were not many independent artist communities in Hanoi. Community is very important when you work as an independent artist. When I lived in Los Angeles, I was close to the Echo Park Film Center and it was very inspiring for me. When I moved back to Hanoi, I became involved in different film projects and learned more about the local conditions through those experiences. When the Goethe Institute offered a grant to do something in documentary film, I already had an idea about what we needed locally and the best approach to take in building such an organisation. Over the years, DOCLAB became a complete system with training courses, screenings, exchange, and now we even have festivals. I taught there for the first three years but now I've stopped to focus on my own work.\"\nIn a 2010 interview when asked, \"what affect do you think this will have on the nurturing of film practice and screening in Vietnam?\"\nShe answered: \"I don't have any ambitions in changing the film practice in Vietnam. This is a very small effort; it won't change the industry a bit. I'm also not training professional people. I hope to give people larger exposure to practices of documentary filmmaking in the world, encourage them to create and think for themselves. Actually people who come to the training and screenings come from all kinds of disciplines. We're also hoping to nurture a local audience with a more critical awareness of documentary and experimental film, and video art.\"\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\"Eleven Men\": found footage (2016)\"Jo Ha Kyu\": experimental film, 10 minutes, HD video, color (2012)\n\"I Died for Beauty\", experimental film, 7 minutes, HD video, color (2012)\n\"Rain, Poems, Toilet Paper\": documentary, 70 minutes, video, color (in production)\n\"Song to the Front\": experimental film, 5 minutes, B&W (2011) (#1 in project \"Vietnamese Classics Re-Cut Series\")\n\"Unsubtitled\": video installation (various loops), HD video, color (2011)\n\"Chronicle of a Tape Recorded Over\": experimental documentary, 25 minutes, video, color (2011)\n\"Terminal\": video, single channel, 5 minutes, color (2009)\n\"Spring Comes Winter After\": experimental video, 6 minutes, color (2009)\n\"93 Years, 1383 Days\": experimental documentary, 30 minutes, video, color (2008)\n\"Love Man Love Woman\": documentary, 52 minutes, video, color (2007)\n\"A Chungking Road Opening\": documentary,20 minutes, video, color (2005)\n\n\n== Exhibitions/ Screenings ==\nNguyen Trinh Thi's documentary and experimental films have been screened at international festivals and art exhibitions including Jeu de Paume, Paris (2015); CAPC mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux; the Lyon Biennale (2015); Asian Art Biennial, Taipei, Taiwan (2015), Taiwan; 5th Fukuoka Triennale, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Japan (2014);  Finalist Exhibition, APBF Signature Art Prize, Singapore Art Museum (2014); 15th Jakarta Biennale, Indonesia (2013); \"If The World Changed,\" 4th Singapore Biennale (2013); \"Move on Asia: Video Art in Asia 2002 to 2012,\" ZKM, Karlsruhe, Germany (2013); Okinawa Prefecture Art Museum, Japan (2012); and DMZ International Documentary Film Festival, Korea (2011); Oberhausen International Film Festival; Bangkok Experimental Film Festival; Artist Films International; Summer Exhibition 2011, DEN FRIE Centre of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen; Unsubtitled, solo video installation, NhaSan Studio, Hanoi; 'PLUS/ Memories and Beyond \u2013 10 Solo Exhibitions by 10 Asian Artists', Kuandu Biennale, Taipei; and 'No Soul For Sale 2', Tate Modern, London.Screenings / Exhibitions\n2012     Four Rising Talents From Southeast Asia, 10 Chancery Lane Gallery, Hong Kong\nArt In The Auditorium (Artist Film International): Season 4 Screening, Seescape Gallery, Chiang Mai, Thailand\n            Screening, Bangkok Experimental Film Festival, Bangkok, Thailand\n2011     Summer Exhibition, video installation, Den Frie Centre of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen\n            Skylines without Flying People, Rory Gill Fine Art Gallery, London, UK\n            Unsubtitled, screening, Corpo Plumhill Playhouse, Tokyo, Japan\n            Screening, DMZ International Documentary Film Festival, Korea\n2010     Unsubtitled, solo video installation, NhaSan Studio, Hanoi, Vietnam\nPLUS/ Memories and Beyond \u2013 10 Solo Exhibitions by 10 Asian Artists, Kuandu Biennale, Taipei, Taiwan\n            No Soul For Sale 2, Tate Modern, London, UK\n            The City in Art - Part 3, Goethe Institute, Hanoi, Vietnam\n2009     The Making of the New Silk Roads, ArtHub, Bangkok, Thailand\n            Lim Dim, Stenersen Museum, Oslo, Norway\n            Time Ligaments, exhibition, 10 Chancery Lane Gallery, Hong Kong\n            Vietnamese International Film Festival (ViFF), California\n            Yunnan Multi Culture Visual Festival, Kunming, China\n2008     10+, a contemporary art exhibition at Nha San Studio, Hanoi, Vietnam\nStrategies from Within: An Exhibition of Vietnamese and Cambodian Contemporary Art Practices, Ke Center for Contemporary Arts, Shanghai, China\nIn the course of our exchange, exhibition, Yunart Contemporary Art Gallery, Kunming, China\n           Festival Costante Cambiamento, Florence, Italy\n            Jean Rouch International Film Festival, Paris, FranceSelection of festivals and installations: Oberhausen International Film Festival; Bangkok Experimental Film Festival; Artist Films International; Summer Exhibition 2011, DENFRIE Centre of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen; Unsubtitled, solo video installation, NhaSan Studio, Hanoi; 'PLUS / Memories and Beyond \u2013 10 Solo Exhibitions by 10 Asian Artists', Kuandu Biennale, Taipei; 'No Soul For Sale 2', Tate Modern, London, etc...I'm a Straight of World War 2 experientially they the letting sounds progressive galvanize the world Manchu the mountain the impending the trauma the very l\u1ecbch s\u1eed(History) Poem written by Nguyen Trinh Thi as part of the artistic project \"Chance operation film\" during the exhibition \"Skyline with flying people\".

        "wiki": "Japan (; Japanese: \u65e5\u672c, Nippon [\u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274] (listen) or Nihon [\u0272iho\ua71c\u0274] (listen)) is an island country in East Asia. Located in the northwest Pacific Ocean, it borders the Sea of Japan to the west, and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Japan is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and comprises an archipelago of 6,852 islands covering 375,000 square kilometers (145,000 sq mi); its five largest islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city; other major cities include Osaka and Nagoya.\nJapan is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 126.2 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is administratively divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally divided into eight regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nArchaeological finds indicate that the archipelago was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period, though the first written mentions of the islands appear in Chinese texts from the first century AD. Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto). Beginning from the twelfth century, however, political power was held by a succession of military dictators (sh\u014dgun), feudal lords (daimy\u014d), and a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was unified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted a policy of isolation. This period ended in 1854 when a U.S. fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, leading to the fall of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, Japan adopted a Western-style constitution and pursued rapid industrialization and modernization. In 1937, the Empire of Japan invaded China; in 1941, it entered World War II on the side of the Axis powers. After suffering defeat in the Pacific theater and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945 and came under a brief occupation, during which it adopted a post-war constitution. Japan has since maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with the Emperor as the head of state and an elected legislature known as the National Diet.\nJapan is a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, the OECD, and the G7. Although it has officially renounced its right to declare war, Japan maintains a modern military that ranks as the world's fourth most-powerful. Following World War II, the country experienced rapid economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990. As of 2019, Japan's economy is the third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by purchasing power parity. Japan is ranked \"very high\" on the Human Development Index; its citizens enjoy the longest life expectancy in the world, although the country's population is currently in decline due to low birth rates. Japan is a global leader in the automotive and electronics industries and has made significant contributions to contemporary science and technology, notably in the field of robotics. Culturally, Japan is renowned around the world for its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, including its prominent animation and video game industries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe names for Japan in Japanese are Nippon and Nihon; both names are written using the kanji \u65e5\u672c. Nippon is the spelling and pronunciation most often used in official contexts, including on yen banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is a variant more commonly used in everyday speech, as in the phrases Nihonjin (\u65e5\u672c\u4eba, \"Japanese people\") and Nihongo (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, \"Japanese language\"). The characters \u65e5\u672c literally mean \"sun-origin\", a reference to Japan's eastern location relative to China. The name is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\". Before the name was adopted in the 8th century, Japan was known in China as Wa (\u502d) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.The name Japan was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin (possibly Wu Chinese) pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Jepang or Jepun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and later encountered by Portuguese traders in Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the 16th century. The first recorded version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric to classical history ===\n\nA Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the start of the J\u014dmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands intermingling with the J\u014dmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from Korea and China.Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called Yamatai-koku. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean Kingdom), but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class (including figures such as Prince Sh\u014dtoku) and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592\u2013710).After defeat in the Battle of Baekgang by the Chinese Tang dynasty, the Japanese government devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince \u014cama and his nephew Prince \u014ctomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih\u014d Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the ritsury\u014d state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.The Nara period (710\u2013784) marked an emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735\u2013737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-ky\u014d, then to Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.\n\n\n=== Feudal era ===\n\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed sh\u014dgun and established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came to power as regents for the sh\u014dguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573). However, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy\u014ds) and a civil war (the \u014cnin War) began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy\u014ds; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131603). After Nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori, and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh\u014dgun by Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy\u014ds, and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603\u20131868). Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the sh\u014dgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the Emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935.The early 20th century saw a period of Taish\u014d democracy (1912\u20131926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of Radical Nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7\u20138, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, beginning World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives, and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth saw Japan become the second-largest economy in the world; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\". In the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became the new Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nJapan comprises 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3,000 km (1,900 mi) northeast\u2013southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China and Philippine Seas. The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi). Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751 km (18,486 mi)). Due to its many far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries. Approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise and Wakayama Marina City.\n\nThe islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. Japan was originally attached to the Eurasian continent; the subducting plates opened the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago. Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami. Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter. In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round. The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp\u014d Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 \u00b0C (41.2 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 \u00b0C (77.4 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 \u00b0C (106.0 \u00b0F), was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry\u016bky\u016b and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.As of 2015, more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Prior to this incident, Japan's emissions had been on the decline, largely due to nuclear power plants creating no emissions. Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. He is defined in the Constitution as \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people\". Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the current Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, 2019.\n\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The Diet is currently dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955. The Prime Minister is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. As the head of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State. Following the LDP victory in the 2012 general election, Shinz\u014d Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the Prime Minister.Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post\u2013World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the Constitution requires that the Emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature, and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 22 years. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008. It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014. In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan for partially that purpose.Japan's relationship with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia: Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G20 Summit to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region.Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nJapan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces \u2013 JSDF) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The JMSDF is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. The Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include: the establishment of the National Security Council (NSC), the adoption of the National Security Strategy (NSS), and the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG). In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.\n\n\n=== Domestic law enforcement ===\n\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency, and supervised by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.Additionally, there is the Japan Coast Guard which guards territorial waters. The coast guard patrols the sea surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2016, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.As of 2016, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent. Some 20 million people, around 17 percent of the population, were below the poverty line in 2007. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. As of 2014, Japan's main export markets were the United States (20.2 percent), China (17.5 percent), South Korea (7.1 percent), Hong Kong (5.6 percent) and Thailand (4.5 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2015 were China (24.8 percent), the United States (10.5 percent), Australia (5.4 percent) and South Korea (4.1 percent). Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country. Junichir\u014d Koizumi's administration began some pro-competition reforms, and foreign investment in Japan has soared.Japan ranks 34th of 190 countries in the 2018 ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods like \"The Toyota Way\", and shareholder activism is rare. Japan also has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world located in Japan, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world.Today, Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015\u20132016.\n\n\n=== Agriculture and fishery ===\n\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometers (14,000,000 acres) cultivated. Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.In 1996, Japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught. Japan ranked seventh and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. In 2003, total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nJapan has a large industrial capacity, and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. Some major Japanese industrial companies include Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel.Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world, and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.  Despite facing competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.\n\n\n=== Services and tourism ===\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, \u00c6ON, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven & I, KDDI and Japan Airlines listed as some of the largest in the world. Four of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. The six major keiretsus are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa Groups.Japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015 and increased by 21.8% to attract 24.03 million international tourists in 2016. In 2008, the Japanese government set up Japan Tourism Agency and set the initial goal to increase foreign visitors to 20 million in 2020. In 2016, having met the 20 million target, the government revised up its target to 40 million by 2020 and to 60 million by 2030. For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015. Japan is one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis, and it was by far the least visited country in the G7 until 2014.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, which relative to gross domestic product is the third highest budget in the world. The country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine and three Fields medalists.Japanese scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% of the world's industrial robots as of 2013. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 per 10,000 employees.The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. Japan became a major exporter of video games during the golden age of arcade video games, an era that began with the release of Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and ended around the mid-1980s. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s, and it dominated the industry until Microsoft's Xbox consoles began challenging Sony and Nintendo in the 2000s. As of 2009, $6 billion of Japan's $20 billion gaming market is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home console games and mobile games at $3.5 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Japan is now the world's largest market for mobile games; in 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib\u014d) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in, 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nJapan's road spending has been extensive. Its 1.2 million kilometers (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation. As of 2012, Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometers (755,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometers (635,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 129,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 55,000 kilometers (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 8,050 kilometers (5,000 miles) of national expressways. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (Hokkaido has a separate network). Cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality. A new Maglev line called the Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen is being constructed between Tokyo and Nagoya. It is due to be completed in 2027.There are 175 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, is Asia's second-busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport. Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nAs of 2011, 46.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power and 3.3% from hydropower. Nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011, down from 24.9 percent the previous year. However, by May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. Reactors at Sendai restarted in 2015. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nThe government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. 97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million, of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019). Honsh\u016b is the world's second most populous island and has 80% of Japan's population. In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018). It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).Japanese society is linguistically, ethnically and culturally homogeneous, composed of 98.1% ethnic Japanese, with small populations of foreign workers. The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan. In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents) and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians, the largest community of Westerners.Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010\u20132015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post\u2013World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050. On September 15, 2018, for the first time, one in five Japanese residents was aged 70 or older. 26.18 million people are 70 or older and accounted for 20.7 percent of the population. Elderly women crossed the 20 million line at 20.12 million, substantially outnumbering the nation's 15.45 million elderly men. The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050.Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new naturalized citizens per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000. On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nJapan has full religious freedom based on its constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84\u201396 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d). However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual, despite participating in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition. As a result, religious statistics are often under-reported in Japan. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians, most of them living in the western part of the country.  As of 2007, there were 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.Islam in Japan is estimated to constitute about 80\u201390% of foreign born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Many of the ethnic Japanese Muslims are those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.Other minority religions include Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith; since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nMore than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery after World War II when the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the standard school system. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 4.1 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 5.0 percent. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth.  In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent. In addition, 60.4 percent Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nIn Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.Japan has a high suicide rate; suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30. Another significant public health issue is smoking. Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.\n\n\n=== Art and architecture ===\n\nJapanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.Japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz\u014d Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.\n\n\n=== Literature and philosophy ===\n\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.During the Edo period, the ch\u014dnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash\u014d revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh\u016b with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai were the first \"modern\" novelists of Japan, followed by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors \u2013 Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce (1994).Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers. Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentar\u014d Taki. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan.The four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky\u014dgen, kabuki, and bunraku. Noh and ky\u014dgen theater traditions are among the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.\n\n\n=== Etiquette ===\n\nThe code of etiquette in Japan governs the expectations of social behavior. Honne and tatemae (\u672c\u97f3\u3068\u5efa\u524d) contrasts a person's true feelings and the behavior one displays in public. Yamato-damashii (\u5927\u548c\u9b42) describes the indigenous Japanese 'spirit' or cultural values as opposed to cultural values of foreign nations. Wa (\u548c) is a Japanese cultural concept that implies a peaceful unity and conformity within a social group, in which members prefer the continuation of a harmonious community over their personal interests.  Ishin-denshin (\u4ee5\u5fc3\u4f1d\u5fc3) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding. Isagiyosa (\u6f54\u3055) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world. Hansei (\u53cd\u7701) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (\u8a00\u970a) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names.\nJapan is regarded by sociologists as a high-context culture. People are more observant of hierarchical differences and communicate less explicitly and verbosely. High context cultures such as Japan are more focused upon in-groups while low context cultures are focused upon individuals. Face-saving (to avoid being humiliated) is generally considered as more important in Japan's high-context culture than in low-context ones such as the United States or Germany.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nJapanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food, quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.\nSeafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staple of Japanese cuisine, typically seasoned with a combination of dashi, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Dishes inspired by foreign food\u2014in particular Chinese food\u2014like ramen and gy\u014dza, as well as foods like spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers have become adopted with variants for Japanese tastes and ingredients. Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish. Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.Popular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that, typically, contains 14\u201317% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 1800s. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in various forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\n\n\n=== Holidays and festivals ===\n\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H\u014dritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh\u014dwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.There are many annual festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese matsuri (\u796d). There are no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nTelevision and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. Over the 1990s, television surpassed newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium.There are six nationwide television networks: NHK (public broadcasting), Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi (EX) and TV Tokyo Network (TXN). Television networks were mostly established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese television shows. According to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.Japanese readers have a choice of approximately 120 daily newspapers, with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers per household. The main newspapers are the Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in 1999, 85.4 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women read a newspaper every day.Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; movies have been produced in Japan since 1897. Ishir\u014d Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Japan has won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film four times, more than any other Asian country.\nJapanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced. Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936 and is widely considered to be the highest level of professional baseball in the world outside of the North American Major Leagues. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.Japan has significant involvement in motorsport. Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan also have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series. The country also hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix, Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka 10 Hours, 6 Hours of Fuji, FIA WTCC Race of Japan and the Indy Japan 300.\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. Further, the country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record six times and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011. Japan also hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Japan-related articles\nOutline of Japan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Government\n\nJapanGov \u2013 The Government of Japan (in English)\nPrime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet Official website (in English)\nThe Imperial Household Agency, official site of the Imperial House of Japan\nNational Diet Library General information\n\nJapan from UCB Libraries GovPubs\nJapan at Curlie\nJapan Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica entry\nJapan profile from BBC News\nJapan from the OECD\n Geographic data related to Japan at OpenStreetMap",

It is also the autumn falls and \u8292\u8349 seasons which matches the feel of the park. The number",
          "Definitely worth a bisit if you are interested in history. We caught the Midori express from Hakata station in Fukuoka. The park is 750 m from the Yoshinogar-coen station. It is well sign posted and there is a taxi stand at the station if needed. The park is quite spread out",
          "The park area is large, and mostly outdoor, so you won't enjoy it on rainy or windy days. The entrance fee in April 2017 was 420 Yen per person (adult). We suggest taking a free bus around first, to gauge how big the area is and to see where you would like to focus. Many",

          "We spent there half a day just wandering around and visiting plenty of remains of japanese historical heritage. The place is huge and was totally empty in the middle of July. You can feel the history there visiting different venues from the past.",

          "This park is huge! It was built in a major archeological area, where over 3,000 ceramic burial jars were discovered. You can see some actual burial mounds and reconstructions of the ceramic burial jars that were used instead of coffins. But the highlight is the full-scale",
          "I highly recommended this park. I visited the park with my family, mom dad and my son. At first, I thought its only a normal park with some traditional house inside. But it is a huge park with traditional houses in several areas, really worth to see. In addition, the park also",
          "It was the first time we used the ancient method to make fire and it was a wonderful experience. It was so amazing that we made fire by rubbing wood. Ancient people were so smart. My son was extremely excited when the fire was made. It was a good activity for family with",

        "wiki": "Hakata-ku (\u535a\u591a\u533a) is a ward of the city of Fukuoka in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.\nMany of Fukuoka Prefecture and Fukuoka City's principal government, commercial, retail and entertainment establishments are located in the district. Hakata-ku is also the location of Fukuoka's main train station, Hakata Station, Fukuoka Airport and the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakata-ku is a ward of Fukuoka City located on its eastern edge. It is 31.47 km2 with a population of 206,629 (current January 1, 2009). Much of the ward consists of low-lying plains beside the Mikasa River (\u5fa1\u7b20\u5ddd, Mikasagawa). The northwestern end of the ward faces Hakata Bay, which includes both ferry and international cruise ship terminals Hakata Harbor (\u535a\u591a\u6e2f, Hakata k\u014d). The northeast end of the ward is slightly elevated, and is named Higashihirao (\u6771\u5e73\u5c3e), with nearby Fukuoka Airport. Around Hakata Station is downtown; Nakasu (\u4e2d\u6d32) is the main dining and entertainment district of the ward along the Naka River (\u90a3\u73c2\u5ddd, Nakagawa). Hakata-ku also houses the Fukuoka Prefectural office.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nMany Japanese companies have established branch offices in Hakata-ku due to its ease of access to local government offices as well transportation hubs such as Hakata Station and Fukuoka Airport. The headquarters of JR Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Best Denki, and many other companies are in the ward.Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered on the grounds of Fukuoka Airport in Hakata-ku. Link Airs has its headquarters in the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building (\u798f\u5ca1\u7947\u5712\u7b2c\u4e00\u751f\u547d\u30d3\u30eb Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Biru) in Hakata-ku. Cisco has an Asia-Pacific sales office on the 12th floor of the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building.Prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was headquartered on the grounds of the airport in Hakata-ku.Hakata's economy was significantly transformed in 1996 with the opening of Canal City Hakata, an award-winning destination shopping and entertainment center.\n\n\n=== Cruise ship tourism ===\nFrom the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China.\nIn 2014, 91 cruise ships travelled from China called at Hakata. In 2015, 245 cruise ship calls were made at Hakata Port. After expansion and redevelopment of the port facilities, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400. As of 2015, the largest passenger vessel making regular port calls at Hakata is the Royal Caribbean International owned MS Quantum of the Seas.\nPartly as a result of growing international tourism, in 2015 Fukuoka reported the fastest rising tax revenues and population in Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nHakata is one of the oldest cities in Japan. In the Middle Ages Hakata, which faces onto the Genkai-Nada Channel (\u7384\u754c\u7058) dividing Japan from Korea, was a base for merchants who traded with China and Korea, and the city housed Japan's first Chinatown. Taira no Kiyomori is said to have built the artificial harbor Sode-no-minato (\u8896\u306e\u6e4a) to increase commerce. Hakata was burned down by many wars, including the Mongol invasions.\n\nIn the early Edo period, Kuroda Nagamasa, appointed the lord of Chikuzen Province, and most of his samurai vassals lived in Fukusaki, on the opposite shore of the Naka River from Hakata. Kuroda Nagamasa changed the name of the area to Fukuoka after his home town; Fukuoka in Okayama Prefecture. He ordered Tachibana Castle and Najima Castle dismantled, and had Fukuoka Castle built using the stones from those older castles. At that time Hakata was no larger than one square kilometer, demarcated by defensive lines along the Naka River, the Boshu-bori (or Boshu Canal), and the Ishido or Mikasa River.\nIn 1876, Hakata, then also known as Dai-Ni-Dai-ku, and Fukuoka, or Dai-Ichi-Dai-ku, were merged. In 1878 the settlement was renamed Fukuoka-ku (\u798f\u5ca1\u533a) by the Fukuoka prefectural government, though the population of Hakata was 25,677 and that of Fukuoka was 20,410. At that time, the name Hakata vanished from the administration. In 1889, after a local referendum in which half the voters chose the name Fukuoka and half chose Hakata, the city was officially renamed Fukuoka-shi, but at the same time a new train station then being built was named Hakata Station.\nAn imperial decree issued in July 1899 established Hakata as an open port for trade with the United States and the United Kingdom.In 1972, when Fukuoka City was granted designated status by government ordinance, a ward including the old Hakata area was given the name Hakata-ku.\nIn 2016 a large sinkhole appeared in the city center just west of Hakata station. The sinkhole was filled and the affected roads were completely repaired within a few days, in what some called a testament to Japanese ingenuity. However, the hasty repair seems to have been problematic as less than a month later the road began showing signs of imminent implosion.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nHakata was the traditional center for the manufacture of Hakata ningy\u014d, which are traditional Japanese dolls that are famous throughout Japan. Today, almost all Hakata ningy\u014d makers (Hakata ningy\u014d shi) have their factories out of the Old Hakata Area, a part of modern Hakata-ku.\nHakata-ori is a textile used for obis of kimonos.It is also the home of Mentai Rock, named after the popular mentaiko dish served in the region, that spawned numerous J-pop idols during the early 1980s. Neo Mentai Rock is the name given to a recent renewal in activity from local musicians.\nHakata-ben is the local Japanese dialect spoken in the Old Hakata Area.\nHakata is also the location of the pop group HKT48.\nAnouther popular group from Hakata are Kanikapila\nParts of the famous crime novel 'Points and lines' ('Ten to Sen' in Japanese) by the award-winning Japanese writer Seich\u014d Matsumoto occur in Hakata and its train station.\n\n\n=== Famous foods ===\nMentaiko\nTonkotsu (pork bone) ramen, also called simply Hakata ramen\nMotsunabe\nJapanese cheesecake\nMizutaki - Nabemono of chicken\nHakata Torimon (ja:\u535a\u591a\u901a\u308a\u3082\u3093) - a type of cake\nHakata no Hito - a type of cake\nTsukemen (dipping noodles)\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nHakata Dontaku Minato Matsuri - May 3 and 4\nHakata Gion Yamakasa - from July 1 to 15\nHakata O-kunchi - October 23 and 24 (prior to 1953, November 23)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nJR West\nSany\u014d Shinkansen\nHakata Station\nJR Ky\u016bsh\u016b\nKy\u016bsh\u016b Shinkansen\nHakata Station\nKagoshima Main Line\nYoshizuka Station - Hakata Station - Takeshita Station - Minami-Fukuoka Station\nSasaguri Line\nYoshizuka Station\nNishi-Nippon Railroad\nTenjin \u014cmuta Line\nZasshonokuma Station\nFukuoka City Subway\nK\u016bk\u014d Line\nNakasu-Kawabata Station - Gion Station - Hakata Station - Higashi-Hie Station - Fukuokak\u016bk\u014d Station(Fukuoka Airport)\nHakozaki Line\nNakasu-Kawabata Station - Gofukumachi Station - Chiyo-Kench\u014dguchi Station\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nHakata bus terminus (see Nishitetsu)\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nFukuoka Airport\n\n\n=== Harbor ===\nBayside place Hakata Futoh (Hakata Pier)\nCh\u016b\u014d Wharf (Central Wharf) - international ferry Beetle and Kobee and New Camellia\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Commerce ===\nCanal City Hakata\nGrand Hyatt Fukuoka\nHakata Riverain\nHakata-za\nHotel \u014ckura Fukuoka\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nLevel-5 stadium (Hakata no mori Stadium)\nFukuoka Convention Center - Marine Messe Fukuoka, Fukuoka International Congress Center, Fukuoka Kokusai Center\nHakata Civic Center, Hakata Library\nHakata South Library\nNakasu\nRakusui-en\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nShinto\nKushida Shrine\nSumiyoshi Shrine\nT\u014dka Ebisu Shrine\nBuddhism\nSh\u014dfuku Temple\nT\u014dch\u014d Temple\nJ\u014dten Temple\nS\u014dfuku Temple\nChristianity\nFukuoka Korean Christian Church, Chiyo\nHakata New Life Church,\nHikarigaoka (Hill of light) Catholic Church [1]\nMinoshima Catholic Pastoral Center.\nJapan Evangelical Lutheran church, Sasaki machi\nJapan Baptist Church, Aoki\nNorth Kyushu Japanese Orthodox Church, Higashi-hirao\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe South Korean government maintains the Korea Education Institution (Korean: \ud6c4\ucfe0\uc624\uce74 \ud55c\uad6d\uad50\uc721\uc6d0; Japanese: \u798f\u5ca1\u97d3\u56fd\u6559\u80b2\u9662) in Hakata-ku.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

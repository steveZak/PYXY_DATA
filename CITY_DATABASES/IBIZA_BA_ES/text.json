          "It was a pleasant enough experience, if you have a spare half hour but nothing too memorable. There\u2019s ample parking nearby and a lovely little gift shop, with reasonable prices, but I think the actual cave experience could have been a little cheaper for what it is. You have to",
          "It was a neat experience! Tickets were \u20ac11 for adults. Tour takes about 40 minutes max. Lots of steps on the way in and out to get to the cave.",
          "These are not anywhere as interesting or large as the caves on Mallorca, but probably worth a visit. The cave visit involves some fairly steep steps down to the entrance and a solid climb back up which could be difficult for some. The tour took much less than the advertised time",
          "Fascinating but spooky caves. Not for claustrophobics or the less than nimble. Our group was quite large so the tail enders will have missed much of what the guide had to say. It's difficult to see why smugglers favoured the intricate underground network when it could have been",
          "It has been raining with huge thunderstorms!!! The last 2 days could have been really boring here. My mum found these caves to go and see. We went for lunch in la Paloma which was great. A good kids area and friendly cats! The caves were great!!! I have a tip to the guide\ud83d\ude02",
          "very nice caves ,well worth a visit with guided tours ,however we were part of a big group and felt like we were being rushed around ,the guide doing her speeches before all the group were in hearing distance ,maybe its ok with a smaller group . the parking area is about 5 mins",
          "We visited the caves as they were so close to the hotel. Well worth a visit just to see inside them!",
          "Loved the views from this place esp looking over to the bond style villa on the peninsula. Caves are interesting and worth a visit. However not sure it was really worth 11\u20ac each and the waterfall with lights and music wasn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s taste! Warning - quite a lot of steps to",
          "If you're staying near Port de Sant Miquel, this is a place that must be visited. The excursion is cheap and offers Spanish- and English-speaking guide who will tell you the story behind this ancient cave and also make an amazing waterfall light show. On the surface there's a",
          "Well worth a visit! Interesting caves and history. The guide was very good and knowledgeable. We stayed at the Ole Galeon right next door. Also, a good cafe with amazing views. The only negative was having to have your photo taken on the way down!!",
          "We did this tour in late September, easy to find with ample parking. You buy a ticket for the tour and then the guide splits you off into groups dependent on the language you speak. The tour lasts around an hour, is well lit and the guide is funny and knowledgeable. Its a bit",
          "If you are expecting the caves of drach in Mallorca then forget it. But surprisingly these caves are a great hour visit. You get your own guide who explains everything and the views to the entrance are breathtaking! You also get a short sound and light experience. Worth a",
          "Despite the very bad commentaries that i've seen the visit was good. Not extraordinary but good. The view from the outside of the cave when we went out was very beautiful ! The inside was not very incredible, a basic cave with many many artificial things built recently and not",
          "Visited the caves because they were very close to our hotel. Tours of the caves are regular and the tour guide spoke in English, Spanish and German. The guide was very knowledgable and took time to answer questions. The caves are accessed by stairs and would not be suitable",
          "Spectacular views Fabulous cave There is a little shop to get a drink Guide really stirred our children's imagination",
          "I would say this a well priced must do attraction wherever you are on the island but certainly if you are staying close by as we were. Informative guide, nice bar/cafe and lovely cave features to walk round including an audio visual presentation towards the end.",
          "The cave as such wasn\u2019t that big, though it took approximately 15 minutes to go through it. The guide was very polite and the story that was told by him was really informative. To be honest, what I liked most of all here is not even the cave but the outstanding view on the way",
          "You pay \u20ac5 for entry to Cueva de Can Marca which includes an interesting guided tour. The cave was opened up and tunnels expanded from an age when pirates would crawl through frighteningly narrow cracks in the rock to hide contraband for sale on the black market. Mainly on local",
          "Was there yesterday, and the guide was very informative and nice. Told us the story of how this cave was used by smugglers and show us what she called \"the small buddah temple\". Totally worth it! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "it was easy to find. the coffee house were we was waiting for start of the toor was nice with nice personell. hated the coffee but the view was beatuful. Prices are like in every tourist area, but still acteptable - fe. the entry cost 11\u20ac/person. At the beginning the guide ask",
          "I love a cave! If there is a tour of caves whilst I am on holiday, I always drag my family along to visit. Having seen the caves advertised in our hotel, I was delighted! I was even more excited when we arrived at the cafe to find the views being absolutely amazing. The biggest",
          "After reading reviews I wasn't expecting much. It was on a beautiful scenic road and we found the caves easily with Google directions. \u20ac11 for adults and \u20ac7 for children. You can't do much for that money and this was a clean and tidy well run operation. We waited in cafe area",
          "We decided to go to the caves as we had an afternoon spare and it was a short walk from out hotel. Tickets were 11 euros for Adults. The views from the cafe/ gift shop/ ticketing area are wonderful, as are the views walking down to the caves. The walk down to the cave involves",
          "We visited the caves they were small but is was an enjoyable experience not be people with mobility issues due to the steps",
          "We visited the caves with an open mind after reading mixed reviews. However we certainly weren't disappointed. On arrival there is a cafe and a gift shop, with stunning views. We purchased our tickets with ease. The caves are accessed by many steps with handrails, so not",
          "Not for people with mobility issues. Lots and lots of steps down to the cave and of course up coming back. The cave itself is both beautiful and the story fascinating. Not sure \u20ac17 per adult is a fair price though. A smal cafe and souvenir shop is available the start/finish.",
          "Where to start. The entrance and gift shop is nice and clean with a stunning view over a large bay. The \u20ac11 entry fee how ever like the cliff face is a bit steep. The walk down the steps again with the stunning views and many photo opportunities is beautiful. The tour",
          "Ok so hands up should have checked google maps first before going, but as title says we never found the place, the signs are the worst i have tryed to spot,just one very faded pink arrow on the wall of a small house then what looked like nothing else, spent a hour going round in",
          "We bought a return ticked for a boat trip (Aqua Bus) from San Antony to San Miguel which included the cave visit (\u00a328/person). It worth the money. Also the staff was nice and the cave was interesting \ud83d\ude0d",
          "\u20ac11 for short cave tour. Not worth the price to be honest. A bit of waterfalls show and rocks. The tourist guide was good but thats all there is.",
          "The boat ride to San Miguel and back was really good. The staff on the boat were lovely and friendly; we even fed seagulls on our way back! The cave tour was okay. The walk up provides amazing views (including Kylie Minogue's X Factor house), so take lots of pictures here. The",
          "Great views when walking down a cliff into the cave. The cave itself is not huge, fun to see the stalactites and stalagmites, hear the story of it being used by smugglers to hide their merchandize during the Franco era, and see a small \"lights, music and water\" show at the end.",
          "This is a nice little visit The caves are interesting and it takes about 40 mins to walk around. It\u2019s a very basic tour with an amusing light show (if you have my poor sense of humour anyway) in the middle. There\u2019s a great view of the bay on the way in and I suggest you read",
          "The caves aren't very big, but we thought it was definitely worth the visit. Our 6 year old loved it too. You can't go dwelling on your own, but you have to wait for the guided tour (which is included in the entrance fee). Our guide was very good, She took the time to answer",
          "We did not go to the caves but it is possible to walk to them to the right of the beach through the hotels on the hill side people who went said they were really nice flood lit with different coloured lights but only takes 30 mins to see them. The hotel balansat do an excursion",
          "Probably slightly smaller/shorter than I expected but a nice visit and worth going to especailly if you have a car or motorbike. Plan to go on a really hot day as the caves will give you a welcome restbite from the heat. Tours last about 90 minutes",
          "A short walk uphill from San Miguel. We walked up with the staff from the hotel which gave us a slight discount. Nice cave and broke the morning up.",
          "is in area of the island with an amazing view by the cliff... otherwise its worth it to get in once in a lifetime, would be great if the \"show\" at the end of the tour would simply never happened... omg, those light effects were HORRIBLE .. maybe they were more exciting in a 60's",
          "Nice place to visit, ancient cave with a nice story. Very nice clean, calm beach next to it! Good for hald day tour",
          "Rent a car!!!!!! Amazing island off the coast of Spain. Rented a car for 60euro and easy 20 minute drive to the caves. 11euro entrance fee. Beautiful views with cafe nearby while you wait. It\u2019s a must see!",
          "We found the caves by accident .... their not the most sign posted in the world! But you defo have to go.... the tour guide is so funny!!",
          "We visited here with my son and his girlfriend. We all really enjoyed it. There are a lot of steps obviously but on the day we went an eighty four year old lady did it!!!! The tour guide was really good and funny you could tell he enjoyed his job.",
          "Sorry to say. This place is over priced for what it is. And as my daughter is 13, we had to pay adult price for her. Luckily. We were only staying a 15 minute walk away. I wouldn't have been happy if I'd travelled across the island to see this. The guide did speak in English.",
          "Visited here in May 2018. The caves were very interesting to look at inside however the tour guide that took us round seemed very disinterested and bored. The tour guide also went round the cave so quick that if you were near the back of the line you wouldn't hear a word she was",
          "Was a little sceptical about these caves as thought they might be a bit gimmicky and 11 euros for a ticket seemed a bit steep. But l have to say the caves are well worth a visit. A lot of work has gone into the caves to make them a credible attraction, with strategically placed",
          "went on the island tour, so was part of it . lots of steps , cold inside with strategically placed electric lights on man made pathways and sprayed on concrete style render on the rocks in a nice shade of cream ?.. a few steps on the pathway (but no lighting pointing to these.",
          "I've been before so knew the tour was quick but the man showing us around was awful. Couldn't have been more unfriendly and miserable if he tried. I ask him outside who owns the island in front he said \"my ex wife\" caves are lovely and cold and amazing to look at. But at 11\u20ac",
          "A long steep walk down to the cave entrance so not suitable for buggies/wheelchairs etc. The guide was very knowledgeable and gave plenty of information about the history. As others before me have said, the light/water show at the end was a little unusual. A great way to spend",
          "we did a cave walk and it amazing going in the caves we was only a 10 minute walk from them would defo recommend doing it",
          "Although it is a west view, it is just a fantastic \"get up view\" in the morning. The balconies are so private that you could be nude and still be unseen. Unfortunately, there is no excess to the water from the hotel. Was told that it could come later, as they are continuously",
          "Always like to visit a cave when we see one. This was a nice little limestone cave system and not over priced. One thing though if you don\u2019t like or can\u2019t do stairs it\u2019s not one of you.",
          "The area where the cave is located must be visited just for the beauty of it, this is free of charge. If then you can afford to spend 11\u20ac for an entertainment of about 35 minuets I would recommend you to do it. The cave is not a wonder but is a nice and interesting visit. The",
          "I read mixed reviews about this place on Tripadvisor but as always we decided to make our own minds up as it was early season and not a lot to do on Ibiza. Firstly its a great drive to it with some good coves and views. The Caves themselves are over a winding road away from the",
          "Located half way up the hill is this nice little limestone cave. Though half way fossilized you get a nice 45min tour with nice scenery inside and outside the cave!",
          "The cave is not very well kept. They built a lot around the cave and many of the stalactites are broken. The experience was particularly bad because the attitude of the guides who didn\u2019t know how to return the money to my credit card after having selected the wrong currency",
          "The cave is not very big but the views inside, at the entrance and the steps are stunning. The guiding is not too long and the visit is worth the fee of 11\u20ac. Do not miss it if you are around. Goid place to cool!",
          "Arrived about 1 pm and told next visit would be at 2pm. There is a little cafe and a gift shop. Admission costs \u20ac11 ( basically \u00a311) per person, no consessions. No one tells you about the dozens of steps down the cliff face to get to the cave mouth. The tour guide does his best",
          "We arrived 1025am and they open at 1030am so we got into the first group of visitors - the ticket seller lady also does serve a very nice cuppa coffee whilst you wait too! When they opened the gate you started walking down a lot a lot of stairs - all very clean and neat with",
          "We went here on a late afternoon excursion from Portinatx (one of those 'train rides', pleasant enough). Entrance is 11 Euro - not cheap but hey, you're on holiday. To get to the caves you have to go on a terrifying walkway down the cliff - gorgeous view of the bay but if you're",
          "We stayed in Port de San Miguel, & walked to the caves. The view walking down to the cave enterance is lovely. Caves are nothing exciting.",
          "This excursion has quite a lot of steps down so that means you have to climb them coming back up but fewer on the way back. we enjoyed this little trip as we love nature.",
          "We got home 2 days ago from Ibiza. We expected a lot more from the caves than what we saw although it was quite interesting. The whole cave tour took about 40 minutes with some interesting sights. The light show at the waterfall was not bad but a bit spoilt by the fact that the",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way for this.......the best part in my opinion is the walk along the cliff getting to the caves, as the view is gorgeous! We were a part of a large tour group, so we clogged up the cave - however, the staff should be prepared for this, and they really",
          "Wasn't that impressed, I appreciate no flash photography to be taken in the cave but what was the need for the tazer light show I'm not sure, not worth going out of your way for, might be good for children if you are staying in the area. The water flowing was turned on by a tap",
          "loads of steps but kids loved it the light show at the end is very good great information about the smugglers",
          "We visited in September as the cave had been recommended. You have to wait for a tour after paying and then make your way down the cliff side steps which have an impressive view over the adjacent sea and bay. Your photo is taken on the way down so they can try to sell you it at",
          "First off, the caves themselves were pretty impressive. Caution: watch your head at all times and be aware that the floor can be very, very slippery. We had a guide with us at all times and there was plenty of lighting the entire time, but it was still pretty dark at certain",
          "One star is a little harsh as the caves are stunningly beautiful but sadly the experience was spoilt by rude staff and a badly organised tour. The group was far too large and crammed in to a very confined area, there was only 1 guide and we were so far away from her we didn't",
          "We went there on a rainy day. The trip to the cave was nice. The tickets are \u20ac11,- per person. You have to wait until there are enough tourists so you go by group. The waiting takes the most of the time. There is a climb down and when finished it's a climb up so if you are not",
          "on a very hot day the caves were lovely to see and the water fall inside was amazing really need to visit",
          "I love this place and part of the island. It's a fabulous, small little village with everything you need.",
          "With the Caves being a simple 5 minute walk away from our hotel, the Ole Galeon, my boyfriend and I decided to go to the caves. The tour was around 45 minutes long and cost \u00a311 which I didn't think was particularly bad - if you know you're not spending a whole day there it's",
          "We loved these caves. There's great views of Port San Miquel as you walk downto the caves. On a hot day it's wonderful to be inside the cold of the caves. The tour was perfect - informative, but not verbose! Great caves and well done. Good for all ages. The paths are uneven",
          "This was an unplanned visit. We saw the Grotte Hole (cave) signposted on the way to the North and thought we would give it a go. It was fab, a very cool mini exploration with an informative guide and worth a visit if you're in the area. There were quite a few young children and",
          "Overall ..40 mins tour involving a lot if steps but fine for small kids if can walk any distance..forget it if pram or walki g aids. Nice little cafe area. Can be donw in flip flops ..not cold in caves. Worth the \u20ac36 for 2 adults and 2 kids  (under 12! ? ) only if stuck for",
          "We were recommended this tour by our rep so decided to do it. It is very steep with a lot of steps so not good if you have difficulties with walking. When we got to the bottom of the steps where the entrance off there was a power cut. We were told we could go back up all of the",
          "Whilst we enjoyed the guided tour and the history of the cave, we expected natural waterfalls accompanied with a light show. What we got was stage managed by someone flicking a switch to turn the waterfall on, a nice bit of music and some flashing lights. A little bit",
          "Booked this trip with our Jet2holidays rep. Wasn't sure what to expect, but what a beautiful place to visit, well worth it. I must stress though, it's not a trip for the less able as I didn't notice any wheelchair access and not recommended if you have trouble with your legs and",
          "Seen better caves in Derbyshire and Somerset. Lots of steps to get to the caves. The fountain and coloured water are turned on at the flick of a switch, not naturally occurring.",
          "To get there we took the car train from Portinax. On arrival at the caves there was a man playing a didgeridoo which was a bit random. When purchasing the tickets the gentleman behind the counter was rather curt. That aside the guide was very good, quickly switching between",
          "We went as part of a cruise ship excursion, so the cave was congested and seeing some of the cave was blocked by the large crowd. The water flowing, music playing, and light show is staged. If you have never been in an underground cave, then this is a good starter cave. There's",
          "40 minute experience - 11 euros for an adult and 7 for a child. Narration was interesting and helpful.",
          "Cost \u20ac11 each and \u20ac7 for children. Its a lot for what it is and they turn the waterfall on when your they. Not good for disabled people as there are a lot of steps. Some beautiful little lakes etc",
          "Family of 5, visted the caves and was great to see, great view from on way into cave, the guide was polite and informative.",
          "Great location and the view is worth the trip. Caves are good an worth a visit although 11 Euros does seem a little pricey. Would still advise a visit though.",
          "It was a very quick trip for us. Took a boat from San Paolo then a mini bus to the cave. We had one hour to complete the guided tour but we made it on time. Get ready for climbing a lot of stairs! The tour guide presented the cave in 4 languages, we took nice picture inside and",
          "11\u20ac for visiting a cave. El Prado museum cost 15\u20ac. It's a fraud. However the landscape from the bar is amazing. It worth it.",
          "Small but interesting cave on the cliff tops of San Miguel. 5 minutes walk from the Ole Galeon hotel. Beautiful views of the bay on the way in, lovely cafe with views at the start finish and interesting tour of the small caves. Although not spectacular caves, interesting, worth",
          "Cost \u20ac11 per adult. 300 steps to get down to entrance, taken by a guide. Views from the steps are beautiful! Tour took about 40 minutes. Slow progress up steps again. I had to use my torch on my phone to see the path inside as its quite dark in places, and felt a bit unsteady.",
          "Shortly said, it's not worth it and it's terribly overpriced as well. First we had to wait way too long, second was that our group was way too big for the small ways, as many persons per run as possible. Last but not least; the guide was talking spanish on 75% of the tour, which",
          "This is more or less the view we had all the time from our hotel. Beach and immediate surrounds weren't much so probably not worth going out of your way for. But such a view and there is a Tower one side and caves the other.",
          "The views are breathtaking but the staff was horrible or should I say the gentleman who was locking up the facility was a nightmare. Mr. Meanie is what I will refer to him as for the duration of this review. He told us that when we finished the tour we will be allowed to",
          "We stayed at the nearby resort and walked (about 10 minutes) to the caves from one of the hotels. Nice little cafe there and was quite popular. There are wonderful views whilst we waited for our tour. Tours ran every 30 minutes when we were there and were split into different",
          "Tours run every 30 minutes, our guide spoke mostly in Spanish and then at the end did a very basic summary in English. You basically walk through the caves and then at the end there is an artificial light and water show. The caves have been tweaked quite a lot with added water",
          "When we was first in Ibiza we visited the cave and so we returned to Ole Galeon Hotel(near by the cave) the following year, because we liked the landscape, the surroundings.",
          "We came across this by mistake.You have an hour wait between cave viewings which happen on the hour. We enjoyed this a lot. This wouldn't be ideal for someone with disabilities or who can hike up and down stairs on the side of a cliff. Ideal for kids, families of all ages,",
          "We visited the caves because the weather wasn't great and we wanted to find something to do that was undercover. They are in a beautiful location. Staff were really good at catering to different nationalities (languages) and they were informative about the caves history. We",
          "We drove across the island to visit these caves, on arrival we were just in time of the start of a guided tour. This attraction is not for anyone who has mobility problems as it is down lots of stairs before you enter them, the path inside is very dim and then afterwards you",
          "Breath Taking Views, lots of stairs, beautiful inside, musical and color changing fountain, tickets at reasonable price, easy to get to.",
          "Waste of money. Waited over an hour for the tour to start, the tour was over in about 25 minutes, complete waste of time and money. No real tour as such just a guided walk with not much information. Very commercialised, the coloured lights in the waterfall were pretty. Even the",
          "The caves are a 10 minute walk from Hotel Club Cartago, loads of steps but we walked through this with two young kids and flip flops on. Plenty to see, reasonably priced. It's fairly short, it's not an all day excursion, it lasts for about 45 minutes. We had a nice walk and a",
          "The views from the cafe and the steps down the cliffs to the cave entrance are lovely. The gentleman guide who led our tour spoke with a strong Spanish accent and it wasn't always easy to hear what he said. But one of the things he did say was that the caves are always around 18",
          "worth going to see the caves, nice little walk up and excursion into the caves. nothing too long winded, took an hourish we expected it to take up half the day but it didnt",
          "Me and my girlfriend visited Oct 2016 and it was ok but not worth twenty Euros, we took a late visit and there was no other people on our tour, the lady who took us was lovely and very informative with good English.... we stayed in a hotel just a five minutes walk away so it",
          "Not for those not good on their feet. We walked from our hotel at the bottom of the hill. Once you get there you have to walk down approx 80 steps down to the caves . Once in there's a short dark walk but s lovely water display at the end. Then it's back up all the steps again.",
          "We booked the 'Love Ibiza' trip through First Choice. An experience where we got to see the island, hear the history and visit San Antonia and the Caves at Can Marca. We were looking forward to seeing the caves. we were slightly disappointed. Lots of steps down & back up and the",
          "This is set at the top of a beautiful cliff at San Miguel cove. The view is spectacular but the cave tour is average. It could've been better if there were less people. Worth a visit, but average. Quite a few steps too so bear it in mind when planning to go.",
          "As part of my holiday in Ibiza with friends, we all decided we would like to go see the caves. Having been to a few cave trips in the UK we were all quite excited to go. We go to the place and purchased our tickets having only needing to wait 15mins before the next tour set",
          "Went to see the caves as part of an excursion. Nice stop off and a reasonable price. It's a steep walk down a lot of steps and half way down they will try and take your picture to sell to you after the trip through the cave. You take a guided tour around the cave, the cave",
          "You can visit the coves, to have to take a steep stone stairway to the entrance gate of the cove, the cove it self is small, there is a nice light and music show (cascade), duration about 15- 20 minutes.",
          "I enjoyed this trip. It was very interesting and made a nice change from the usuual activities most people do on the island. The guide spoke a range of languages and the price to visit was reasonable.",
          "It's a cave visit. The tour guide spoke to us in all languages so everybody could understand. Gave us details how the smugglers that hoarded their contraband got around and the dangers they faced. After going through there is a light water show at the end. Overall the tour is",
          "Well worth a visit to these caves, great tour guide lot's of history and well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Visited in August, great views but lots of steps. Wasn't too long inside caves but I think any longer would be boring. The guide spoke in a few languages and was informative.",
          "Good views from entrance. Tourist guide was very good and filled with knowledge. Waterfall was stunning!",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect as this was part of a larger tour. I enjoyed this more than I expected. The inside of the cave is stunning and the light effects and music really were lovely. I thought it was a good tour with interesting information. The steps up and down to the",
          "This is not suitable if you have any difficulties in walking as there a LOT of stairs to get down to entrance and the you have to get back to top through the cave system, it must have been a busy time as we had to wait before being led down to entrance and then crammed in like",
          "Once you have seen the start of the cave you have pretty much seen the whole cave. The tour was quite crowded, slow and not very interesting. Some rock formations, no natural water and very little information given. Would I go again? No. Would I recommend a visit? If it is",
          "We visited the caves while visiting the island. The tour lasted around 35 minutes and cost slightly over 10 euros for an adult. The tour was interesting and on the day was available in English, Spanish and Dutch. However it did get slightly boring and I have seen better caves in",
          "The caves themselves are great and the views around stunning.There are a lot of steps to get to the actual caves both in and out and up and down - so if you struggle up the stairs, give it a miss! What could have been a nice experiences was totally ruined by the sheer number of",
          "Interesting visit. Not the most spectacular caves I have visited but a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The guide is amusing and informative. The views across the bay are stunning and make the whole experience worthwhile. Worth a trip. Not accessible to the less able",
          "Don't expect too much, it's 30 mins there's not much to see. Try and avoid going in the heat of the day. The guide dies his best.",
          "Very interesting experience. Firstly it was warm down there as the rocks absorb the heat of the sun. Timed visits which last 40 minutes after entry into the cave.. 10 Euros 50 entry fee. Quite a compact area so not miles to walk. Not suitable for the less abled. Super rock",
          "we visited the caves for the first trip of the day at 10.30am it was just 5-10 min walk from our hotel and was nice to see something a little different for a while, it was a nice constant temperature 18-20 and to see some of the rock formations was nice, are a few steps down and",
          "I think if you have a morning free on the island it's certainly worth a visit. The guide is full of information and can speak any language you can think of. The tour last roughly an hour and really is interesting. Be aware though, there are a lot of steps. The views when",
          "We took a walk from our hotel up to the cave... you pay 11 euros each and you are taken round by a guide... there's a bit of a light show with music and water falls but that's about it.",
          "We visited here during our holiday in July. It was interesting with all the history of the caves explained. It's not too long which suited our kids and kept their attention.",
          "We have arrived for the first scheduled tour but were told that it will start half an hour later. The whole experience would have been so much more enjoyable if the staff was more client focused and inviting. We felt like intruders and the entrance ticket wasn't the cheapest!",
          "We had seen some pictures of the caves on line and also dotted around the island. Having hired a car we decided to have a drive out and have a look. So this place is a little hard to find, one you get really close it is well sign posted but to get to that stage took some good",
          "Been to loads of caves and these ones were one of my favourites, with stunning views walking to them and inside they were beautiful.",
          "Good to see how the old days of smuggling went on, lots of steps to encounter enjoyable visit lots of knowledgeable facts from tour guide in different languages.",
          "We visited here as part of a full excursion. I wouldn't make the trip out here especially. The caves themselves are ok, but if you've visited caves in other countries this is nothing different. They are quite small and only took about 10 minutes to get around. The 'light show'",
          "Pleasant trip, quiet interesting, good guide and well organised, he spoke all the languages. Lots of steps and a bit clostrophobic. Was 10Euros and we walked to it so didnt incur transport costs. I enjoyed but wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't been staying nearby.",
          "Look - this is a great little place to take the kids and get out of the bestow few hours but it's not as magnificent as some cave complexes. Not suitable for those without full Mobility and some smaller kids might be a little afraid of the enclosed spaces but the light show is",
          "Came in as were passing. The tours only run every hour but we timed it right and only had to wait 15 mins. Quite pricey to get in and only takes about 30 minutes. You get a guided 'tour' in different languages and it's all quote man made. No way as good as places like Cueva de",
          "Nice place to cool down on a hot day Lots of steps and uneven pathways Guide wasn't the most helpful we have had. She ran round the caves a rushed away",
          "Lovely to see the caves, great experience, but not for those with walking difficulties or asthmatics as there are some 150 steps to go down! Great experience though.",
          "Lovely trip with the kids. I have 1yr old 5 yr and 8yr. They loved it. We had our 1yr in a carrier but you can definitely free carry a baby. Amazing views of the cave, we loved it.",
          "As a family of 5 we enjoyed the caves. But the children did get a little bored. I think older children would be more appreciative.",
          "Great place to visit if you are planning half a day trip. You can be back for the party well ahead of time. We took a bus from Ibiza town to reach the place. I guess during certain times of the year there is a ferry to San Antonio. If you are travelling by the local bus it's",
          "We were staying within walking distance of the caves so thought we would visit. Lovely inside but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't recommend it for people who have walking difficulties.",
          "Cova de Can Marca : not that big cove. compared with others around the world but worth a quick visit. Not realy a must do.",
          "I visited here with my boyfriend in may 2016, we had spent a couple of days figuring out how to get here ourselves, the buses were only running two days a week and not very often! So we decided to hire a car and I'm so glad we did, this place was easy to find once in San Miguel",
          "Our guide turned up late looking and acting like she had been partying in San Antonio all night and we were depriving her of her bed!! We were then ushered quickly through a series of uninteresting \"smugglers caves\" while being given some sort of commentary which no one could",
          "Well worth a visit, a real hidden gem. A bit awkward if you are not steady on your feet. Lots of stairs. The caves are really beautiful and the light and sound part is worth the entry fee alone.",
          "Sant Miguel is a beautiful part of the island and the caves are well worth a visit if you are in the area. There is a fairly steep climb before you get to the top of the cliff then a lot of stairs that take you to the caves. Although the steps are very sturdy and secure I",
          "We decided to pay a visit to this cave, drove all the way up the hill, parked and walked downhill to the ticket office. Upon arrival we found at least 20 people already waiting and the next tour not leaving for 50 minutes. How many more would have arrived by then? We were not",
          "It is interesting for kids. They enjoy the light show there and the cove's atmosphere. The viewpoint before entering the cove offers good photos",
          "These caves are beautiful. The walk down to the caves is well worth it, amazing coastal views as you climb stairs down to cave entrance. Once inside you will not be disappointed and the light show is the icing on the cake! Brilliant tour guide. In the summer this will",
          "Well worth a visit on a trip to Ibiza, well maintained and excellently run, the tour guide was brilliant. Very informative, naturally beautiful and a welcome cool down from the heat of the sun!",
          "I come from a country, With many caves, but I still like to visit them. What I liked the most about this caves is the efort. This is a river cave, but it is dried out, so they are artificially keeping it wet, so that the cave does not colapse. Also the story around it is",
          "Great morning trip, friendly staff and very informative. Lovely simple cafe with plenty if refreshments and gifts.",
          "We visited here on an excursion from Portnatix which was a boat trip to Puerto de San Miguel, transport and entry to the Caves for about \u20ac18. Entrance for adults is about \u20ac10.50 for the tour. The tour lasts about an hour and is definitely worth the experience of the delightful",
          "We stayed in San Miguel so it seemed silly not to visit with the caves just being round the corner really. You get very nice views from the wee terrace where you can enjoy a drink. The tour itself takes about half an hour I think and I found it pretty interesting to see. Not as",
          "The caves were okay, but personally I didn't think they were anything that special. I have visited the Caves of Drach in Majorca and maybe was expecting something like those. I wouldn't recommend them.",
          "Visited the caves as we were staying nearby. Fantastic views as you walk down the steps to them. The caves themselves are small but have some nice stalactites and stalagmites in them. The guide was really interesting and told stories of smugglers.",
          "caves are well worth a visit but I struggles with all the stairs to get to them especially on the way up. Overall, nice couple of hours spend viewing the caves there is. an entrance fee of 10euros per adult thow",
          "Interesting cave and was not overly disappointed in spite of the negative comments on other reviews. Expense was not terrible. Looking back I would not recommend for a separate trip if you are far away.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to the caves.guide was good, 200 steps to get down into the cave and 100 steps to get back to the top, hard work! Great light show at the end.",
          "These caves were only a short walk from where we were staying in Port San Miguel. Once used by smugglers, they are a accessed by many steps and so it is not suitable for anyone with mobility issues. Inside there are beautiful rock formations including fluorescing pools of",
          "Tour felt rushed and overpriced , 10.50 euro for half hour tour. The views from here are amazing . Little cafe in a perfect spot too .",
          "Situated a short walk from our hotel, Ole Galleon, this was our first foray into the tourist attractions of this part of Ibiza. And it was fascinating if only for the linguistic skills of our guide who seemed to switch effortlessly between 4 or 5 languages. The caves are well",
          "great views and lovely caves ,tour guide was excellent,not for the frail or elderly as there are a lot of stairs,",
          "Fab caves to explore on foot - guided tours take you down the outside of the cliffs via a staircase and into the caves, which are well lit to effect and were once used by smugglers. The caves themselves are easy to navigate, but the stairs to and from the entrance would be",
          "Worth a visit but not the most spectacular caves. Limited in size, but quite well presented with some clever lighting effects, and an informative guide.",
          "Popped in here on an Island Tour. The guide had too many people to deal with and we should have been split into two groups. The stories about the pirates and how they used the caves were impressive and to see how the caves were formed by the water was also very interesting. The",
          "Small and easy cave to get around in. It is a cave in a cliff with a waterfall show with strobe lights and tiny rock pools. The pools with fluoride looked cool under the lights. The instructor was multi lingual and very friendly.",
          "we went here on our own and payed 21 euro for two adults it was only a short walk from club san migual where we stayed it was ok but theirs loads of steps to go down to get in and back up when you come out some very nice views thu from the cliff side looking over the port of san",
          "A long walk up steep hill, so do drive. Once there, do expect to see some magnificent views of the surrounding area. Allow time to rest and use the facilities before starting the cave tour. Tour take about 35 minutes and you need to be in good shape, as there are 100's of stairs",
          "when on holiday we like to visit any where there are some caves so we were looking forward to this visit , the caves are shown in tours every 45min and you are separated into your language groups and then taken down some steep steps, you then have to wait until your group can",
          "They were ok but got soaked through walking up the side of the hill as it was raining so hard, we were holding onto a metal handrail whilst there was thunder and lightening which was quite frightening. Once in the caves the women who worked there were so miserable, telling kids",
          "We visited these caves on a trip by land train from Portinatx. The caves are down a long flight of steps but they are well worth the effort. Our group was rather large so we were not able to see all of the caves but we were. wry impressed with those we did see. The formations",
          "Visited with two boys 8 & 9 yrs old. Well signed posted to caves with plenty of free parking. Only guided tours available every 45mins. \u20ac10.50 adult. \u20ac6.50 children. Infants free. We got reduced prices by buying in advance from our hotel. Approx 320 steps down from",
          "got some free tickets but dont think I would have been happy with the Caves if I had paid for a family ticket. We used them on an overcast day so it passed some time. Low point was the waterfall where there was a guy frantically switching switches to give a light show.",
          "It's interesting & set out well but the tour guide spent most of the time talking in Spanish then very briefly translated in English, we were then moved on. It could've been better.",
          "A really great hour or so off the beaten track that the kids can get into, the guide was great to involve the kids letting them know about the pirates being chased through the caves and there was even a light and water show for them to into. Although there are a lot of steps up",
          "5 minute walk from the Ole Galeon hotel. Great for a morning out. The kids loved the fact it was an old pirates cave!",
          "for only about \u00a330 for a family of four, an interesting couple of hours, with some good lighting effects and a very informative guide who spoke excellent English",
          "Interesting visit and guide does his best to make it interesting in a few different languages including a light and water display. Takes around 45 mins and costs \u20ac13 ish for adults and \u20ac10 for 5's and over. If you're getting there on foot from sant Miquel beach it is a fair trek",
          "Took 40 mins and was quite expensive seemed like u was in 5 mins plus had loads of steps to get into cave and all round cave was steps,",
          "We booked this trip thinking we were going to the caves then being taken to a beach for 2 hours before going home. Wrong!! The company no longer go to the beach (brochures not up to date) and offer a free drink and saucer of nuts when you come out of the caves instead. The",
          "Takes about 30/40mins to walk round. There is a lovely man who explains all about its interesting history. Definitely worth the walk up the hill",
          "The caves tour benefits from two separate parts, first: The walk to the caves - on the walk you get some absolutely stunning views of San Miguel which are well worth taking your camera for. There's a lot of steps on the way down to the caves which have been updated recently, so",
          "Beautiful caves in a beautiful setting - they won't be the largest caves you will have seen but the smuggler stories and the helpful guide really make this a lovely couple of hours. Beware there are a huge amount of steps descending down the side of the cliff but it is worth",
          "You can visit the largest cove on Ibiza by climbing around 300 steps! It\u00b4s worth seeing, but the enterence fee is a little bit high (9.50 adults and 6,- for the kids).",
          "Interesting caves. Well marked as you arrive in town. Tour is about 30 mins and you might have to wait for the next one. Not spectacular, but a welcome relief from the heat About 30 euros entrance fee for a family of 4 Loads of steps; hard work for those who less movie or have",
          "The views of the cove are beautiful. There are many stairs down to the entrance of the caves and more stairs inside so this tour may not be suitable if you have restricted mobility. Once in the cave the tour guide tells you a little bit of history about the caves then you are",
          "Decided on a visit as we were staying close by. The caves are very pretty, the tour takes around 30-40 minutes the guide speaks in all languages so you can understand the history.",
          "The caves are interesting with their history of smuggling but I'm not sure about the necessity of the artificial waterfall & green coloured pools. The waterfall is switched on as the group arrives, lasts too long then switched off again which in my view detracts from the overall",
          "We enjoyed this visit. The views from the steps leading to the caves are spectacular and the caves themselves are interesting. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The cave itself, ok-ish. Mallorca has many more caves that are also beautyfull. The rocky path to the cave entrace is breath taking for people who hate heights, and as well as people who do not care about heights",
          "Good value visit to the caves - interesting way to spend the morning! Nice cafe for a cool drink after the tour of the caves.",
          "The temperature was very high the week of our visit and the caves maintain a steady 19 degrees year round. The caves were interesting, but it's all over in about half an hour.",
          "Enjoyed the views before entering these caves. Lots of steps, but plenty of hand-rails to help anybody with a slight wobble. Small but interesting, glad to have visited.",
          "The cave itself is dry and not really impressive. A few water features were added artificially. I've seen a lot more impressive caves in my life. However, the views from the entrance to the caves were wonderful.",
          "We went on the love ibiza tour which was great apart from the cave tour This was the worst guided tour i have been on. The guide was the problem as he just didn't make any attempt to guide. We had a two min talk and then he just ignored us. We also had to wait outside",
          "Good place to visit while your in porto san Miguel. Takes about an hour or so to walk round the caves. lovely light effects. The kids loved it.",
          "Visited with my husband on a Chilli morning was a good way to spend a few hours. Priced at 10,50 the tour took approx 45 minutes. The guide was very knowledgable and explained everything to Spanish and English. They have made some cool tricks in there with lights and water. If",
          "We were looking for something to do on an overcast day, and this fitted the bill. It's about 30 mins from San Antonio by car. Access to the caves is down a lengthy path and stairs, so not suitable for those with restricted mobility, (or very tall!). Don't expect to go straight",
          "We decided to walk ourselves from our hotel it was fairly easy although lots and lots of steps! The caves were fascinating, the guide gave us the history and the lighting and freshwater display was amazing. A cheap morning or afternoon out and the view if the bay is breath taking",
          "the views outside on the way to the cave entrance are very nice. the cave itself is not really worth the visit, unless you have kids that want to have a nice attaction. expected the trip to take at least twice as long, as the entrance fee was not low.",
          "Nothing too spectacular to see, but worth a look if you're nearby. A few smallish caverns with some nice formations. At one point, the guide turns on a pump to cause a waterfall, and there's a few coloured lights and strobes. Naff, but effective. They've also painted a few",
          "I don't understand the other reviews complaining about this place. It's a tourist attraction on Ibiza not the Grand Canyon. It's easy to find and has a large car park. A lot of work has gone into these caves to make them accessible to all but the disabled & the infirm. There are",
          "this was a great place to visit, you will need water and be able to walk up and down stairs, a camera with no flash. The caves are well lit, and the guide is informative, it costs about 10.50 euros to get in.",
          "We recently stayed in Ibiza and heard about these caves so decided to visit. They are situated San Miguel in Ibiza. It cost \u20ac10.50 for an adult and we did not have to wait long for the next tour. You are presented the caves by a tour guide who took Spanish speaking visitors",
          "great little trip a few steps involved to say the very least, nice little light show at the as well.",
          "We were staying at the First Choice Holiday Village in Port Des Torrent ans caught the Aqua Bus from the beach to the caves. It cost 18 euros per adult and 10 euros per child, The boat trip took 90 minutes to reach the beach by the cave, we then boarded a minibus for a very",
          "The kids enjoyed it but I thought it was a little pricey, for short walk but Im glad I did it. Not suitable for people with walking difficulties.",
          "We took the bus from another resort here as we had visited 10 years ago and wanted to take some friends. The bus stops near the cave entrance to save the walk up the hill! There seemed to be tours every half hour. So we plumped down on a table and chairs with the most gorgeous",
          "Beautiful caves, stunning location. really great trip, Worth a visit. Although some of the commentary was a little difficult to understand and it may be difficult for the less mobile",
          "We walked to these caves from balansat torremar apartments, and it was a bit of a trot, all uphill with kids. It was thankfully not too long though. The price was ok, 10.50e for adults and 6e for kids. Place to sit and have a drink whilst waiting for tour guide, with a small",
          "We visited the caves as part of the mini train excursion and was not pre warned that we would have to pay an extra 10.50 Euros each if we wanted to enter the caves. As our party mainly consisted of Germans our guide to the caves decided that they would go first and that he would",
          "I agree with others who say it is not worth the money. It was badly organised, the guide split us into groups according to nationality and then kept changing her mind who she wanted to speak to first. If I had paid 5 euro I would have been happy, but at 10.50 each it was a rip",
          "We had hired a car for two days and could not find many attractions to visit other than beaches. We had read about these caves on trip advisor so knew what to expect..Little bit hard to find but when we got there we found a large car park and 3 or 4 minutes walk to where you pay",
          "Went to see the caves, drove ourselves, interesting but not gripping, our guide seemed more interested in telling people off for talking pictures with a flash than making it more interesting. A bit of enthusiasm would have helped. Glad I've seen it, but would have been a bit",
          "Interesting enough series of caves, worth a short visit while on holiday in Ibiza, but truthfully not as good as similar sites elsewhere, for example the Caves of Drac in Majorca. We were staying in nearby Puerto St Miguel, so the caves were within a ten minute walk from our",
          "One of the few proper visitor attractions on the island, this was situated in northern Ibiza, close to the delightful seaside town of Port de San Miguel. We arrived at opening time- however, the man in the ticket office/bar seemed bored and fed up with visitors already, and was",
          "I would urge people not to waste their money! We sat bored waiting on our tour then had more waiting as we were split into groups based on language, the actual caves seem to be mostly man made now and the light show at the end was pointless, the waterfall is man made the lights",
          "Nice attraction learnt about the history of the caves which was interesting .the trip was quite rushed not much time to take photos .it would have been nice to go it alone rather than having a guide for the whole tour ..the light show was good but not if your epilectic as theres",
          "These caves aren't much more than a tourist trap. The caves themselves have been given \"additions,\" such as glowing green pools and a waterfall light show. Even with these \"improvements,\" there really isn't much to see. Also, if you are expecting these caves to be big, you're in",
          "We visited to caves after seeing a brochure with a free map of ibiza, we arrived and eventually found a parking place. There is a small gift ( tack) shop and cafe where you buy your 10 euro ticket the man with the obligatory ( old hat) pony tail who served me, he was very",
          "if you suffer from Epilepsy and or flashing lights, be well aware that the man made waterfall halfway round suddenly without warning, starts very rapidly flashing with very bright white lights worse than in a disco, -you are not warned before, or on entry! .....and I didn't see",
          "Just in the middle of a cliff above the Mediterranean there is that cave, discovered by smugglers at the beginning of the 19th century. It's beautiful inside, and gives a short brake from the intensive clubbing/parties atmosphere out there.",
          "Very interesting tour in understandable English. Very pretty show with the waterfall and colourful light display. Quite a lot of steps down to start the tour but ok if you are mobile. Photos taken and printed for when you have finished. No obligation to buy but they were good",
          "After reading previous reviews I feel the need to redress the balance as my family (children age 9 and 10) and I really enjoyed our visit. There was a short wait at the top while the guide sorted everyone into nationalities, which worked well as once we were down in the caves",
          "We were very disappointed in this trip. The views from the top are spectacular however the tour within the cave was very poor. We only managed to catch a few parts of the tour in English. There was a man made water display set to music and lights however that part only lasted 5",
          "It's one of those places where once you've seen it, that's it. We missed the English tour guide and got mingled in with the Germans, although the guide was nice enough to give us a quick description of what we was seeing separately. It was good to see how naturally the shape of",
          "This is a nice visit although a bit expensive for what it is. The guide explained it well and had some interesting stories. The light and water show at the end was quite impressive. Yes, worth a visit!",
          "Well where do I start, the leaflets look great and was a great journey by car from Ibiza old town, however the \u20ac10 it cost each adult to go and see, I was thinking wow this is going to be great. The Views around from the top before climbing down the stairs to the cave was",
          "great cave really beautiful, however they are rushing you in and out - and also taking too many in - they put people in groups of what language they spoke - and we being 2 of the 4 british were put at the back - rather than wait for you to come along - the guide would just talk",
          "There's very little to make the entrance fee to this site worthwhile. Caves can often be interesting and significant places to visit, and this site could have some potential, but the visit is chaotic, crowded and somewhat opportunistic. There were far too many people queuing to",
          "The attraction would have been nice to see if it was in its natural state. However it had been a bit \"blinged up\" with coloured lights and \"fake\" water that they had running through it. The guide didn't hide the fact that most of it was fake or enhanced in some way. Also the",
          "View from cafe was amazing over the bay. Disappointed by the cave tour. Too many people, too many languages.",
          "Caves very interesting & reasonable value for 10 euros. Be prepared to wait for entry, you have to go round with a guide & though they give a time for the next tour they change it at will if there are not enough people. The views a great, while you wait though! There were about",
          "Tour guide was friendly, but after hearing the same tale of smugglers 4times you realise that the tour doesn't have much substance, if you have to do the tour, go through your hotel, which will have a set day and they will give you a discount",
          "We travelled on the Ibiza Express which was organised by Thomson. The train is lovely and we enjoyed the countryside and also looking out o sea where we could see Majorca 200km away. I felt a bit hurried as I descended and ascended the steps to and from the cave. The caves",
          "Well worth a visit although not for those with reduced mobility or epilepsy. The tour guide was very friendly and spoke several different languages. Didn't feel rushed through and no pressure to purchase merchandise. A very relaxed trip with breathtaking views.",
          "It's a great escape area for those who actually want to see something rather than just party 24/7. I really enjoyed the trip to the cave itself. Not too long, about 30 minutes. And white walking, you can actually feel that this is something that makes you shiver - the cave is",
          "Absolutely loved the caves! The views were amazing! Cost 10euros per person and well worth it! Easy to walk to from our apartments ( Balanzat) - if you are up for walking up the hill :)",

          "Be ready to climb up :) castle is on a top of a hill and to get there have to walk like 15-20min up. Ibiza weather makes it hard but a view worth it. Free activity for all ages (on a wheelchair it will be very hard to get there,plus I did not see any disabled people there).",
          "I was glad we went on a slightly over cast day! It is knackering getting to the top but the views over Ibiza town are beautiful. I actually enjoyed the journey the most (more so the way down), there were so many hidden spots where the flowers were taking over the sides of houses",
          "Well worth the climb to the top as the view was amazing take a towel and water in summer as it is very hot and sweaty",
          "Very steep but worth the hike. Once your at the top the view is stunning. Little shops pepper the hill so you can stop off for refreshments",
          "Loved our walk around Ibiza town and especially the views from the top. 100% worth the climb, one of the best parts of our holiday.",
          "Excellent castle, but from my point of view is very interesting all the route you go to reach the castle, you have a lot to see. Attention goes up quite a lot, so you have comfortable shoes and water.",
          "A must see. A bit hot walking to the top but definitely worth it \ud83d\ude04 Get views all across Ibiza as you walk around.",
          "We walked from the very top of Dalt Vila where the cathedral bells were ringing down past the castle with its rooms with cannons in and big defence walls. Lovely walk down with lots of shops to browse and cafes for a snack or drink. From the castle you can see Ibiza town the",
          "I visited this castle during a three day stay in Ibiza. It was a really cool spot and was surrounded by cute village homes and buildings. Took some photos and read all the historical info! Definitely check it out.",
          "The outer ramps around the fortifications were our route of choice - take plenty of water! We went on a Monday and some of the museums were closed. Anyway, this is a must do visit to appreciate the vistas which await you at the top. Then meander down the streets in search of",
          "Very steep slopes, especially careful when wet, lots to see and great vista views from the top. Lots of quaint shops and little bars and restaurants.",
          "Stunning views from the top of the old city. Quite a steep climb and slippy in places so be careful, even in the dry. Food and drink available half way up but as expected quite pricey. The church is beautiful and a great place to reflect (and cool off) well worth the walk",
          "Went for a day into Ibiza town on the local bus was really nice had a great walk around the castell de Eivissa steep in places and slippery path even with no rain so wear very comfy shoes but what fantastic views of the surrounding area. A must if you going to Ibiza town stopped",
          "The barmen in our resort told us to head to Ibiza Old Town because there was a medieval festival in the castle. It was fabulous. There were stalls selling food, ceramics, jewellery etc. There was a jousting match as we approached the castle which was very well done. The views",
          "When on holiday we went here for a day out we timed it just right as there was a festival on at the time the place has great historical significance and lots to see would recommend it to anyone to go and visit this place",
          "We climbed to the top and what a view, they were setting the top up for a fiesta and bet it would have been awesome. Very steep in place and stones a bit slippery in places.",
          "The term \u2018Ibiza\u2019 or \u2018Evissa\u2019 in Spanish comes from the Arabic word \u2018Yabisah\u2019 meaning \u2018fortified.\u2019 The evidence of the Moorish fortifications can be seen throughout the Island. No more so than the \u2018Castell.\u2019 The views are spectacular. On a clear day you can see Formentera in the",
          "This huge fortress is a great monument to Spanish history perched on the hill. Its a steep climb but worth it with plaques in English to explain the history The views across the bay and harbour are stunning.",
          "It's most definitely well worth the walk up to the Castle. The views are amazing, looking across to the islands or down to the port.",
          "We enjoy in beautiful views in all directions. Castel is on the hilltop whole castle is actually old town of Ibiza.",
          "We just happened to visit when there was a medieval festival on which made the experience all the more wonderful. The views are spectacular and worth the climb up the hill. Don't miss it",
          "There is an interesting history around the castle, there are explanations in English about what happened in that area, there are very beautiful view points that can be seen from there to the beauty of Ibiza. A very nice experience",
          "it's an impressive fortress, and an impressive view from here, but a bit of a challenge to climb it. still it is really worth the effort going around the walls, looking out to the bay and the sea, and admiring the hundreds of years old fortification.",
          "We walked up to the castle from the harbour, this area however is very run down with lots of rubbish and ramshackled houses. But once you turn the corner you are at the side of the entrance to the ramparts and it immediately gets tidyier. The castle area is huge and you can",
          "Very nice historical place with an amazing view love it , blowed me away , if you are in Ibiza old town defo go there",
          "Great views from all angles of castell. During our visit would recommend taking a bottle of water as not pit stops and it was warm when we visited. Steps,slops very slippery even with trainers and birkenstocks",
          "This is a must see in Ibiza, great views of the port from the top, awesome experience and history to see. I highly recommend this site. I toured it on my own and then took a tour of it to get insight into what I had seen.",
          "We spent two days in Ibiza after we were at Las Fallas in Valencia. This was late March. I knew most of the island was not open yet and the town was gonna be basically dead. So I never spent any time figuring out what we were going to do when we got here. Luckily for me, we had",
          "I was amazed that practically every house in the castle seems to be occupied and well maintained - this castle was alive. The atmosphere is truly wonderful and so many people seemed to be locals just walking around enjoying the views",
          "While in Ibiza last september we stumbled upon a castle like structure built into one of the hills there. If you go to Old Ibiza Town you can get to it. The entrance looks is a draw bridge, and once you enter you will see that the castle itself has all these little homes built",
          "Really nice place to see in Ibiza town... Nice view from the castle, would recommend to see this fantastic place",
          "Must see! If you\u2019re being the tourist that you should be...you must check this place out! Great views and lots of history (especially for history buffs like me)! Worth the climb! As an added bonus: rent a scooter! Totally worth it!",
          "Extraordinary views. Cultural experience. This castle offers English descriptions which is very helpful!",
          "We got lost several times and we were moaning about the climb but in the end it really was worth to climb that hill! The views are amazing and the old castle walls make it look very magical!",
          "A great piece of history with excellent guide plaques around the site. Lovely walk through the \"village\" too. great to sit up on the walls and watch the activity in the harbour.",
          "This hike/walk was the highlight of our trip. The place is huge and its amazing that so much of the castle is still standing. We went on Nov 14, 2018 in the late afternoon, so it was a cool walk. We finished at dusk and the castle exterior lights came on and it was so beautiful.",
          "Amazing ancient monument, nicely preserved One can feel so much history while you walk around the castle. You have so many pockets within the castle to explore",
          "Niceittke walk. Need suitable shoes. Nice veiws. Nature reserve with flamingoes in at the bottom to the right .",
          "Well worth the effort to climb up to the top, great views and interesting architecture lots of quirky nooks and crannies to explore",
          "Well looked after monument with great views over the city. Being restored so access to very top is restricted",
          "This is the place to relax in Ibiza town. Nice and cozy shops and restaurants! Great view on the sea and the port. Easy to access by foot.",
          "This walk is a must if you are spending any time in Ibiza Town. The walk is steep so should only be undertaken by people of reasonable fitness. Apart from the height there is uneven ground and cobble stones to cross. However, there are various small shops and a couple of bars",
          "One hell of a climb this, but well worth it allow a good 30 to 40 minutes if you don't stop and remember its not for the faint hearted (the sweat was pouring off me by the time i reached the top)",
          "Don't bother coming here unless you want to tread in dog poo or look at rubbish dumped into the sea. We were unsure if it was rubbish over the sea wall or a commune...seeing as there were mattresses, a fridge, and all sorts of other broken up furniture. Nice.",
          "What a climb but well worth it for the fantastic views. Loved Ibiza Town, stunning! Loads of back streets with some lovely houses. Beautiful yachts in the harbour.amazed that fly tippers even managed to dump over the harbour wall? Statutory Matress,sofa and fridge!",
          "This is such a rustic and traditional place to be. Wandering around the lovely streets popping into the odd shop, stopping for a coffee or a snack. The views are fabulous but be warned it is quite steep in places so if your mobility isn't that good maybe stay further down and",
          "Very impressive views and good to see the maintainence work being carried to preseverve this historic landmark in old ibiza town.All kept very clean and tidy.",
          "I loved this, it was probably my favourite experience on the trip. The kids loved it, views were lovely.",
          "You can walk on the castle wall and in the inner city. The area is very well preserved. It\u2019s is quite big so takes some effort walking the whole thing but it is worth it. There is a nice view on multiple sides.",
          "Splendid views that are well worth the climb. The bastion is impressive from the air but even more memorable when visited. The explanatory notes given around the site are first class.",
          "Good views form Battlements. Some of the footpaths are uneven. Few Bars and restaurants inside the Castle.",
          "We walked, taking our time to take in all the views from different levels. It's a fair walk from bottom to top and back again and wheelchairs and pushchairs can make it so far up but from my memory there were steps to get to the very top - I may be wrong and there might be",
          "The stroll from the main street and harbourside takes you up through the old town and past all shapes, sizes and tastes of shops, restaurants and bars. The higher you climb, the more heritage you soak in, till you reach the seaward battlements of an incredibly well defended",
          "Amazing view on top beautiful old castle On top you can see a typical fruit bar must try Just be careful tu the sun I get sunburned:-(",
          "Lovely start to his walk up through the old drawbridge. Great photo opportunity. Opens to lovely restaurants and then just follow up around the walls. Some wonderful views which keep changing as you walk up and around. It\u2019s steep at times but well worth it.",
          "This is a fantastic example of why Ibiza is not all about clubs and partying. The bars and restaurants within the castle walls and delightful. It\u2019s an amazing place to walk around at take in the sights and sounds. We visited the cathedral and spent a few reflective moments",
          "A steep walk up a steep hill on old cobbled streets to get to the top. But then there are fabulous views all around plus a look in the cathedral so if you're up for the walk it's worth it.",
          "Well worth the walk to the top of the hill or if you are lucky enough you can find a parking space. Not a castle as such but a small village within huge, thick walls.",
          "A visit to Ibiza town on a hot sunny day, we decided to walk up to the castle, make sure to take water with you as the inclines certainly drain you in the heat, but certainly worth it on the climb up. Stunning views all the way. On the way back down some little bars and",
          "The Cathedral and Museums are closed on Sundays. Since these are the main attractions I'd avoid Sundays. Pity, too, that no websites mention this",
          "I visited here with my partner and what can I say it\u2019s beautiful an old Spanish town that was built in the war so it\u2019s very steep and hilly which also gives you lovely views from the top wouldn\u2019t recommend going with children as it is very tiring but was an amazing day out for",
          "A beautiful breathtaking view , a walk up from the town square, bars and restaurants on the way . A wonderful evening .",
          "As said in the subject, the walk up is really lovely. Me and my partner are 21 and we found it a steady walk with shops and bars on your way up. When you reach the top the views are gorgeous. Worth a walk.",
          "First stop we did in Ibiza Town, headed up to the castle. After a steep walk, you can enjoy the gorgeous view.",
          "Castle is quite nice but not spectacular. The area is nice however with some good little cafes local.",
          "We had a great time exploring the castle and enjoyed visiting the little cafe and restaurants along the route up. Was a long way up but the view from the top well worth it!",
          "Visited a week ago when visiting Ibiza Town really glad we made the effort it was a very hot day 35c + the views were amazing and places to stop on the way for drinks also a art gallery , able to do old and new Ibiza in one day \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A must visit place in Ibiza... Not only is it a cool place to walk around, theres also bars and shops to explore... The views are fantastic.",
          "Beautiful place if you are in Ibiza is a must to get there. The food is amazing,the streets are unforgettable.",
          "I can\u2019t say enough about this place ... just great. From when you land in the marina to walking around the town to the wonderful old town and cocktail bars, restaurants in the old town .. a must visit!",
          "Walked to the very top - cathedral was lovely but route very (very) steep. Lots of lovely surprises along the way, shops, quite corners, great views, little cafes (but do bring some water of your own along). Its not why you came to Ibiza but once there it has to be done!!!",
          "Ibiza is much more than beaches, sea, nightlife and discos, Should be a \u201cmust\u201d visit when you come to Ibiza. Take your time to walk around \u201cDalt Vila\u201d, get lost in the narrow streets, small shops and restaurants. Don\u2019t miss the castle on the top of the hill.",
          "Very nice view to the city and sea. It\u2019s very hot because of the stone construction. It\u2019s recommended to use a cap and enough sun protection. You can walk or just enjoy drinks and snacks.",
          "it is steep and it can be long ( thank god for the plentiful little cafes and bars dotted along the route). once you reach the top the views are spectacular and well worth the effort and the castle and church are a step back in time .",
          "A little bit long to get there, but with a very beautiful landscape of the bay and the town. Good places for photo shooting.",
          "Great place to visit if your nearby and looking to move away from your sunbed for a day. Quite a lot of walking required if you wish to go to the top, lots to see in the local area. Some lovely little independent shops as well as the nearby modern quarter and marina too!",
          "Visited Ibiza port and old town in the day and the evening, its an amazing place and definitely well worth the visit. Lovely old streets and nice cafes to relax and have a coffee and watch the world go by, the castle is very beautiful to visit but expect a long walk and this",
          "A group of 4 of us arrived early evening. The sun was blazing, glad we had sunblock and I had a hat as there\u2019s no shelter there. The view is 360 and you look miles out to see, all of the harbour and both new and the lovely old town. The rooftops were both quants and lovely.",
          "Great visit to the castle walked around the wall then in side cathedral... Worth getting a map of castle at the tourist information by harbour it has lots of information about castle cathedral and walking routes",
          "We enjoyed a leisurely, though at times a bit steep, walk up to see the old fortress. Saw few areas where you can see sections of ancient stone walls. At the top, wonderful views of the sea, harbor and town! The drawbridge is \"recent.\"",
          "If you're going to be in Ibiza, and you are in pretty good shape, you should put this castle on your list of things to do during the day. A couple of things to worry about: (1) when it gets hot, it gets really hot here. So take that into consideration. (2) the treck is not for",
          "I must be a mad dog as we we did this during the midday sun! Arrving at the foot of this climb and not really knowing where to start the journey upward we started the journey at the foot of Carrer de Narcis Puget and began the climb. In hindsight this was good and bad. I think",
          "This is a great place to visit to see a little Ibiza history. The views are amazing. There were also some local artists selling their goods, which were great. Worth the hike!",
          "Definitely recommend. It\u2019s a very big steep walk but worth it!! Make sure you go all the way to the top!",
          "Well worth a visit to the historical part of a lovely city. Bit of a climb, steps and slopes. Hidden shops and bars at the lower ends. Great views over harbour and bay. Free entry all you pay is sweat\ud83c\udfd6\u2600\ufe0f",
          "We had a lovely day in Ibiza town we got the bus from Es canna fabulous views from the top of castle quiet steep going up but well worth it nice cafe halfway up we came back by the ferry nice harbour and boats",
          "Walking the small streets to reach the top to observe the surroundings of the city. Many souvenir shops and small restaurants all the way up. Magnificent trip",
          "We spend the day in Ibiza and walked up the steep hills to the Castle at the top, its well worth it with lots to see on the way up and once there the views and the Castle are amazing. Its good to walk around the city walls with a very pretty and quaint village inside, don't",
          "Ibiza town is a lovely place , the harbour is very active with luxurious yachts and boats coming in and out , we were lucky to see the Maltese Falcon dock , the walk up to the castle is worth it , for the lovely views , take plenty of water .",
          "Having used the local bus to get to Ibiza Town we decided it was a no brainer to get to the top of the town. In fairness it was VERY hard work...but then we are older and not used to walking up, and up in the heat. But the views over the rooftops to the town, to the sea and",
          "The walk up to the castle is full of great architecture and small bars around the corners. You will see an amazing panoramic view once on top",
          "A bit of a climb but views amazing. Cobble stone road so need to be careful, a bit slippery especially on way down. You see lots of wonderful buildings. There is a little cafe bar to the left of the steep entrance, very good food and very reasonable.",
          "What a beautiful and historic place. The fact people still live there in the cobbled streets is amazing, the Cathedral at the top is also beautiful and the views from the walled areas across Ibiza Town and Harbour are fantastic. Well worth the slog up the narrow paths to get to",
          "Visited the old town of ibiza on 19th june. It's amazing. The views are spectacular. It's a must if you are going to ibiza. We caught the bus from Santa Eulila. They run every 20 minutes. It only cost 2\u20ac each way. So for 8\u20ac me and my husband went there and back. We walked right",
          "castle dominates ibiza town. well worth the climb up to get great views & photo opportunities. not really suitable for those with mobility issues or for pushing baby buggies. A few cafes within walls for refreshments.",
          "a must when visiting the town. stunning views. walking up the hill is not easy with the old cobbles, coming down through the old streets is a simular challenge. The is a supprise view around every twist of the journey. Don't forget to call in at the cathedral. No cost for this",
          "Spectacular sight dominating Ibiza town. Can be hard going in the blazing heat to reach the top but worth the effort!",
          "Excellent place to go and visit, while u r in the island. Greatest view. After u finished on ur way down, you will find little restaurants and small shops, worth visiting, it might surprise you!!!! Very colorful and interesting",
          "The Castle of Ibiza is surely worth visiting. You can imagine the stronghold, when walking around the castle. The view is also very good. The entire Ibiza town can be seen from there. There are also good restaurants and shops.",
          "Such a great time here, me and my partner spent half the day visiting the Castle and the grounds around it. The long, steep walk to the top was well worth it as you got to see stunning views of Ibiza town for miles on end. Beautiful surrounding at the top, whilst the small",

          "Long slow climb up 100s of steps but well worth it for the fabulous views. Quient little shops selling quality clothing, many cafes and tapas bars to enjoy a meal and a drink.",
          "I have been to this castle around seven times now, every time the experience becomes more intense.....if you take a look here over the Old Town after dark you can see where all the cool rooftop bars are! Great tip!",
          "We had a fantastic few hours up at the castle, our son loved it and especially reading all the information plaques, each corner we turned there were more amazing views and quirky things to read about and find! A word of warning, we went on a very hot day, also during siesta",
          "Steep with small children but worth getting to the top where there are grisly stories about dropping rocks onto would-be invader\u2019s heads! Great views, awesome stonework and well signposted features in three languages.",
          "Visited on a day out. Only meant a quick visit but it is so big. Went in through the bottom entrance to the left and up through the square. From here you overlook the harbour. Continued up through a series of steps and passage ways to the top. There is now a museum at the top",
          "I drove from near San Antonio following signs for Eivissa, all very straightforward. Once you come into Eivissa you see the castle in the far distance and head towards it. I lost the signs for the Castle at some point but kept heading uphill and found myself near, parked up in",
          "A walk up and around the castle is great use of a cloudy day. It\u2019s steep in places and is exceptionally slippery in the wet. Lots of little shops and cafes tucked away and lots to see. Info plaques on the history.",
          "We visited Ibiza town (locally named Eivissa town) for the day on our recent stay in SAN Antonio which is a half hour local bus ride and costs only 2 euros each way from the bus station, the castle has a great view over the town but is built on a hill and may not be suitable for",
          "It is worth the walk up the winding roads, Steep climb in places but the view is worth it. We had our toddler in a pushchair with us, he slept all the way up the top which did surprise us as is just cobbles all the way. It is pushchair friendly though. Go in the am or early",
          "Beautiful walk and scenic view! Be prepared to walk up and down the steps but it's definitely worth it :)",

          "Definitely worth the walk! Beautiful scenes, lovely little shops, Spanish restaurants & bars near by.",
          "This is such a beautiful place to visit with quaint streets and shops with restaurants. The walk to the top is most definitely worth it and once you get there the views are outstanding. Although there are a lot of steps so it\u2019s not for the faint hearted. If you are visiting",

          "Visited the castle overlooking the old town of Ibiza last week (13/5/2018) and was wonderfully surprised ( and lucky! ) to find that there was a fantastic medieval fayre taking place that week. It is one of the largest fayres I've been to and the atmosphere was incredible. Many",
          "It's a pretty steep climb but it's worth the effort because you'll be rewarded with great views of the old town below. Along the way there are strategically placed plaques in multiple languages explaining the historical points of interest. The area is well preserved and even",
          "Ok, many steps need to be taken but they are all worth it. The was up goes thru the old town and arriving at the Castle offers many different views over the town.",
          "To shave off that dessert/bevvy then head up the steps or slope right to the top for the best view in Ibiza. There is a church at the top to have a sit down and get your breath back. There are some free parking spaces dotted around if you know where you\u2019re going.",
          "It\u2019s always a BIG pleasure to stroll around in Ibiza (old) town between history, antic castle and nice restaurants, shops, bars.... We enjoyed our time in the afternoon as well as in the evening. Loads to see and (maybe) to shop. Many nice places to eat and good bars to have",

          "An awesome UNESCO World Heritage site that offers some of the best views of Ibiza. Ocean on 3 sides and the city on one side looks beautiful. Built in 7th Century, it has an interesting history worth learning. A very photogenic location and is a must visit in Ibiza. There is",
          "Best place to go to view the whole of Ibiza town and port. They have car parks at the top so if your not a walker don\u2019t worry. Best thing to do in Ibiza",
          "Great place to visit with fantastic views and places to have drink and eat. Pick a nice sunny calm day and take it easy on the climb up. It\u2019s worth the climb and Church is fantastic too.",
          "Stunning views from the top after a steep climb, but well worth it. Interpretation panels are mostly in Spanish, but this does not spoil the enjoyment of the scenery from the top or enjoying the detail of the medieval town on the way up.",
          "We arrived by bus from Santa Eulalia and had low expectations but actually really enjoyed the Old Town views and walk up to the fortified castle and cathedral. Would highly recommend. Mainly cobbled and some steep inclines and steps, but well maintained and easy to walk.",
          "We had a quick visit after taking a wrong turn. You can park at the bottom and walk up but we ended up driving to to the top and parking up. The ground is quite roof so check your footwear. I did just about manage in flip-flops but ideally should of had my trainers on.",
          "Quite a walk up a steep slippery path but well worth the view at the top! Would recommend going on a sunny day to make full use of the views!",
          "Well worth a trip up to take in the view. Free access. Wear decent shoes as the road up to the top can be very uneven consisting of cobbles and stones. Not suitable for people of limited walking ability or those in wheelchairs, very steep in parts. The cobbles are worn and",
          "Strolled up from the old town, through the winding streets and we were rewarded with brilliant views overlooking the port and then out to sea, its well worth the hike to the top, for the stunning photo's taken. We visited early April and unfortunately, there was not a lot open",
          "Excellent way to gently explore the historical castle and take in the views of the surrounding Barbour and city lots of nice places to eat . Just be careful about inflated prices at the Barbour side restaurants best to go in just 20 meters or so from the front and prices are",

          "This is a fairly nice walk uphill and definitely confusing if you're not using Google Maps. I lost my way about 5 times while exploring the surrounding areas of the castle. The castle itselg is free to enter but there's nothing much to it. Take your water bottle,",

          "Well worth the steep walk and you will be rewarded with fantastic views of Ibiza town and harbour. The shops up here are a little cheaper than those in town. A choice of cafes and bars , a visit to the church is a must.",
          "I am interested in Spanish history, the Inquisition and medieval castles so this was an excellent excursion on my last day in Ibiza, 17 October 2017, after having a long swim on the beautiful beach to the south west of Eivissa town. There is a small museum on the top of the",

          "We went to visit the old town on a hot sunny day and that is not the best time to go . The streets are all cobbled stone and can be slippery.as well as very hilly . It is not a castle at all, but a fortified walled city, overlooking the harbour to the east, the sea to the south",
          "Well ended upon Ibiza town on an unexpected bus ride Spoke with some one on the bus who said the Castle was a must We came here about 43 years ago Could not remember it, after a deep breath we made it to the top, no charge to get in, views where magnificent The slow wander down",

          "We travelled in from Santa Eulalia to visit the castle and it was well worth the effort. Great views out across harbour and beyond to the sea. In days of old it must have been an awesome fortification and to some extent it still is today. Wandering around the ramparts and narrow",

          "Every time I come to Ibiza. I visit this place, it is truly beautiful and worth the walk. The view you get from the top is stunning. I've learnt over the years it's best to get there earlier in the morning. I usually get there for around 9am. That way I can have a steady walk",
          "Definitely worth going to Ibiza town to visit the castle! Tip: if you're travelling to Ibiza town from playa den bossa you can get the boat back to bossa from the marina for \u20ac4 and it takes 20 mins",
          "the views make it worth it and as its surrounded by the old town the walk up is enjotable aswell, only thing is its busy very busy, and you can see its all being maintained and being made tourist friendly so a lot of modern stuff chreaping in amoung the tradition but the views",
          "Visited Ibiza at the end of April. Specifically that we wanted less tourists and not too warm.It was simply beautiful.Can be a bit steep in places as it's some trek too the top but it's a must.Its the first time in years that there's no scaffolding and work has finally finished.x",

          "Excellent sight seeing experience. Shouldn't be missed if you are in Ibiza Town, however, if you want to see all of the castle on the way up you need to walk and it is quite steep in areas with lots of steps thrown in for good measure, but definitely worth it. There are lots",
          "The castle is an amazing place to visit ... every time i visit Ibiza I have to go here there is a beautiful Cathedral at the top of the castle and a hidden museum with lots of church treasures inside the Cathedral, other museums too worth a look for Roman treasures (check",
          "Tough, challenging walk, so please be prepared. If you have any difficulties with steep aggressive walks, do not try. It's worth it if you can. Great exercise and a great day activity away from the craziness. Very beautiful and amazing photos!",
          "Although the old town still looks beautiful Ibiza changed into a very commercial place. Now it has been more than 30 years and in my memory it was such a relaxt place with lots of relaxt people who would dress up in so many different outfits, but now youngster walk with their",
          "I found it a rather challenging walk. Not the walk itself if you are reasonably fit - i just had a hard time finding the way and knowing where to go. So going up I must have used about twice the time needed if you know the way. Anyhow, the view from the top is really worth the",
          "Simply stunning views over the Ibiza coast, if you have the stamina to climb the many steps required to get the top. Do not attempt this on a hot day, wear flat shoes with grip (trainers) as with old buildings the path is made from large pebbles which could be slippery if wet. A",
          "We found that it was a really hard trek to the top especially in the afternoon Sun but once you get to the top and you see the views it's really was worth the effort,you can see why the Romans built this castle on the top of the hill you can see for miles then when you come",
          "Amazing panoramic views this place is steeped in history and the views are breathtaking from all angles yes it is quite hardening getting up there when temp 30plus but well worth it paths are a bit on slippy side need grippy shoes not flip flops you won't be disappointed",
          "After traveling from Es Canna on the ferry the views of Ibiza are amazing.walked to the top of the castle It is a hard climb for 70 and 80 yr olds but to look from the top is worth it. Plenty of places to stop on the way to the top.",
          "Two thing are breath taking. One the long steep climb to the top will take your breath away not for less able.Be sure to pack plenty of water.There are some interesting points on the way to stop and admire. The second is the views from the top these are truly Breath taking and",

          "Our family were staying in a apartment in Ibiza town for a night and we wanted to climb the steep path to the castle and just as we expected it was very steep. Once we reached the top you could see a spectacular view of the whole town you could clearly see the port and boats",

          "Like so many songs said, expect the unexpected: the old town of Ibiza is historically of great interest and offers great walks along the walls and inside the walls! The old town is lovely and offers you something that you don't normally associate with the island of Ibiza...",
          "Family with ages from 6-72 attempted this climb on a really hot day - it was a struggle for some but if you can get everyone to the main viewing area ; the views are well worth it . There are some shaded areas for respite but it's not one for those who are not steady on their",
          "It's a bit of a trek up some steep, slippy cobbles but it's worth it when there. The views are simply amazing. Definitely a must if in Ibiza.",
          "Since Ibiza is a night island places open late, so going to the castle in the morning gives you the experience of walking the medieval streets all the way to the top without modern distractions. Once on top, you get the best view on th island. On th way there you'll also find",
          "When you walking in close alleys you come back to 200years ago;you can find every thing you want but it was expensive;you can enjoy the sound of the music that the people play it;if you were lucky you can find the bar that they put big couch similar to pillows on the",

          "Thursday night in Ibiza town. Arrived at 8pm, the place was reasonably busy at Sunset. We walked through the old town and up to the top of the hill to reach the castle. What a magical place. Take your time and enjoy the magical atmosphere. The walk is fairly steep but worth it",
          "It took us ages to get to the top as it was during heat wave and far too hot really to be climbing up there. Had to make alot of stops to catch our breath and cool down. I had to go the last 300yds up alone in the end as too much for my old man, he was worn out and frightened it",
          "A very superb place and around the castle is all this splendour of ships and beautiful restaurants! A top place for looking at the sites around and shopping too!",
          "From the castle of Ibiza you can get a good look of the city of Ibiza. The old town is connected to the castle and there are restaurants, bars and small boutiques. The climb up to the castle's walls was really sweaty, even though it was around 19 in the evening. Well, that's",
          "We hiked the entire castle walls and it was a bit vertical in some spots...but worth the energy investments. The views will knock your socks off. Everything is clean and well maintained. However, there are no public bathrooms. So if ya gotta go, grand a drink somewhere first",
          "It takes you back to ancient history to the Phoenicians who build this castle, allot to see and read . in adition old Churches and piazzas with wonderfull site seeing overlooking the port . while roaming arround the place you will discover hundreds of small cafe and restaurants",
          "It is a steep climb up to the castle of Ibiza but the views of Ibiza town and the bay are well worth it. We had a pushchair with us and it's not very pushchair friendly, there are a lot of steps. We went on a Monday and the Cathedral was closed which was disappointing. Walking",
          "The castle is a bit of a mission to get to, up lots of steep narrow streets but definitely worth a visit - you won't get a better view across Ibiza town from anywhere else \ud83d\ude0a!",

          "Very well maintained castle on the high ground gives you awesome views of this party town with its large yachts in the harbor below. Royal princes, movie royalty, and wealthy icons of sports dock their large yachts well within the view from these high walls on the cliff. The",
          "The trip worth because of the view. It's really a nice view from the top of the hill. Otherwise is a really bad refurbished area without any good taste, full of bad concrete walls and trip hazards. It was expected more from a old city centre.",
          "This was probably one of the most amazing places I've seen and worth the walk up hill in the heat! We were told to go see this in the evening, as it gets very hot, but we decided to go during the day! We spent 5 hours in town, not all at the castle but I good bit of time",

          "A must do on a visit to Ibiza town if you can manage it. We did it in 36 degree heat! Its a vary taxing, steep walk with lots of steps but the views are stunning. The cobbles are lethally slippy though so take care, especially coming down when your legs feel a bit wobbly after",
          "It's a very steep walk to the top and would be very difficult for anyone with any mobility problems but once you've made it up the views are absolutely breathtaking , coming back down isn't much easier lol worth a visit if your feeling athletic :)",

          "Was a long hike, very steep hill. If you take a \"tour\", I believe that they bus you up. The wind made the trip nice. Could be tough on a hot day without wind.",
          "But they could do so much more with it. Its the type of place the National Trust would have a field day with. Nice to visit but I did think where's the castle. It's more walls and views than anything",
          "We love Ibiza city, wonderful historical place full of energy. Many small cosy restaurants and boutiques. But also easy to find quiet places. Only disappointment: Taxis are notoriously difficult to get on time.",

          "As the title says, prepare yourself to a steep upward slope and around 2 hours of walk without any sign about the route you should follow. Everybody is going without any indication since there is no sketch or sign showing where you are or where you should head from that point",
          "It is more like just walls and streets rising high but the views are perfect. Cobbled streets, better wear a comfortable footwear. No toilets around all mountain. you can discover perfect corners and panoramas for pictures. Feels like you are at the top of the world.",

          "We were lucky to visit on the first day of the medieval market for this year. It was wonderful. The walk up to the castle was good for the calf muscles and worth it for the view of the town. We then spent a few fabulous hours walking around the small streets which were all full",

          "The castle is located at the highest point of a hill in Ibiza and overlooks the port of Ibiza. So it is well suited as a defensive outpost. It includes several defensive bastions, towers, battle stations and tunnels and is surrounded by a defensive wall. The castle dates back",

        "wiki": "Ibiza (Spanish: [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]; Catalan: Eivissa [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]; see below) is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\nIbiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe official Catalan name is Eivissa (locally [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]). Its name in Spanish is Ibiza (pronounced [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]). In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish ( eye-BEE-th\u0259, ih-), whereas in American English the pronunciation is closer to Latin American Spanish ( ib-EE-z\u0259,  ee-BEE-s\u0259, and so forth).\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (Phoenician: \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0c, \u02beB\u0160M, \"Dedicated to Bes\"). It was later known to Romans as Ebusus. The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityo\u00fbssai (\u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"Pine-Covered Islands\").In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum), and wool.\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Moors in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of D\u00e9nia\u2014the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community\u2014and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia during some time (11th century).\nIbiza together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon, and Alc\u00e1cer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.The island was conquered by Aragonese King James I in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities.\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. At \"God's Finger\" in the Benirr\u00e0s Bay there are some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost six times smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the \"Pitiusas\" or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\n\n== Administration ==\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Majorca.  Ibiza comprises five of the community's 67 municipalities. Clockwise from the south coast, these are:\n\nSant Josep de sa Talaia (Spanish: San Jos\u00e9)\nSant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio Abad)\nSant Joan de Labritja (San Juan Bautista)\nSanta Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo)\nVila d'Eivissa (\"Ibiza Town\"; known simply as Vila, \"Town\")At the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated 147,914 by the start of 2019, and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nIbiza has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering on a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), while the average low is 14.3 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and very dry, with few rainy days, often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.7 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F), while the average low is 8.1 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.3 \u00b0C (87 \u00b0F), while the low is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 \u00b0C (67 \u00b0F) and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe typical folkloric dance of Ibiza is Ball Pag\u00e8s. The origin of these dances is unknown. Nowadays, this tradition is in the process of recovery, thanks to the efforts of different Colles of Ball Pages of the islands.\nThe clothing of the dancers is very colorful. The speed of the dance can be slow, medium or fast, although Sa Llarga, is the most danced way, and it's fast, dynamic and energetic, where the male dancer jumps around the woman and lifts up his legs.\n\n\n== People ==\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2019 had reached 147,914. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears \u2013 IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch, in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the expatriate population (Rozenberg 1990).\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francol\u00ed was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: English punk musician John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious), the psychedelic rock band Philiac, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving, and film director/actor Orson Welles.\n\n\n== Language ==\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, like English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore and Sant Antoni to the West.\nNight life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Privilege (formerly Ku), Amnesia and Es Parad\u00eds. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music.  The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy, and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\nThe season traditionally begins at the end of May, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza\u2019s clubs over the course of a three week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three day conference which has taken place on the island every year since 2008.\nClosing Parties signal the end of the clubbing season, taking place at the end of September and into the first two weeks of October. Nearly all of Ibiza's clubs remain shut during the winter until reopening the following summer.\nA typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and \"disco sunrises\". Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehavior from young adult tourists, it has acquired the sobriquet \"Gomorrah of the Med\". Also well known is Caf\u00e9 del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by Jos\u00e9 Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers, such as Patrick Topping, Carl Cox, Green Velvet, Jozeff and many more international artists.\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIbiza has been featured in the racing game Test Drive Unlimited 2, in which the player can drive around the entire island. The game also features the island of Oahu (Hawaii's third-largest island).\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley, Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel, A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank, They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene, and The Python Project by Victor Canning. Memes Eivissencs also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone. in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast.\"Because of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots.  A monument (\"The Egg\") erected in honour of Christopher Columbus can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Llu\u00eds Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andr\u00e8s has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).  In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\" which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.Ibiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect in 1 July 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi) not much more tourism can be supported.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Majorca, D\u00e9nia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eul\u00e0ria, and Figueretes\u2013Platja d'en Bossa.Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town\u2014every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eul\u00e0ria.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nIbiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as flaons. Other savory dishes include sofrit pag\u00e8s, bullit de peix (fish stew), arr\u00f2s de matan\u00e7a (rice with pork) and arr\u00f2s a la marinera.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHead, Barclay;  et al.

It is divided into two main parts: the old town, called the Dalt Vila (literally \"Upper Town\"), located on a little mountain by the sea, and the modern part, called the Eixample (\"extension\").\nThe city, which has a population of 49,727 (2018), is the capital and most populous settlement of the island and of the Pine Islands group, which includes Ibiza and Formentera.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nIbiza is widely known and visited for its exciting nightlife. Some of the island's most notable nightclubs include Pacha, Amnesia, Space, and Ushua\u00efa. These four nightclubs are regularly in the top three of DJ Magazine's annual top 100 global clubs' chart.\n\n\n=== Sightseeing ===\nSights include  the cathedral of Santa Maria d'Eivissa (14th century), located at the top of the Dalt Vila, and  the Punic necropolis of Puig des Molins. Nearby is also the monument of Christ, the Sacred Heart of Jesus,  a 23-metre-high (75 ft) statue inspired by Christ the Redeemer, which is 3.1 miles (5.0 km) north of the city.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of municipalities in the Balearic Islands\nSes Feixes Wetlands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ibiza Town at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website \nTourism Excellence Plan\nConsell d'Evissa (in Catalan and Spanish) Local government\nEivissa Archaeological Museum (in Catalan and Spanish)\nReal time marine traffic at Ibiza Port\nPanoramic virtual tour of Ibiza Town port",

          "This gem sits behind the church on the hill. A new build museum showing the artifacts from the past over few thousand years.the displays are broken up into different periods of time including short video in each section and a story card telling you about that period. Even before",
          "Ancient necropolis that has been (is being) excavated. The excellent museum tells the story of burials on the island very informatively. You are given a hard hat to look round the area outside. Seemed a bit of overkill at first, but when you go down into the excavated chamber,",
          "We absolutely loved this museum. A short walk from the entrance to Dalt Vila (and well signposted) I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn more about the history of the area. For two adults the entrance was under 5 euro total which is fantastic value as we spent",
          "while the field of the necropolis may be of limited interest for non-professionals, the museum linked to it (see also here on Tripadvisor under Museu Puig Molin) is a highlight and an absolute must when in Ibiza.",
          "This museum is really interesting and has the remains of the ancient necropolis. There is a staircase down into some areas underground and the actual museum has lots of really interesting artifacts.",
          "Fab! Free on a Sunday. Enough people coming and going but a little quieter on Sunday which is nice. Spend an hour and a half here I say! In Ibiza Town so it is within walking distance from castles, port/yacht harbour, the other featured museum and restaurants. Three rooms of",
          "It's as good as everyone says with hundreds of artefacts inside and the tombs themselves outside. Nice museum replicas in the shop too. We tried to visit a couple of years ago but found it closed, and when it's closed it somehow looks like it\u2019s been closed for good. So, thanks",
          "Visited in May 2018 this museum charges under \u20ac3 entry per adult and provides exceptional value for money. The museum is filled with great artifacts and historical and educational videos suitable for all. The museum staff are friendly and helpful and available to offer more",
          "We were incredibly surprised how interesting and well done it was in most every way. Three major cultures all buried their dead in the same and only place in Ibiza. Each with a different method, ceremony, and afterlife belief and it\u2019s all there to enjoy",

          "When my mum told me about this site, I just had to visit. My mums previous visit was many years ago when she lived in Ibiza and it was just caves and graves. The whole museum revolves around death, beliefs and funeral rituals of various cultures. The museum part is quite small",
          "As someone who always is interested in the history of mankind, this is paradise. Fantastic museum, and of course the tombs outside are beyond interesting. Just wow, and I can only hope everyone visiting Ibiza takes a break from the beaches to visit this place.",
          "The museum is beautifully laid out and very interesting. I particularly enjoyed seeing the actual tombs. By pure chance we visited around noon on the last Sunday of the month and experienced a re-enactment and were offered free refreshments which was just lovely so if possible",
          "Worth a visit if you're in the area. Modern, well designed museum with lots of audio visual displays. Rooms displaying archeological finds from the site of the necropolis. Best bit is visiting the actual tombs outside in the grounds.",

          "Just west of the fortress is a small but very well done museum devoted to burial rites as practiced historically on Ibiza. I mean when you have over 3000 crypts dug out of the stone that is Ibiza you might as well turn it into a historical/tourist attraction. Very well done",
          "Interesting museum to walk around to give you a background to the history of the island. The only downside are the strange opening hours.",
          "This museum has been done very well. Ultra modern with a lot of thought put into the layout and presentation of the well-preserved artefacts found. There is a great deal of history to be seen! My only criticism is that whilst the video comes with an English version, there is no",

          "A little worrisome arriving at CBbC and seeing the throngs of people on this beautiful beach. The white sand and crystal clear blue water is what makes CBbC special. Appearances can be deceiving and that is what CBbC is. So take away the beautiful beach and sand and you might as",
          "It\u2019s a little isolated with little to do here but well worth a visit. I love this part of the island however can be a pain when you want to go and you\u2019re sat waiting for the ferry.",
          "We visited this beach yesterday and were hugely disappointed. Service was extremely poor and none of the staff appeared to want to help us. The CBBC appears to have taken over this charming beach. We were looking for 2 beds at 1000 (we didn\u2019t reserve) and the only option was",
          "A great spot for gorgeous blue waters and picturesque scenery, The beach is a little on the smaller side and can get quite packed during the peak season. The promoters and people trying to flog stuff did annoy me though! And my GOD did it take a long time to get served at the",
          "We visited here today with our young son's aged 1 and 2. Lots of positives. Easy to get too. Loads of parking, costs \u20ac5 but that's fine. You get a bottle of water at the bar included in that. There are lovely restaurants, sun loungers and drinks available here but it is pricey.",
          "Stunning views, easy swim great restaurants. Parking was \u20ac5 euro and this got you a free drink at the bar too.",
          "If I have to be honest, that is one of my favourite beaches in Ibiza. Cala Bassa cristal blue waters and soft sand, makes me live the paradise moment, enjoy swimming, snorkeling and boat trips around it is one of my top experiences in the white island.",
          "Strongly suggested for a relaxing day on the beach. Kids can enjoy the sand and adults can enjoy water sports and nice bars/restaurants.",
          "Caught the water taxi (\u20ac9 return pp) from San Antonio (outside Hawaii hotel) gorgeous beach but gets very very busy. Be sure to bring a parasol and lots of refreshments! The Cala Bassa beach club has the monopoly on this place and if you can afford a day bed all day a coif",
          "Espectacular views, great beach. Enough parking, great to take a long walk. Excellent restaurant with beautiful views and delicious food.",
          "What a beautiful beach, packed and parking is 5 euro (which includes a drink) but beautiful views and we loved it",
          "We used to love this quiet beach with lovely pine trees it's still nice but we had best time years ago it was paradise, sea still wonderful we really enjoyed our visit.",
          "We spent the day there and had lunch! It was expensive but was incredible! Sea was lovely and clear but a lot of jelly fish causing problems! Defiantly will return.",
          "Back in the day ,well only about 5 years ago Casa Bassa was an oasis of calm & beauty. We use to enjoy sitting under the cool pine trees above the beach relaxing & people watching the beach below.Enjoyng lunch with a choice of three or four small reasonable priced restaurants.",
          "What an amazing beach with fantastic music, love it!!! The water, the view, the music, just awsome. Also if you park there you get a free drink.",
          "The beach is clear, sandy with shallow waters. There is a big parking that you pay 5 euros. Another way to get there easy is by bus.",
          "Awful experience!! Ruined my day. Service is an absolute mess! Stuff is not attentive to client\u2019s wishes. While making a reservation of the sun beds, I named a few things that were very important for me. I got a confirmation. but the when arrived the next day - appeared that",
          "This place is my best friend's fav place in the entire world so I had to go and visit as soon as I knew I was coming to Ibiza. It did not disappoint. The most stunningly beautiful bay with crystal waters and such a chilled out vibe. Loved it.",
          "Pretty busy beach but nice to swim in and enjoy an afternoon of suntanning, some food options nearby too.",
          "The beach is lovely and didn't get too full, in the evening there are people selling products but this is Ibiza, they leave you alone if you say no.",
          "We went here to escape the more crowded beaches at St. Antony. It was about a 20 cab ride away which we booked through our hotel. we spent the entire afternoon on the beach. for an ibiza beach I would think its middle of the road. We found a spot on the beach pretty quickly",
          "Lovely beach with crystal clear water. Can pay for sun beds or sit on the sand. Good waiter service if in the beds and can either lunch there or in the restaurant above. Lots of nice shops and a place to have massages. The loo\u2019s are kept really keen. Car parking could be a pain",
          "As this beach is calm & shallow it\u2019s excellent beach. Plenty parking makes it easy to visit and therefore it\u2019s mean I gets full. Beach club caterer for most budgets also",
          "It is nice to visit and I would recommend going for a look, however, the beach gets ridiculously over crowded! By around 12 pm there was no room at all, not even standing room. Then you have people constantly trying to sell you towels, bracelets, bikinis etc. and they are very",
          "We stopped off for an hour on this beach, the beach was beautiful, sea very clear with fish Swimming around the feet, there are plenty of places to eat and drink Highly recommended to anyone to visit",
          "Cala Bassa has a very nice beach and they know it. Parking near the beach costed us 5 euros. There is also free parking but its a small walk and no places quaranteed. Having a lunch or diner in CBbc is expensive but worth it (for me and my family). Lots of nice tables in the",
          "We took a bus from outside the hotel we stayed at Naeco 4 star to Cala Bassa. It was absolutely amazing, such clear water and a very chilled out relaxing area perfect for lots of photos. Cafes and places to get drinks/beverages and shops for clothing/souvenirs. Would go again.",
          "Such a lovely day getting the boat across to this stunning beach club, the beds were over priced but beautiful !! Shame there were so many jelly fish in the sea though Put us off going in",
          "The beach was beautiful and not too crowded. The beach side restaurant also had great drinks, a little weak but definitely delicious.",
          "Awesome beach and great family feel. \u20ac5 to park and you have the luxury of the beaches. Only reason for the 4 star and not 5 is the beach sellers. Must have been 20 of them selling there items, when you said no they were not for leaving",
          "The beach is stunning and the sea shallow to bathe.You don't have to go far out to see fish. However, the beach is divided into section run by The Cala Bassa Beach Club and unless you pay a lot of dollar, you ain't getting a sun lounger. Sit on you towel effort. The beach",
          "I took a day trip here in early June this year he has a spectacular blue green colour water very soft sand clean water and beach. Water is relatively shallow but may get deeper though a few Rocky areas to avoid because they can be Sharp underfoot. We saw lots of fish swimming",
          "Daughter's wedding held here, had nearly 60 guests, brilliant service, friendly staff, great food and very clean, everyone had a brilliant day. Made her day magical. Thank you.",
          "Got the L7 bus from San Antonio to Cala Bassa, 3\u20ac. Very easy to get to. The only down side was the sheer amount of the sales guys on this beach, it was another level. Other than that, definitely worth a visit. There is the CBbC snack place at the far end of the beach to get",
          "Visited Cala Bassa 7 years after my first visit. Unfortunately, the beautiful place has fallen victim to pure Ibizan greed. The Cala Bassa Beach Club has all but destroyed the place for a quick buck. Sun beds are piled on top of each other and sold at double extortionate prices.",
          "The views over Cala Bassa are spectacular! The restaurant is so pretty, spread out over the beach, hidden between stunning trees, its so magical. The staff are great, the food is amazing. I have ordered the same meal the last 3 times, the chicken wok! It is the best dish I have",
          "My partner and I came here on the first day of our trip following on from a visit to here last year. The surroundings are stunning and the food is on point. I would highly recommend coming here if you are near San Antonio and want to escape to somewhere more tranquil.",
          "Took a water taxi to Cala Bassa beach 9 euros from San Antonio. I remember this beach from years ago it was gorgeous back then and still is. The water is mint green it\u2019s so clear & beautiful. There are a number of beach sellers who will sell you an umbrella & a large towel to",
          "Like my title says, this has got to be the best beach in Ibiza... with water sports, clear blue waters, white sands and baby cliffs to jump of....and not too many people either... hire a car and go to this place ....#awesome",
          "Visited in May 18. The food was excellent, not an enormous variety but enough to satisfy 4 people with different tastes. The main meals were very good but the pudding (cheesecake) was the best thing I tasted all holiday.",
          "Had lunch with friends, the views were great and everyone very friendly. The food was very touristy and poor quality. Overpriced for what was served. Would go for the beach but not the restaurant.",
          "This was a gorgeous little beach that we visited in July last year. It was very clean and the water was so clear. I just wish I had known in advance to book a lounger with the beach club. They were full all day so we ended up on towels on the beach. It was fine but the",
          "You can't visit Ibiza without seen this place. Nice atmosphere, lovely food and is just by the see. We love it \ud83e\udd17",
          "Travelled by bus from san antonio, so easy to get there. Beautifull setting for sunbathing and swimming, very safe. Please go and enjoy a great day.",
          "Even in april, this beach was busy. Nice beach with excellent beach bar. Parking 5 euro. There are some caves as well where you can swim in cristal clear water",
          "Clear water , beach club , jet ski , paradise... love this beach more than Cala Conta ... love to go there by the boat from San Antoni",
          "Best to use beaches in Ibiza from May onwards, weather is hit or a miss before this. Water very clear good for snorkelling, plenty of fish to see.",
          "We went to have a look, knowing it would be quiet, it really is a summer resort. However it is cute and I would imagine very lively in the season. The sea was a wonderful turquoise colour and the beach deserted, lovely!",
          "Cala Bassa is a nice bay with a very commercial beach club; CBBC. Lots of things to do, lots of beatiful people are there and they want to be seen. Nothimg to be awkward about, but to be there will cost you big time! Enjoy but be warned",
          "Wonderful scenic bay that I recommend visiting. Sometimes it is crowded but still it is really worth...",
          "Very clean beach close to the boats. Close to the main strip, clean sand, nice and quiet. Hope to visit again during the summer",
          "Stopped off at this lovely beach as part of a catamaran trip along the coast. Beautiful beach with gorgeous aqua water which was still quite warm and lovely soft sand. Beach surrounded by pine woodland. Very pretty. We had great fun wading in to the water where shoals of",
          "Is it Calabasa or Cala Bassa, that is a question. It is one of the stunning and beautiful beaches in Ibiza, Balearic Islands, Spain. It was not very busy since it was off season, but still many people flock to this beach to worship the sun and the sea. It is one of the good",
          "After visiting the beach with my friend on my last visit to Ibiza, I took my family when holidaying here. It was I remembered, beautiful views and clear water. My daughters snorkeled in the shallow water and we took advantage of the bar which is on the beach. A lovely way to",
          "We spent a great day on the beach. We were on a family trip with a 4 months baby, so need some extra comfort. No chairs and umbrella available at the beach, the only option was a bed and table at the club which cost us \u20ac100, but for the confort and service provided was worth",
          "A top quality beach that was reached by boat from Sant Antonio, it was a top class beach club, although we did cheat a bit by eating & drinking at the cheaper take-away. The beach club it self appeared to be top notch",
          "Fantastic beach. Water taxi from San Antonio Bay for 9 euros return. Beautiful clear warm water with gently sloping sandy beach. Did see a couple of jellyfish though!! The sunbeds are 20 euros each and 10 euros for a parasol. If you chose to use the sunbeds on the beach",
          "Great boat trip and somewhere to spend an excellent day on the beach. Lovely restaurants amongst the trees, also bars for a drink and snack.",
          "This is a great beach, not particularly big and sprawling and gets very busy we loved it water is clear and mostly sandy ! Downside is most of the beach bars are to expensive for the \u201c Hoypoloy\u201d as they are Sponsored by an expensive champagne company and seem to cater for the",
          "This is a beautiful spot by the sea, served by small and regular ferries and visited by the glass bottom catamarans. A good restaurant is nearby, but it's nice to take a picnic and just laze in the sun. There is a regular bus service that starts early and finishes late so you",
          "This would be a great beach if everything was owned by the Cala Bassa beach club. Loads of sun beds when we got there but you had to book online and they weren\u2019t cheap. Everything was owned and managed by them, even the ladies and gents walking round selling fruit (not cheap)",
          "I love this place, especially out of season when it\u2019s quieter and not overrun with high priced drinks and food just a stunning beach with beautiful surroundings and bay.",
          "In one word, Fabulous! go and see for yourself, crystal waters views, like paradise. Probably gets busy in the summer and no shade. Can hire sunbeds and umbrella",
          "Fantastic place to visit all the family loved it amazing views will be returning next year without a doubt",
          "Clear waters, golden sand and a tasty restaurant for a bite to eat, you can cliff dive snorkel or just bask in the heat and enjoy the busy vibes",
          "We visited CBBC for drinks, lunch and massages. All were amazing and worth the visit alone but the chilled day dj was well worth the visit!",
          "This place is beautiful polite the food is great and everything is clean! Busy during the day which adds to the atmosphere! They play great music all day adds to a great day drinking and eating experience! It\u2019s was that good we went there twice on our short stay! Price wise",
          "I've been coming here for the past 6 summers and it really feels like home to me. Best months to enjoy are from the end of March to May and September to end of October. Three different restaurants and vendors sell fruit and drinks on the beach in case you don't want to bring",
          "This was a lovely beach, but very pricey and full of posers. In speedos\ud83e\udd2a bus connection is a nightmare best to drive or get a taxi once in the water you are surrounded by fish only wish I had an underwater camera to take some pics of the fish I would not return I think it\u2019s a",
          "Great beach, that's why it can get busy. Amazing clear, warm water. I can't visit Ibiza without calling here.",
          "I have been going to Ibiza for 40 years but have never visited Calla Bassa, so this year we thought we`d give a go from our usual beach, Salinas, what a waste of time , paid 5 euros to park , on the beach there was sun loungers with no one on , i enquired to be told they were",
          "loved the boat trip there, the beach is amazing.. my son and daughter thoroughly enjoyed themselves. restsurants were good too",
          "It was a lovely beach, however, it was very busy. It has nice views though and you can go on the rocks and take some beautiful photos. It also has a nice cafe for refreshments.",
          "Went there after lunch time, the CBBC was full so stayed on the beach but got drinks and pizza from their restaurant. Bit busy on the beach, possibility to do jet sky and other activities. Stay in the CBBC or close to it I suggest, so you can enjoy the music and the drinks",
          "Lovely place, great restaurants and bars, water crystal clear, easy parking, the view it's breath taking, great atmosphere.",
          "Beautiful beach.picked the wrong day to go as was overcast but still clear blue sea.if it so stunning when it's overcast must be amazing in the sunshine.worth a trip there ferry from San Antonio bay 9\u20acreturn about half an hours ride",
          "Great place to relax in the day. The restaurant is reasonably priced. Food is nice and staff are friendly. Later in the evening it\u2019s a perfect place to watch the sunset without the crowds. Bring your own food and drink as the restaurant is shut by then.",
          "We\u2019ve been coming to Cala Bassa for a few years now and it\u2019s clear that they are investing a lot of \u00a3\u00a3 here. There is a large car park with plenty of space. 5 euros to park but you get given a voucher for a free beer so not actually expensive at all. There\u2019s a board walk that",
          "Nice beach with a nice beach bar-restaurant , hosts small shops and has massage facilities Nice view and nature with clear waters BUT very few sun beds for so many people!!!",
          "The place is beautiful but with sooo many people the water was not very clean. The Cala Bassa Beach Club is beautiful, but I suggest to come to the beach at the beginning or the end of the season, not in August",
          "Beach was nice pleanty of bars i recommend the tour of formentera they are known for ther wheat and fige but stuning scenery cala bassa is nice but you cant use the toilet in any bar unless u are s client",
          "The picture showed a beautiful sandy beach with turquoise sea. The reality was correct except that it was absolutely full of people, even putting 1 towel down took ages to find a spot. Lovely sand and sea though and if you want to spoil yourself and spend a few hundred quid on",
          "Beautiful beach and crystal clear waters, but over commercial at the beach bar and very busy. Loads of looky looky men around all day",
          "We were dumped at this beach on a day trip. The beach was so busy you couldn't move or lay your towels down, the sand was full of pine needles and cigarette butts. The African sellers never left you along within about 20 minutes I was asked by about 13 different men whether I",
          "Great beach and great crowd! Loved it! Great place to spend a day there. Very clean and clear water beach front. My only recommendation is to carry a pair of footwear that you can wear in water. There are parts of beach has rocky surface and may hurt you",
          "Way to crowded but if you just walk along the rocks you have some nice views and a possibility to do some cliff diving",
          "Nice beach, convenient parking, sometimes windy. Too much crowded in August. I suggest to have lunch at the beach club.",
          "Great beach but spoilt by the sheer mass of August holidaymakers ( us included) . Left after a hour .",
          "We spent a few hours there in August. The beach is EXTREMELY crowded - it\u2019s not very large so every bit of sand is covered by people with towels. The beach club provides some sunbeds but the beach is so crowded with people on the ground with their towels that it does not put you",
          "we took the boat ferry from san antoinio cost us 8 euros return and took about 20 mins . the beach is nice can get very busy in the height of the season . the water was very clear and the beach clean , as there are only a couple of places to eat you are a bit limted on choice",
          "This is one of the beaches that you should include in your list. It's a very beautiful beach with plenty of people.",
          "We hired a small boat and sailed over to Cala Bassa from San Antonio. Very beautiful area. Clear waters. It was a little busy but we went at weekend I think a lot of locals visit on Sunday. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5. I swam quite far out and got a very nasty sting",
          "We drove to Cala Bassa and chilled out there for the day. The music being played is pretty chilled out music and the whole place is all relaxed and a beautiful setting and place. Brilliant to go with friends, couples or even families. the Beach Club does amazing food and very",
          "Really nice beach and clear water. Definitely busy in the water and on the beach but didn\u2019t distract from the place . Really nice facilities inc toilets and a informal bar/cafe for those not wanting to go into the beach club. The beach felt safe leaving things on too.",
          "Beautiful beach but absolutely crammed with people. If you want somewhere quiet go elsewhere. People playing their music and smoking meant that if you were not into that you had little choice but to listen and inhale. Amazingly clear water",
          "Lovely beach but very busy. We paid for the CBBC sun loungers for the day which was nice but I wouldn't rush back-it was nice to be off the sand as it was so busy but not really worth the crazy price. Would have been just as nice on the 'cheaper beds'",
          "It is not a very special place but it is a nice place and it is not far from sant Antoni where we stayed",
          "Had a day here Booked a double bed and table Lunch for 2 and a bottle of wine \u00a3250 Got there by bus which was rammed full Staff ok ...all a bit unorganised when we got there Very expensive in little beach shop bout 3 beach dresses but each about \u00a380 and regretted it when I",
          "Beach is great. Get there early for a good spot. Get an umbrella for shade rather than paying 50 euros to the local beach shack and also bring your own bevies in a cooler unless you want to pay 5euro for a coke.",
          "Huge sandy beach, perfect with kids as the water is nice and calm. There are also rocks to jump off, if you are up for it. We also did some snorkelling, which was nice and quiet as most people tend to stay near to the beach We were there on a very busy day but there were still",
          "The beach is not that big and gets very crowded with everyone on top of each other. The prices for drinks and snacks is far too over priced They do have some very up market sun beds , but at \u00a3150 for the day even with champagne thrown in was out of my price range Oh and dont",
          "Very busy beach, clean sand and clear blue sea. You need to book sun loungers in advance of your visit to be comfortable and take advantage of the sun parasols at CBbc (be prepared to save for this if you don't have more money than sense!) - we were quoted 175 euros, though a",
          "There is parking right next to the beach for 5 Euros. The beach is really nice and the water amazing. However, it is very very busy. You are packed in like sardines. Unless you don't mind laying next to a random stranger, then this is definitely not the place for you. You are so",
          "Good cove, clean water although a bit crowded. The CBbc (restaurant) is quite a nice one. Not very expensive and friendly. Nice views to the beach.",
          "This place could be great. If you could see it for people. If you could, it would look lovely but it is crowded, very crowded. We took our own umbrella and towels, the only loungers available on the beach are the expensive beach club ones. There are a few people selling",
          "Beautiful beach with great services. It is one of the most expensive beach at Ibiza, but worth to go there at least once.",
          "Got the boat here from San Antonio. Boats are on the hour and \u20ac8 return which I found very reasonable. On arriving at the beach it was obviously overcrowded and sadly the staff at CBBC were not interested in accommodating us (which we would of payed) but we decided to set up",
          "You should visit cala bassa if you are in ibiza, it is one of the most crowded sandy beaches there. A lot of restaurants available, beach beds and umbrellas available for rental with service.",
          "Started coming to this beach in the 80s as a child. It is truly a beautiful beach with lovely clear water and backed by trees. However, it is now a 'Beach Club' where a sunbed is 20Euros (and despite this high price all were reserved on our visit so we had to sit on the sand)",
          "To be honest, one of the most beautiful beaches I have seen in my life. But it is very expensive. If you have the money and don't mind expensive a little bit much for a glass of beer, then go for it. Also it looked like a beach for older people, not for younger guys.",
          "We had a vip exp' we got a twin bed at the beach. The service is the best. It's 40 min from the city center but dont wait 1 of the bast",
          "Very nice but over rated. Very expensive to hire a 2 bed/brolly combo. \u20ac170, yes \u20ac170, but you would get a bottle of bubbly with that. Very very over crowded and tonnes of looky looky men/hair braiders, pests in the end, will give this beach a very wide birth next time. You NEED",
          "We went late June and arrived about 10am by 12 the beach was mobbed. Its a very small beach with a large beach club that attracts a lot of people so it gets very very busy. We left just after 12. Make sure you bring your own umbrellas if you have small children as there aren't",
          "Went by bus to Cala Bases from San Antonio Bay. Took 30 mins and 2 euros. When we got there the beach was full and even so very little shade. We tried to get beds/shade at the beach club but that was full. We came back on the next bus. Very disappointed",
          "What a gorgeous beach. White sand and clear blue sea. Definitely the best beach I\u2019ve been to in Ibiza. Wish we\u2019d known you had to book beds though. They were all reserved so we had to sit on the sand .",
          "We travelled quite a bit around the world however Ibiza was for some reason never on the list. We went to this beach club and were so happily surprised. The staff was great and the location cannot get any better. Best sangria we ever had - and I grew up in Spain Whatever you",
          "Crystal clear waters, I prefer it in quieter months but lovely beech very clean and tidy within a short distance from san Antonio by either car or boat.",
          "Cala Bassa is a lovely bay with a sandy beach and trees in the hinterland. The whole place has been taken over by the Cala Bassa Beach Club, catering for people who like to pay big money for big mattress sun loungers, chilled champagne and oysters. You get the picture. Even in",
          "one of the more beautiful sandy beaches in Ibiza, it has clear water, it's big and has a bar and restaurant",
          "Lovely beach with crystal blue water, great beach club. Easy acces to water also for kids, good athmosphere an summer vibes thanks to the ibiza lounge music in the background, parking 5 euro or walk a few minutes and park for free",
          "Really scenic and lovely but need to get there early for a good spot. Restaurant smelt lovely. Toilets clean overall. We got the bus there which was a bit unreliable with timings which given that they only run every hour and a quarter was not great. Waited hour and half to get",
          "Beach is lovely the sea is so clean and refreshing. The white wine sangria is a must try! Also ate at the cafe restaurant which was nice moderately priced lunch",
          "Fantastic day out, gorgeous beach, great food, fab atmoshphere highly recommend this place. The Cala Bassa Beach Club provides food and drink at difference levels all the way along the cove.",
          "If the crowd was so dense in late May I would hate to see the beach in high season. Lovely clear water, long stretch of beach with towels on every inch of space. I decided to skip the beach club and walk with my own picnic, which was a good idea as the beds are behind rows of",
          "One of the nicest beaches, clean, shallow waters and plenty of space. Cala Bassa beach club occupies a lot of the shaded areas but little gems are still to the had. Worth a visit - the one thing that lets the beach down are the number of hawkers. Every 2 minutes someone tries",
          "Short but sweet.... by far the best little beach in the San Antonio area with out having to travel far, catch the taxi boat or walk. Well worth a day out.",
          "Get the bus it\u2019s cheap to get to ,but take packed lunch very expensive at the beach bar . Busses run on the hour so get the bus timetable",
          "Whilst this is undoubtedly a lovely bay,forget spontaneity! We got the first bus out in the morning and arrived,with no one else there to be informed that all the beds were reserved! And you had to book in advance and they had no bookings for the rest of the week.",
          "First time I have visited cala bassa and I have to say it's stunning!! Will defiantly be visiting again.",
          "Hidden gem, we got a boat here. Clear waters, white sand and beautiful views. Peaceful enjoyable place",
          "This place is hugeeee... its just to big and the staff isn't friendly at all! The beach is full with people who had a hangover from last night in at antoni I guess!",
          "Lovely beach! We visited several during our stay in Ibiza and this was one of our favourites. Very clean and nice for swimming or just paddling and nice views if you walk further than than the beach. Apparently it is quite expensive to buy food and drink at the beach but this",
          "We took a water taxi to this beach from San Antonio, it only took around half an hour. The beach was glorious with crystal clear water, you could swim out really far and still see the bottom. As you get in to the water, there are loads of fish around your feet which seem really",
          "Caught bus to this beach from San Antonio. Lovely beach but total rip off. The only sunbeds here are owned by the restaurants & you are expected to have food or drinks from them, which is fair enough but they charge extortionate prices. The cheapest starter I saw on one of the",
          "Great beach - we go here every time we are on the island, for a great day chilled at the sea! Water is great and clear to go in and a very very clean beach!",
          "This beach is one of the nicest in Ibiza. Great sunbeds to choose from and interesting views. There is a ferry service. Great swimming beach",
          "Such a good time In Cala Bassa with my friends. Lovely place, Especially the water it s simply amazing.",
          "Well worth the \u20ac8 boat trip from San Antonio- views are stunning ! Definitely go early and enjoy the gorgeous CB Beach club drinks and amazing food.",
          "We took the \u20ac8 ferry across and enjoyed a \u20ac20 CBbc club sun bed with service and spent the day drinking and chatting enjoying the view. We walked across the the restaurant with CBbc where we had the paella and sangria which I have to say were delicious. We really enjoyed",
          "Looked at the best beaches in Ibiza to take a family. If you go early (before 1000hrs) then there is parking on the road. Got down to Bassa later and you have to pay \u20ac5 for parking (first one on the island). The beach is really crowded but beautiful, however, there are so",
          "We visited this beach while on a 3 hr boat trip around the bay. Unfortunately we only had one hour and wanted much longer as it was beautiful. Will visit it for longer on our next trip to Ibiza.",
          "Crystal clear water, clean sand stunning views. Went in April so not too crowded. Free parking available nearby",
          "Amazing beach. It\u2019s very beautiful. You have to pay to park the car 5\u20ac all day. The beach is not very big so you should go early to find a good spot.",
          "Our trip late february brought us to Cala Bassa; a secluded beach with a classy beachclub (which was not open yet; i think this will happen aprox may). The surroundings are great with the rocks and the lazy backlands. The beach is white sandy and the colours of the water are 50",
          "Your basic white sand beach, a lot of people, possibility to 'bake' on your own towel. Good bus line to and from the hotel.",
          "Gorgeous beach! Full of people loved it \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc great spot for sun! Got the taxi boat over from San Antonio only took like 10mins and was around \u20ac8 from what I can remember\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "We walked along this beach as were walking the coast. It looked a very pretty and popular beach, very clean and tidy. There was a little caf\u00e9 and sunbeds to hire. We didn't stop but it looked very nice.",
          "Went on bus from outside hotel as a day out was nice cove.only stayed for a hour.buses are about every half hour.stayed on past hotel and went back to bus station. Were there are toilets.no cafe but drink machine, cafe not far from station.",
          "Went for a boat trip on a Saturday and the small beach was packed with tourists and local people. Would have been better to go on a week day perhaps.",
          "Cala Bassa beach is small but beautiful, the Cala Bassa beach club is situated right on the beach. I never got anything from there but I am sure you can just go in for drinks and food. The water is turquoise clear and nice to swim in. It\u2019s probably one of the nicest beaches",
          "Our boat Called in on our way to Cala Comte and we actual see spaces you could put your own towel on, a bit different to our summer break a few years ago, Paul S go to Cala Comte next time your in Ibiza it's far superior,",
          "Always a great place to spend the day ,take a picnic if you don't want to fork out for overpriced food and drinks.but some body please regulate how many beach sellers are allowed on at a time ,it's a constant stream",
          "Probably the nicest beach in this part of Ibiza. You can get here by road or water bus. There are water sport activities for hire and a food / drink outlet which we thought was good value.",
          "The beach generally was a disappointment. It\u2019s small with large rocky outcrops and sun beds which take up pretty much all the sand. Be warned the sun beds aren\u2019t free or even cheap, they are 20 Euro\u2019s for a back row bed and 175 Euro\u2019s for 3 seater bed with a complimentary bucket",
          "Visited this beach twice in one week ! Lovely calm waters and nice atmosphere Would definitely recommend it",
          "Ignore the horrendous price tags of CBBC (\u20ac55 for two loungers and umbrella) and bunk on the sand and enjoy a little bit of paradise . If there is a better beach and sea cove near by, let me know! Go to Cala Bassa and just enjoy crystal waters, warm seas, and soft sand. Love",
          "This is well worth visiting as the views are stunning and easy to get to by bus although i walked from port torrent which i enjoyed. Go prepared with food and drink if you don't want to pay excessive prices at the beach bars. Sun beds 10 euros.",
          "Nice spot but too busy even in October ! We struggled to find a spot and charged 5 euros for parking Water was nice for swimming but a lot nicer places to visit",
          "This was a great beach, just a short trip from St Antonio. It filled up quite quickly, but sunloungers were quite expensive. Food and drink was served all day.",
          "Remote place for just a few people. Nice hidden beach accessible by car and boat. Can be packed during high season",
          "Visited Cala bassa for the morning. Very nice beach in beautiful surroundings. But boy does it seem like it\u2019s got the beautiful ones ! 10/20 euros of alounger ! 22 euros for a club sandwich, wow ! But the beach and the water is gorgeous, as is the bay . Just a shame your",
          "This is a really beautiful beach, the water is crystal clear and not too many rocks underfoot to contend with. Here's the but, it was very very busy with people going past every couple of minutes trying to sell you something which really gets to be a pain after a while. As it's",
          "Lovely place sea was amazing clear sun lounger expensive tho Boat taxi was good man was lovely Food not to bad at all Place was busy tho so wish we had gone sooner Love ibiza a beautiful place",
          "Got the boat over to Cala bassa beach for the day. Relaxing day there is a restaurant and a bar. A bit dear but if you bring your own it's not as bad :) Only one point let it down was the amount of people trying to sell towels sunglasses and other rubbish. Other than than",
          "One of the best beaches over ibiza, pure water with clear sand and easy to reach. Highly recommend. Suitable for group, family or couples.",
          "You can get a boat from San Antonio to Calla Bassa for * euro return. Beautiful golden sands. You can pay 25 euro for Sun beds with waiter service or lay a towel on the sand for free. only slight downside was Jelly Fish but you expect that in September.",
          "Beach was beautiful and the sea even more amazing. Beds of CBBC are expensive but spreading your blanket on the sand is no problem.",
          "It's a nice beach very different from the Caribbean. Water is clear and you could see fishes swimming near you. It's very rocky. It's too crowded and people selling stuff. Thy are some club bars with chilling music \ud83c\udfb6 but I prefer formentera",
          "2nd visit....and loved it even more this time. Sunbeds only \u20ac10 each. We ate from the little shack and it was lovely. Tunes were awesome and everything was perfect. Only down fall last boat is at 7pm. Wish we could have stayed longer.",
          "A stunning must do beach in Ibiza. I have been to Ibiza a few times but I had never been to this beach. I was missing out, it absolutely stunning. The sea water is crystal clear, the sand is lovely and clean. There are full amenities here too, clean toilets, shops, you can even",
          "If you like to pay \u20ac25 for a sun bed this is your place. If you want to be squashed into the free public areas of this beach, this is your place. The beach has been taken over in the last 2 years and the company have tried to make it up market. They have ruined this beautiful",
          "First visit was late in day, high tide, lots of wind, felt like a hurricane coming in but I know that sounds ridiculous if anyone has been part of one. Still, wasn't pleasant. But next visit was great. Clear water, beautiful views, cliff jumping from above the caves, plenty",
          "We travelled on bus from San Antonio about 30 mins. The sandy beach was totally rammed whether this was because it was a Sunday and locals would have been there I don't know it might be quieter during the week. Having said that we still managed to get 2 sunbeds and parasol",
          "The beach is a nice cala i recomend. But the only hamakas available cost 20 eur. The max price its clearly market there is 10 by theauthority, but they say that thats without the matress. But that hamakas cant be used with out. So.. they are charging te double of the max price",
          "We had a lovely relaxing afternoon at this beach. Th e sun loungers are pricey so most of our group laid on towels on the beach. Toilet facilities are clean. We ate at the little cafe near the ferry landing, good food at reasonable prices",
          "Lovely beach, it was very busy when we went there wasnt much space. Nice warm water and not rough. We had a drink at the beach bar which was fab, great music not too expensive.",
          "This Beach is for all ages not particularly big but stunning views, settling and glorious clear blue water! Easy accessible by road or by water taxi! Loungers limited but we just chucked towels down near the front to keep an eye on the kids! Plenty of bars and eateries had a",
          "How did the authorities think here? Lots of fancy sunbeds at ridiculous prices at the Beach club. Everybody that does not want to feel robbed have very little space to put down their towels. The beach is quite small, and absolutely packed....",
          "The beach club has practically ruined Cala Bassa. Beds back from the front \u20ac10, parasols \u20ac10. If you want beds on the beach, then it\u2019s \u20ac20. If you\u2019re happy to plonk on the sand then you\u2019re limited to a smallish section near the car park. With that said, the beach itself is",
          "Superb beach with bar restaurant and dj. Ideal place to sit and have a beer. Love watching the 'fashion show' basically a few girls modelling beach wear I even bought a few items as it is cheaper than the shops.",
          "Beach itself is OK however majority of space taken up by sunbeds for hire at 20eur each and not no ugh space elsewhere for others",
          "Caught the ferry to this lil Gem from San Antonio ( just before Ibiza Rocks bar along the prom ) 8\u20ac return to spend the day on a stunning beach is an absolute bargain and a MUST DO.",

          "Definitely worth a trip across for the say. We got a boat trip from San Antonio. Was \u20ac8 return and left at 130 (may have been an earlier one but we only asked for after lunch). Boat back at 4pm and 6pm. Lovely beach bars and restaurants. Beautiful beach and calm water.",
          "Good things + clear water Not so good: - 2 hours by bus from Ibiza - CROWDED And the beach club uses the beach to display beds and all of them are booked in advance - swimming area is limited",
          "We spent a few hours at the beach, the beach is absolutely beautiful but it was very crowed and struggled to find a spot for a sunbathe, we ended up sat on the rocks near the cafe bar. Stunning views though.",
          "I've been recommended over and over about Cala Bassa, sadly I was left a little disappointed. Cala Bassa is about a 25 minute drive from San Antonio, the Beach Itself is beautiful, sand, crystal blue waters and protected by rocks each side. This being the case it makes it very",
          "Would not recommend this beach...plenty of better choices on Ibiza. The loungers & umbrellas are exorbitantly priced! A complete rip-off. Bring your own towels and pack your lunch/refreshments because there are no reasonably priced options for getting a bite to eat. Waaay too",
          "We visited Cala Bassa Beach and the Cala Bassa Beach club at the beginning of september as a couple. Very nice nature beach, but very crowdy and sometimes annoying salesman. But overall had a wonderful time over there",
          "Only stayed for around an hour as visited on a motorbike, very nice location, calm bay.. Awesome.. Seemed to be a few bars around too. Wish we had stayed nearer here!",
          "To visit this beach is a must have. Very nice place. If you get with the car you must spent 5 EUR for parking, so it is the best to take scooter",

          "Beautiful Beach, but located in the worst touristy area of ibiza. Surrounded with two horrible, expensive restaurants with the rudest and dirtiest staff you would ever meet. So, make sure you pack everything you need before you go food, water, drinks, sunbeds/mats etc. In",
          "Went on the boat right outside our hotel. Paid 10 euros each and went to a lovely beach but had to climb up to get the views. The beach was lovely, but the boat ride itself was very nice as you took in a lot of views on the way",
          "Was not impressed at unaffordable sun loungers took up most of the sand with very little room left for people lying on towels.",
          "good family day although very tiring went to water park through tui rep well organized had a walk into town and along the beach the sand was lovely if we go back to Ibiza would look to staying in this area",

          "Cala Bassa is a beautiful beach with a Sandy Beach and clear waters. They have a food bar, showers, toilets and a massage hut. It's a little pricey to hire out loungers we paid 50 euros for 2 loungers and a parasol however if your there all day then it's worth it. We travelled",
          "Very nice beach but crowded. The beach club is fantastic but really expensive. The parking costs five euros but comes with a free corona at the beach bar. Make sure you come early.",
          "We love it here. Arrive early to get a good spot and watch the beach slowly fill up. A mixture of drop a beach towel on the floor, good quality sun beds (you hire) and then insanely good beds but pricey. Basically all price ranges to suit. Great water sports, beautiful beach and",
          "Cala Bassa is not the best beach in Ibiza, but it's easy to reach, it offers restaurants and bars, and it's very family friendly. Water is for the most part clean, so swimming there is nice!",
          "The beach is really worth a visit. I recommend to be there before 11-12 a.m. otherwise it will be to full. There is a bar/restaurant at the beach. Not sure about the their pricing. On windy days beware of fire jellyfish's, my wife got hit by it and it was a horrible pain for",

          "Calm sea about one meter deep, clean soft white sand beach with a luxurious Cala Bassa Beach Club. It's great for people who are afraid of a rough sea and prefer calm sea. You shouldn't feel disturbed by lots of people because the beach is very popular. One sunbed costs 20 \u20ac.",
          "This beach club offers everything you need - clean water, music, shower facilities, great drinks. One of the bests in Ibiza.",
          "Visited by chance one evening. Lovely beach, sunset to die for. Music playing from the restaurant on the beach and lots of families still enjoying the views at 9pm. Great place",
          "Nice beach with nearby parking for \u20ac5. Small area for snorkelling with clear waters. Main negatives: way too busy, food / drinks overpriced & topless sunbathing which isn't really appropriate in a \"family beach\"",
          "An overpriced hell hole with loud brain-damaging music, will never go again. Very average food, rude staff, absolutely packed, you literally can't navigate your way to the sea. It is still a mystery to me why people go there and pay extortionate prices for such a bad experience.",

          "Lovely beach with a nice rocky bit to explore, and a small river running off the sea where the kids enjoyed trying to catch fish. Clean toilets nearby also. We got there early, so got parked in the car park ok, but got very busy later on, best go early!",

          "Definitely go to this beach. It's beautiful. You can get a boat across for \u20ac8 return from San Antonio harbour and takes around 20mins. If there is a group of 10+ they will do you a deal for \u20ac6 return. Take a snorkel and a under water camera.",

          "Busy but stunning. We hired a car and drove here on a Saturday lunchtime. I'd advise to go midweek or early to get a good spot. Cala Bassa Beach Club was pricy but that was to be expected, lots of fresh seafood & sushi. The water was clear & calm. Such a beautiful place.",

          "we were there at a very busy time so we were not surprised to find that the beach was pretty crowded. We had a difficult time finding a spot to lay out. There were more people selling stuff on the beach than other beaches we have recently visited, which got slightly annoying.",
          "Excellent day, 8 of us had a private area complete with table for lunch. The area is beautiful, sea crystal clear, lots to do. Lunch was really special. Probably the best sea bass I have ever had and the white sangria is something to make a return trip worth while. Brilliant",

          "Went there late May, very disappointed, sun loungers appear to be controlled by the restaurants, no meal, no sun bed. The only independent sun beds we could find were 10 euros each, even though we only wanted them for appx 2/3 hours. Water was also alive with thousands of",
          "Beautiful beach and fabulous place to spend soaking up the sun. Fabulous clear waters and great facilities close to hand. This is the best beach on the island in my opinion. Great for everyone.",
          "If you're staying in St.Anyoniy this is just a 6/8 euro water taxi ride over! Totally worth it. The water is so transparent and the view, to die for. There are public restrooms and bars/restaurants along the shoreline as well.",
          "Better come early because it's getting crowded quickly after 11pm. The beach and view are beautiful. Careful with the bus. There are apparently already using the summer schedule in June.",

          "We hired a car and managed to get a little lost, ending up in Cala Bassa. What a place to be lost in! Fabulous beach, lots of restaurants/cafes etc around the bay, all linked with a shaded walk. Plenty of pine trees should you want to sit out of the sun. Really lovely place.",

          "Very nice beach for a short visit . We arrived on the ferry and thought that we could try one of the posh sunbeds but nearly all of them had been reserved by people staying at the beach club. There were a few single beds left but we did not want to pay 180\u20ac to sit on a beach .",
          "Beautiful Beach, looks like the caribbean. Easy to get to from San Antonio by boat, 8 euros return ticket which goes every hour. Lovely boat trip across!",
          "Lovely beach, no doubt about that, but a victim of it's own success, an elbow to elbow wall of people during the UK school holiday calendar, luckily the super low fare bus service runs regularly and whisked me out of there to freedom",
          "Expect a lot of people. This is one of the busiest, yet best, beaches on the island. The beach club still affords space to those that are not renting beach beds. Overall, it was a great place for a good mix of people.",
          "Cala bassa beach is dominated by the CBBC( Cala bassa beach club ) , don't left this put you off tho. arrive or leave bus or take the water taxi back to San Antonio , whatever way you will enjoy the views! Soft sandy beaches & gorgeous crystal clear waters make this a magnet",

          "I visited Cala Bassa beach with my girlfriend in May 2017, staying in San Antonio we got the boat ferry which cost \u20ac8 return ticket from San Antonio Port and dropped us right to the edge of the beach. The beach was beautiful with white sands and clear water, with a nice bar",
          "Easy to go by taking a Taxi boat at San Antonio's port by \u20ac8 round-trip every hour mostly. Beach is great with a fantastic sea view. Water is absolutely clear and proper to swim in. There's only one beach-club-restaurant which is nice but not cheap at all.",

          "Easy access from San Antonni by bus which takes about 25mins. You will know when get off as it is the terminus for the bus. Limited choice of restaurant s and bars as most of it appears to be owned by the same company. But still a nice place to visit with easy access to beach .",

          "Really lovely beach which was really quiet when we visited on 3rd April 2017. There were about 7 other groups on the beach and the water was crystal clear! Definitely worth a visit if you have a car.",
          "Fairly pricey, but well worth it. The island is kept in good nick, as the staff never stop cleaning up after us beach bums. The changing rooms and toilets are utterly spotless, someting which I look for when I travel. Fab drinks and friendly people, of an evening, a dj plays",

          "Every time I go to Ibiza we always do a boat trip to cala bassa, you get to stay in the little island for a while then get the boat back to San Antonio It's a beautiful beach But not much to do there The boat trip to it is good enough for me.. Great views",
          "The most calm and relaxing cala in Ibiza. Ideal for a walk, hike or just simply a day at the beach. (Cala Bassa Beach Club is quite fancy and not the cheapest but you can have a beer at a resonable price)",

          "The beach itself is really beautiful, the water is green-blue and clean. It is in a sort of lagoon so that it's not very big but it deserves a visit. I visited off-season at the end of october and I didn't found it to be overcrowded but I suppose in the summer it could be a",
          "Nice beach! Unfortunately has been taken over by the rich and noisy tourist! Chiringito id really a nice restaurant! With friendly service and nice foid!",
          "Cala Bassa in itself is rather pretty - clear blue water, soft white sands and pretty hills, but it's overcrowded and overpriced. You are almost literally elbow to elbow with other people. All sheltered spots are taken by rental loungers and sofas and the prices are ridiculous",
          "Una de las playas mejores en Ibiza. Hay mucha gente pero la aqua fue limpia. A very nice beach, a lot of people there but water was amazing clean with some fishes around :-)",
          "Overall a great experience. If you're looking to go for a quick swim you don't need to rent sun chairs or umbrellas. The beach was clean and safe. Water was very suitable for snorkelling as it was very clear. Also, there are clear markings for safe swimming areas.",

          "I visited this beach after being told all about it on an island cruise and thank god i did. The outdoor restaurant although expensive was well worth it just to sit eating and drinking and letting the real Ibiza sink in. The beach is immaculate with crystal clear waters and white",
          "We took an unplanned trip round from San Antonio. It was towards the end of the day so was quietening down. It was lovely having some good nature trails along the coastline getting you away from the hustle and bustle.",

          "Came here on my 1st ever lads holiday in 1989. The beach was the same back then...clean and tidy but the prices have changed tho!!! Catch the boat fro San Antonio to Cala Bassa and enjoy the cooling breeze on the ocean. Great day out",
          "We went here after reading the top Calas on the Island. It was not really that nice, the sea was not as blue as anticipated and it was just a bit tacky - probably because of the shadow cast by the Cala Bassa Beach Club nearby which seemed like it had peaked decades ago looking",

There are a lot of lucky lucky men selling stuff snd it can get to",

          "Loved the beach here. Beautiful. A gem on the isle. BEWARE OF THE CALA BASSA BEACH CLUB. The staff are rude and they only want the people they deem to be their kind of people to stay there. They will tell you that the beds are \u20ac20 but when you say you'll have one they tell you",

          "The beach view from top of mountain was fabulous. Water is very clean and good enough to enjoy portable snorkeling. Rocks around the beach make the place more attractive. I will visit the place with my friends someday.",
          "Cala Saladeta is one of the best spots I've ever seen. The only problem is that in August is chock full of people... If you can go there in a different period, good for you! Water is amazingly crystal clear...",
          "No direct parking possible. There is a shuttle bus transfer relatively close to the beach. Don't know how much it costs. The parking area and waiting zone for the bus do not offer any shadow.",
          "Amazing but at this time of year jam packed could hardly get on the beach! Mini bus from San An bus station (if you can get on it!!)",
          "One can jump in to the sea, the beach looks beautiful when your approaching it by boat. Can be reached by boat from Sant Antoni for 9 euros per head.",
          "Absolutely loved crossing to cala Saladeta, which is accessible only through a cliff from cala Salada. A small stretch of sand, and two guys set up selling caipirinhas and mojitos - water was clear and everyone was just chilling until 7pm. Just to note, there's absolutely no",
          "Wonderful with clear water and white sand =) If you like to swim and you love nature, you need to reach Cala Saladeta.",
          "found this beach to be relaxing and a lovely excuse to lay by the beach! we had taken a ice box with snacks and refreshments... as it becomes quite expensive buying drinks and food all day",
          "Water is amazing and I loved jumping from Cliffs. Easy parking and what I like the most not too overcrowded.",
          "Close to Sant Antoni, but recommend to come early. About 12.00 there is so many people, parking is full. The view from up is beautiful, water is crystal clear.",
          "It is a very nice beach. If you take the bus you need to hike a bit up and down on rocks, so be prepared. The sand is hot, so take your flip-flops, your own umbrella and a towel otherwise it will be too sunny and you can't rent any deck chair or umbrella.",
          "its really recommended , clear water , big shallow area very nice mood and beautiful nature surroundings with nice rock formations , a lot of small and tiny fish around the rocks under the water , just be ware of the jelly fish , but over all it was the best",
          "Favourite beach in ibiza- worth every footstep on the stairs taking there. Really clear water and nice light sand (not too many laying place on the beach for big crowd tho)",
          "Difficult to get to, you either have to rock climb or go over a steep cliff, but the views are worth it. Beautiful beach with crystal clear water. No sunbeds, small area so I can imagine in the height of summer finding somewhere to sit will be tricky. Wouldn't spend all day here",
          "Uau! Amazing beach with clear water! We came here in the morning (around 9 am), so the beach is almost empty at that time and the water is clear. I love the fact that to access to some parts you still need rock-climbing (if you want or go around). Also there are all the time",
          "Watched the sun going down over the horizon whilst listening to the waves gently lapping against the pebbly shore. There are a few fishermen's huts with gnarled wooden doors and a small jetty where they pull their boats into the water. The cove is small and once the few other",
          "Beautiful beach with some good rocks to jump off but beware if you are prudish there are many nudists wandering around.",
          "It was the best beach we saw after the ones in Formentera. The water is so clear and the green space around it make it look marvellous. It looked like paradise on earth. It is a must see for everyone that visits Ibiza. In April the water is not that warm, so we did not get in",
          "In the old days this beach could only be visited by car and a hike but now I believe there is a bus in the main season. There is no restaurant or toilets once you get there so take a picnic. There's sometimes a makeshift bar with guy making and selling cocktails. The water",
          "Water is cold, but is worth it a swim there even in April, transparent water, very calm, like a swimming pool. It is not very easy to access but it is an amazing and relaxing place. I think is getting more famous because was kind of busy, but still, an amazing landscape",
          "Gorgeous, pleaceful and safely tucked away from the crowds. There are two beaches, separated by rocks and caves, only connected by a passage above them. A nice, pristine little place. Go see it.",
          "Absolutely lovely beach hidden round the corner from Cala Salada. We used the sat nav to Cala Salada and then walked down the stairs to the cove. We then clambered across the rocks round the corner to Cala Saladeta which is just beautiful. Clear waters, very relaxing and perfect",
          "Clear blue, calm sea with white sand. Rocks to climb and small cliffs to jump in from. Peaceful and an ideal place to relax. Small car parking area at the top of some steps. One Disabled space that I could see leading on to the first part of the beach. The second part",
          "This is one of the most beautiful beaches close-ish to San Antonio Ibiza. Although it has no services (there is a restaurant on the nearby Cala Salada beach about 10 mins walk) and can get very busy in peak season this a great place to paddle, swim and snorkel.",
          "Cala Saladeta is a small beautiful cove next to cala salada. It has crystalline waters excellent for swimming and snorkeling and soft white sand. It is quite difficult to get to either over some very slippy rocks, down a steep path or by boat, but worth it. The only thing",
          "Didnt saw a singe person to assist to the way to beach. No good directions too. Had to go back 500 meters as didnt know where i was, GPS not working, on a hilly area with no one around.",
          "Cala Saladeta is supposed to be a less crowded little beach on the other side of the rocks from Cala Salada, but it seems like the more popular of the two now. Get there early to beat the crowds, the view from the top of the rocks is amazing! The climb over is short but kind of",
          "Its a small sandy beach between the rocks, its not a big beach, there is a lagune so you can walk in the sea for some fifty meters before you can swim. No facilitys o n the beach, bar/restaurant/shop about 100 meters from the beach. Good parkin area",
          "The best beach ever. If you go there around 9am there will be no one there and it's awesome. Clear water, fine sand. The best thing about it is the cliff you can jump from.",
          "Led by the amazing Ruben, we embarked on his boat for an epic adventure on the high seas!! Ruben made it fun for all four of us and the trip is well worth the three hours spent with him. Great snorkelling, so checkout #SUPBoatIbiza",
          "really nice beach, but so busy (it was August). we managed a few hours but definitely worth a trip when you are in ibiza",
          "Skip the cherenguita next door and trek over here to enjoy beach side mojitos and empanadas with the locals.",
          "Beautiful beach tooked away north of San Antonio, we got a water taxi to this beach which was busy but we had a great day diving off the rocks and chilling on the beach",
          "My partner and I, before we travelled we search in trip Advisors thing's to do. We've checked beaches in Ibiza and Cala Saladeta came up as one of the most visited and beautiful beaches around San Antoni Portmany. We got bus 34 that runs every half hour and it only took us",
          "well worth the long trek to the beach, beautiful beach and scenery. Limited facilities when there but people supply food, drinks on tap privately and this adds to the atmosphere. Good for families with teenagers but wouldn't recommend it for family with young children.",
          "Amazing trail and clear green/blue water. Wonderful place, yet quite small beach and so many people!",
          "A truly beautiful beach that is well worth the journey, the clear blue seas and some toy awesome views, a great day out at the beach",
          "When people picture Ibiza they ser Cala Saladeta: small, non commercial, mostly with locals, green and blue beautiful waters. You go on a short hike before you arrive there, and the view from up there is just breathtaking. Don't miss it.",
          "We got to the main parking area for 9:45 and walked down to Cala Salada and then over to Cala Saladeta. There were about ten sets of people already on the beach but it was very relaxing. People just kept on arriving though and by 3:30 we'd had enough - too busy. My advice:",
          "This was our absolute favorite beach in all of Ibiza! The boys enjoyed jumping off the rocks into the warm, blue water below. The snorkeling along the rocks was amazing! Make sure you have water shoes. A few tips... We arrived late. Around 1pm. Get here early! Had to park far",
          "Arrived at 10:00 and we were able to park in the purpose built car park and make or way down the steps to Cala Salada beach (the more organised beach with sun beds/showers and a restaurant but a little shingley). Take the path at the up and over the back of the cliff, following",
          "I found this beach simply by googling nice beaches in Ibiza. It's a bit of a hike across some rocks/a small cliff (wear appropriate shoes), but it's beautiful. The water is crystal clear and the view is beautiful. Go very early as the beach itself is not very big at all and",
          "Cala Saladeta is one of the many beaches in Ibiza. Is it a must visit, probably not. But if you are in the area why not just pop by for a relaxing time at the beach before heading off to your next destination or activity. :)",
          "The most incredible views walking between Cala Salada and Cala Saladeta. Truly stunning. Very exotic and tropical looking. A must see! Taxi or hire car a must. Or one can use a bus with a little more walking. Not for those less able to stand/walk or with young children. Wear a",

It is in the municipality of Sant Josep de sa Talaia and is 5.0 miles (8.0 km) west of the village of Sant Agust\u00ed des Vedr\u00e0.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe beach of Cala Comte is a small sandy beach with several small coves near by. The beach has shallow clear blue and turquoise water which is kept that way by the constant flow of sea currents in the area. From the beach there are views of the small islands of S\u2019Espartar Illa des Bosc and Sa Conillera. The beach to the western side of the rocky headland is popular with families, whilst the beach to the eastern side is an unofficial nudist spot.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nLocated on the crown of the small headland, there is a restaurant and shop along with toilet facilities. From the headland there are views across to several small islands. During the summer months the beach is patrolled by lifeguards. Behind the headland on the cliff tops there is a car park which becomes extremely busy in the summer.\n\n\n=== Blue Flag ===\nIn 2010 Cala Conte was one of the fifteen beaches on the island to have been awarded a prestigious Blue Flag.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe beach is in the municipality of Sant Josep de sa Talaia but the nearest large island resort is Sant Antoni. To get to the beach from Sant Antoni there are several options. It is a well signposted drive with brown tourist signs from the PM 803 road at the nearby village of Sant Agust\u00ed des Vedr\u00e0. There is also a frequent bus service in the summer from both Sant Antoni and Ibiza town.\nThere are also regular ferry boat departures  regularly San Antonio harbour and various hotels along the Sant Antoni Bay during the summer months to the beach.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "This is a great beach on the west coast of Ibiza. We visited for a few hours - it does get crowded and I recommend getting there early. The beds and umbrellas are extortionately priced and we ended up lying on towels on the sand which isn't ideal. There were no jellyfish in the",
          "We went here by the float your boat beach cruise and stopped here for 1 hour only , but we liked it so much that we went back a few days after the excursion. There are 3 little beaches so plenty to choose from",
          "Fabulous place to sit and watch the sunset. Lovely small beach setting with fabulous bars playing the music of old Ibiza Vibe",
          "This is a must if you are in Ibiza. People will gather in this area to watch an incredible sunset, to have a drink while listening to some music or to have dinner in the restaurant. Doesn't matter which option you choose, Cala Comte really is beautiful.",

          "We planned to go to Cala Comte with our three children and decided to go to decathalon for some full face snorkels beforehand. I\u2019m so glad we did. The kids were in the clear sea all day looking at and swimming with the fish! Beautiful waters and views!! Bit small so you can",
          "We found the \"sandy\" beach too crowed. We eventually walked all the way around the bay and pitched up on one of the fishermen huts. This area was much more peaceful, with no crowds but no sand. There is lots of free parking available just before the beach. Would only visit again",
          "It\u2019s a place I like but don\u2019t expect anything fancy for this is a cool place to chill out in a relaxed environment where things are a bit messy but nobody cares . Good sushi or fried calamari It\u2019s a shame that one can not go from the boat anymore as one could before . They",
          "Unfortunately the day we went was a tricky spot to swim cos of strong waves and jelly fish... but it\u2019s beautiful",

          "Lovely beach. Just too commercial and pestered constantly by lookie lookie men and women. No place to lay down and very expensive for beds and drinks, even water. Go to local beach instead",

          "The first impression when you arrive at Cala Comte is one of a super crowded place, but don't give up: try to find a spot and you will enjoy the most turquoise water in Ibiza. Swimming there was a real pleasure: the water was so clear, plus if you have a mask you will observe",

          "Beautiful beach/cove. its one of my favourite in Ibiza. The sand is golden and very clean. The sea is a crystal blue/green colour. The coves offer shade. There is a restaurant with a terrace, DJ, and market style shop. The car park is free and just a 2 min walk from the beach.",
          "We had the most perfect evening on a beautiful beach watching the sunset. Went early (around 5) as we were told it got busy and boy did it get busy! Take a picnic & just chill. We heard lots of moaning about the restaurant so glad we chose this option. It was truly a night that",
          "Beautiful scenery, extremely busy and somewhat overcrowded. Car parking gets very full therefore overspill areas located a short walk from the beach. Beautiful views of the coastline but you will be luck to find a spot to place your towel as it gets packed. Couple of restaurants",

          "Most gorgeous beach in Ibiza I have been to. We arrived early so were able to get three beds and two umbrellas for 50 euros, was worth it as we spent all day there. It did get extremely busy but we expected this so arrived early. Cost 18 euros to get there in cab from San",
          "Beautiful crystal clean water! Super crowded and noisy... loved the beach but would like to go bk in a quieter time. Didn\u2019t feel very relaxed for the couple of hours there. Parking is easy and there are a couple of restaurants with amazing views.",

          "Gorgeous beach, aqua sea... not as large as expected, but a stunning place. Beach was very crowded, and water is deeper than some other beaches in the island. We had to negotiate a few local jellyfish too. Bar overlooking the bay is a great place for a few drinks.",
          "Very nice place, with crystal water and nice beach. The space is not large unfortunately so I guess it might be much better in mid/low season. The Restaurant is very nice and is serving good quality food and drinks.",

          "I was meeting people in San Antonio so took a taxi to Cala Conta (31 euro) and the local bus from there to San Antonio. From the top of the beach the views are stunning. There are 2 beaches - one rocky and one sandy. Lots of people - more on the sandy side but still able to",
          "For me this is the best Cala in Eivissa. The water is Cristal clear and the scenery is magic. We go every time we are in the island. We are glad that now they have removed the company that was renting boas and water bikes and taking a big area of the beach.",
          "What a beautiful area! Took a taxi to Cala Comte - quick and convenient! Make sure to make return accommodations as there is no taxi stand or taxis for after the sunset! Three restaurants - one is a self appeared to be a self service and the other two required reservations.",

          "Stopped here on a little Vespa trip around various Ibiza beaches. Beach is really nice and secluded by the high rocks. We walked down to the beach but didn\u2019t spend any time sunbathing as it was really windy. I would definitely like to return one day though!",
          "We decided to take the public bus to this beach for a few hours. It was a very lively place and quite crowded. It offers some of the most scenic views in Ibiza. It has several areas in which to enjoy the beach.",

          "Absolutely beautiful corner of the island. The sea in transparent and you can see lots of fish and other sea life. The restaurants and bars are expensive, therefore I would recommend taking own food and drinks if wanted to keep costs down. However when on the island it's a must",
          "The water is beautifully clean and the area lovely and clean. We took a water taxi here and spent the whole day here. It was absolutely beautiful. We sunbathed and read but mostly spent the time swimming. 100% would recommend if you love beautiful scenery and swimming.",

          "This cove has a good variety of spots to lie down, sun tan and swim in the sea. A beach chair service is offered. We loved the waves and the color of the water. The parking lot is big enough but you might want to go early to park easily. Enjoy!",
          "If you want to see an amazing sunset head to cala comte, there's a bar/restaurant there If you want to enjoy it with a bite to eat or a drink. Free parking with a small walk to the beach/viewing point. Worth an evenings visit!",

          "This is by far one of the best beaches in Ibiza and is well worth visiting. I fully suggest getting there by boat as you get to see a lot more scenery. The water taxi from San Antonio also stood at Cala Bassa. The water at Cala Comte is like something off an advert and the",
          "If your in Ibiza and want a sunset, ignore the over priced Mambo sitting on rocks, get a bus to Comte (you will need a taxi back) and just enjoy - what an amazing place and ever better for a beach too. Top tip, to eat go to the furthest restaurant of the 3, this is from where",
          "Lovely spot to snorkel if the wind isn't too strong and the jellyfish are not too prevalent. Lunch at the 'Sunset Ashram' is great but expensive.",
          "Mega chill out spot to watch the sun go down, we dove 1 hour to visit this ideal beach and it was well worth it. You\u2019d have to park off the site and walk to the beach which can be about 5 mins walk. When you get there it\u2019s just amazing, the people the view is amazing and the",
          "The beach was very beautiful with turquoise water and rocks and islands and boats in the sea. It was very busy though, and you are literally towel to a towel... the only credit I give is for the beautiful waters and views.",

          "The beach here is small and can get crowded but it is worth it. You can enjoy sangria served to you on the beach and you can rent an umbrella as well. You should bring cash for beach service. Stay here for the day and enjoy the sun and sea, then watch one of the most amazing",
          "Forget all the Cafe del Mar hype and go chill at Cala Comte.... either on the sandy beaches or on the rocks, dangling your feet in the azure Mediterranean sea. Take a picnic basket or be cool at one of the three restaurants there - each with a different style, be it hippy theme,",
          "Nice sandy beach, but way too crowded. Food/drinks heavily overpriced. A portion of quinoa with hardly any vegetables, herbes and pinenuts (contrary to the menu) for E22. Insane. E6 for a small bottle of beer (San Miguel). Been there, done that... will not return.",

          "This is absolutely the best beach: a part with sand, another with rocks. Bars and restaurants close by. The only pity is that there is not a real service with umbrellas and chairs and everywhere (specially on the sandy part) is invaded by people of every kind. It would be",

          "Snorkelling in this bay was easy for beginners and rewarding - lots of little fish to see in shallow, clear water. Beach itself was small and very crowded. Sunset Ashram cafe has reasonably priced food and drinks, good atmosphere and great view. There's free parking nearby.",

          "Now i know everyone is going to think that 3 star is harsh and don't get me wrong it is a wonderful place and beach. However, this is based on personal experience and advice for others and i personally think this is far too overcrowded and you can find the same quality of places",

          "Gorgeous crystal clear water, cleanish sand, rocky and dusty and extremely busy. Relatively easy to park, a little walk but worth it. There is s restaurant and a cafe, would advise booking for both. Worth a visit.",

          "We have never seen so many people squeezed into such a small space, which kind of spoilt it so, we made a hasty retreat! Guess a very early start is necessary if one is determined to enjoy the lovely beach. Far too crowded for us middle aged folk but possibly just the thing",

          "First time visit to this beach, and can not thing why we had not visited before, many sections incl a discreet nudist area, 3 choices of restaurants, some with Djs/ music and what looked like plenty of parking space, our October visit found the areas fairly spacious but still",

          "Oh my, I think this might be the most beautiful beach I've ever been to with regard to the natural scenery and crystal clear water. There were people of all ages enjoying this lovely place, but if you have children, be warned that many of the young women are topless.",
          "Nice sandy beach, clean water with great views. It has 2/3 separate bays two of which had quite a few jelly fish swimming about when we visited. Very popular at evenings with people coming to watch the sunset. Large parking area that gets filed easily. There are 3 Bar",
          "This is a really beautiful beach, it does get busy but you can usually find a little space to squeeze into. You will be rewarded with clear water and sandy beach.",

          "Lovely beach with a beautiful view. This was our favorite spot to go to. With the Sunsert Ashram @ the beach to make it complete. Food & drinks aren't cheap, but the vibes there are great. In the afternoon there's a DJ providing you with lovely music.",
          "A sunset visit should definitely be on the cards.! Go all day enjoy the sandy beaches, clear water. Rocky coves, amd shallow waters. There is a bar with some chillout music, shop, 2 restaurants. Possible to get by bus or go by car and park anywhere, loads of room. It is a",

          "Stayed in San Antonio bay and it rain on our last day so we took a bus from San Antonio to Ibiza old town. Only 2 euros on bus and well worth the trip. Absolutely lovely with plenty to do and see. Could put the day in just sitting in one of the harbour cafes just watching world",
          "Very beautiful beach, sand and water is lovely. Very very busy though. Go to the far restaurant from the main beach for some truly amazing food and great view whilst eating lunch.",
          "It's one of the best beaches on the whole island, in fact is also one of the most crowded during high season. Apart from that, is always a pleasure spending some time there. The only drawback is that there are just two restaurants that don't offer snacks or stuff like that.",
          "This cala is a great place to soak up the atmosphere and watch gorgeous sunsets. Crystal clear waters and only a small beach but it has a nice bohemian feel to it. We parked on the side of the road in the evening and walked down rather than try to find a parking space closer to",
          "We arrived on the bus which was a good ride and well-priced. Calla Comte does have some wonderful points, lovely beach areas with good swimming, great views. There are three restaurants/cafe/bar establishments so there is a choice. However, prices are at the top-end of our",
          "Having been to Cala Salada, Talamanca beach, Figueretas and Cala D'Hort, Cala Comte was certainly the best. Beautiful clean, fine sand and clear waters full of fish and perfect for snorkelling. Sunset was beautiful and having the Sunset Ashram bar there too for toilet and drinks",
          "Perfect for sunset but very busy during the day. I will only go back to enjoy the sunset again. Too many people on the sand, no place for everybody.",
          "I've visited many calas and beaches in Ibiza and this one is my favourite one. Crystal clear water, quite (beginning of September!!), lovely landscape. You have a nudist beach as well at the South side of the cala, a restaurant, chiringuitos, free parking, etc. I can't recommend",
          "Gorgeous beach, this is was the best beach for swimming in the sea that we found - very calm and loads of space in the water. The beach bar is nice, great food - quite pricey though as there's nowhere else to go! We went out-of-season and it was very busy - can imagine it gets",

          "Beautiful Location, water. It is not a secret beach like any other beach in Ibiza . Complete Disneyland !! too crowded. No place to park. People lying in a small area like in a sardine can. Think of the London tube with a view !",

          "Amazing waters. Sandy beach with unique scenery. Probably the best of the island. Unfortunately , it is very crowded. Nice beach bar with excellent cocktails but the food is very pricey. Not to be missed.",
          "For me this is the best Cala in Eivissa. The water is Cristal clear and the scenery is magic. The only thing I don't like is that a big area of the beach is taken by a private company renting boats and water motorcycles.",
          "Can't recommend this Beach enough- so different than much of the more commercialised Ibiza You can get s bus or taxi there. A couple of bar restaurants service the beach.",
          "Cala Comte is fantastic. The water is unbelievable, you can easily find a spot not fully surrounded by people even in August... that's the place I want to go back to!",
          "Beyond any doubts the best cala in Ibiza. My advice is to have a dinner in the last restaurant situated on the peak of the cala. Cheap prices and amazing quality.",
          "It was just way too crowded for comfort. We arrived early, around 10:00h or so. Rented sun beds and umbrellas from a completely stressed out beach boy (MAN). Enjoyed the tranquility of the place for about two hours or so, till the crowd streamed in... NON-STOP till we left",
          "Cala Comte is a beautifull place to go.you can choose between the big beach ans the small one where you can stay naked if you want. On the big beach there is a restaurant. Very crowded from both sand and water side but grat white water and great view on the island and on the",
          "In August the beach was very crowded. The \"cliff\" and the stones are somewhat cool looking. It's worth a short visit but not recommended for a whole day to spent there. Parking is free and relatively close by.",
          "This very unusual beach with cliffs, rocks, sand and beautiful views has to be the most visually stunning one in the whole Ibiza. Unfortunately everyone knows this and from noon onwards you're lucky to be able to find space to spread your towel. Come early and leave by noon.",
          "What a beautiful beach! Ibiza really surprised me with this beach, the sea is crystal clear with soft sand. The water wasn't cold, but refreshing. Even though it's an extremely busy beach the sea is still clean. Only a few sunbeds are available, bring some towels and an",

          "I would definitively recommend going here for a beach day. Water is so clear there! It's quite crowded, but manageable. Also for the gentlemen, there were a lot of monokini women, which was a plus ;) The few restaurants there were quite expensive and crowded, so I advise to",

          "We went on a weekday expecting to enjoy a great beach visit and restaurant experience. It was very busy and unpleasant and had a lack of shower facilities. Other than that the water is crystal clear and the views spectacular, definitely worth a visit.",

          "The most beautiful sunset on the Island. The view is just amazing with all the little island in front. The ashram bar is very lively with music and the little bar next to it called cala escondida is more quite and very authentic.",

          "Absolutely gorgeous place. We went out on a boat trip and spent an afternoon here, very hot but easy to dip into the sea. The beach bar was busy but we soon managed to get a seat after arriving. If you're thinking of doing a day trip here while you're in Ibiza I highly recommend",

          "We have been several times in Ibiza and have always had lunch 1 day at Cala Comte. There are several small Coves to pick for having a swim and at least 3 different restaurantes you can choose for Lunch. It is a bit crowded this time of year but I do recommend visiting this place",
          "Went to Cala Comte via aqua ferry bus which from San Antonio Bay is 30 mins and 10 Euros return. Lovely beach, choppy clear sea which was fun for teenage son. Some restaurants around but be careful they are expensive",

          "Beautiful beach with a lot to do, watersports and relaxing everything is here. This is one of the most beautiful beaches Ibiza offers and easy reachable. Of course it is better to go early in the morning when the other people are still sleeping.",
          "The sea is clear, with a wonderful view, is one of the most beautiful beaches in Ibiza. I love it! you must see.",
          "Lovely beach, but felt very out of place with young children. The beach was very busy, and consisted mainly of young couples or groups of guys/girls drinking and posing for selfies! Needless to say we didn't stay very long!",
          "The beach itself is very nice and beautiful, water is turquoise, calm and cristal clear. Be aware of the stinging jellyfish! Even when arriving at 11 the beach is packed it's hard to find a place to lay down. Close to the beach right were the water taxi arrives you can find a",

          "This is a must beach to be seen, however be ready to have a very small place to share with a lot of people. This beach is super warm and is usually covered from wind. The water is incredible, same as the price for the couple of restaurant around! \u20ac3.50 for a cornetto ice",
          "Love this beach but it's gone very commercial which is sad the beaches were rammed on a Friday we sat away the cross on the rocks and ate at the restaurant at the end which was very chilled and informal and not too bad in price be warned Cafe Ashram plays fabulous music but is",

          "This is a beautiful beach, the water is crystal clear. Very clean with stunning views. The two restaurants are quite expensive so would advise to bring food and drink. We hired two sunbeds and a parasol which cost 30 euros in total. So worth it though a wonderful day spent on",

          "Good beach for swimming, tanning, some water sports and snorkeling - the water is very clear. Sadly a few jellyfish this time around. The walks to the beach are good, wear decent shoes. Parking gets tight around mid day. Bus stop nearby. Restaurants good value with cold",
          "This place is beautiful and it's a must to see if you come in Ibiza. The best period to go is low season though, because during hight season you can find not even a little spot to put down your beach towel. The sunbeds here are very comfortable and they are not super expensive",
          "The beach is perfect. Clear water and white sands . The only thing that misses is the quality of the services. There is just one overpriced bar around the beach and a little bit overrated. However overall it was a great experience!",

          "It's a Super beach with the nice round bar, serving both sushi and tapas food, overlooking the sea. Nice spot for the sunset in a wild, natural atmosphere. If you're onto something more commercial and want to join a long crowd, you're quite close (by car) to San Antonio's bars",
          "Very beautiful beach, with cafe/restorant. It reminds me of Flinstones, the beach is sandy. Also there is big parking in front of cafe ;)",
          "I was there with my wife 3 days ago... it is not yet summertime but there was a lot of people. It was not croweded but I imagine what it can be found in July and August. The beaches and the sea deserve at least you spend a day there... I imagine that for diving and snorkeling",
          "We caught the bus from San Antonio bus station at a cost of \u20ac2.40 each way and arrived 30 minutes later and then a small walk of 100 meters we were at Cala Comte. Our first impression was that of delight what a lovely place, we then spent a wonderful 5 hours relaxation.",

          "I first came to Cala Comte about 15 years ago and it's definitely got more well-known by tourists in this time. However, it's still a much quieter, more scenic and generally more enjoyable place to watch the sun go down than Sunset Strip in San An. But then I think that applies",
          "We have been many times to Cala Comte. Only a few minutes drive from San Antonio it is quieter and the sea is incredible. Beware of rip tides though in this area. There are 3 restaurants to choose from, we usually pop into Sunset Ashram which has wonderful views but recently has",
          "I visited Cala Comte in April and it was perfect. I don't know how it is in high season, but the water is as clean as it can be and the view is just perfect. Beach bar in not the nicest one, and the prices are high but the view is amazing so it's worth to sit down and enjoy the",

          "Trust me when I say this is THE BEST BEACH in Ibiza. Might be crowed but waters blue NO SEAWEED!!! restaurants and washrooms close by. There's space you may have to shift around the beach its spreads out over a good size area small sacrifice for quality. Now there is a lovely",
          "You can get good food there, plenty of restaurants for all kind of budgets.... and one of the best views of the islands. We always go there, but if you want to get a place in the sand part you have to go there really early. If not you will end sitting on the rocks.....",
          "one of my favourite beach in ibiza, not so easy to access for elderly or wheelchairs, but sunsets there are just amazing, far left you will find cala comtita,an hidden treasure with a very little chiringito...paradaise..",
          "If you like extremely blue and clear water beaches with white sand and a couple of island to top it off, this is the beach to go! In the high season it tends to get very busy, but there is lots of space and parking, if you're not into crowded and busy places, and you don't mind",
          "So beautiful beach, there is a beach seats you can rent. In the high seasons the place so crowded of people.",
          "Beach and coastline create brilliant and fabulous atmosphere. Sand and rock along with a crystal clear sea, coves and islands make this landscape a place Photo Service for marriage. The walks along the coast, passing between a beach and the other is a Show.",
          "This place has some beautiful views. You have a peculiar nice beach, if the sea is calm and the tide is low. The downside is how much overcrowded this place was, it kind of ruins its potential for providing a great experience. You have a Restaurante just above it.",
          "You have everything you need there. Above the beach is a really nice restaurant/bar with nice chill out house music playing all day long. This sandy beach is really clean and the water is gorgeous. It's like from a movie scene. There are also a lot of free parking spots so you",

          "Very scenic beach, views are amazing and great place to watch the sunset. The beach itself is very small and will become overcrowded in peak months, if you have young children you're better off visiting Cala Bassa or Cala Tarida which are more family friendly. If traveling",
          "Was recommended this spot by jeep hire guy! Pulled up and looked amazing! Busy but super friendly atmosphere! The best sunset on the island!",
          "Cala Comte in my opinion is the best beach in Ibiza. The only downside is that gets very crouwded that sometimes you cannot put the towel. Apart from the sand, there's flat space on the cliff where you can also lie down and that makes the beach even more beatiful. The beach bar",
          "The place to go for dinner if you like sea food Centrally located at the harbour. Very friendly staff. Middle upper price segment but worthwhile to pay for.",
          "Oh my goodness! Having been to Cala Comte in the past, I was so keen to show to my 18yo son, I so wanted to have lunch in the 'Flinstone' restaurant, but on the day we went it was absolutely chocka, so we walked across to the restaurant on the beach, and what a choice we made!",
          "During high season not worthwile visiting due to crowded beaches without any private space. However nice music and bar (sunset ashram)",
          "We stopped off here as part of a boat trip. The water is amazing, crystal clear, but the beaches are tiny and the amount of people crammed on is silly. There's barely any place to lay a towel! We did do some nice snorkelling around the rocks and there were quite a lot of fish in",
          "Of all the beaches I have visited in Ibiza so far, this one has the most beautiful water. Located at the bottom of a cliff, at an exposed point, it has 2 beaches divided by a busy sand bar. If you are facing out unto the sea, I recommend the beach on the left hand side. The",

          "This beach is a wonderful spot, with superb views and clear water. It's busy during the main holiday season, but well worth a visit. The nearby restaurants are also excellent.",
          "Definitely the best Cala in Eivissa! But please, don't spread the secret! But of course this is no longer a secret. This is a must do at the island",
          "Definetely one of the best beaches in Ibiza; the beach is really tight so it's always busy but the sea is as clear as a swimming pool....there's also a good caf\u00e8/restaurant on the top with a relaxing chillout music. Here are some pics :)",

          "Best beach in the southwest part of Ibiza, especially if you like swimming. A large swimming area with a sand bar far from the shore which makes it fun to stay in the water. No jelly fish, because the beach is not a secluded cove but exposed to currents. Sandy bottom, clear",

          "While staying on Ibiza we hired a car and the guy in the hire place gave us a map and highlighted about a dozen places that he recommended we visit. I picked Cala Comte at random, stuck it into the satnav and off we went! On arrival, there was a heaving car park but we found a",

          "We travelled here very easily on the bus and arrived by 11:00 am. The beach area is very small so most people find a space on the side of the cliff which is OK but by 1:00 pm it is packed, it's like seals basking in the sun. People keep on arriving all the time the car park",
          "A small and beautiful beach 10-minute drive from Sant Anthony de Portomany that is best to visit at night for its gorgeous sunsets (possibility to eat there at the mythic Sunset Ashram). Far better than the Cafe del Mar for this purpose. There is a huge parking up the cliff.",

          "You better come early (high season) to enjoy the beach, was still quiet ~12:00 am, then forget it. The beach is so nice, water so transparent, that everyone come there and gets very crowded. The sand beach is also very small. But even so, you have to see that beach in Ibiza.",
          "This beach is awesome. Yes the beach area is small but that is what makes me like this location. It area makes everyone come together to have fun in the sun. The water is perfect and super clear and the scenery and rock formations make this area a true gem. We took a taxi",

          "We have visited Cala Comte for over 10 years and the location is stunning, however the addition of the words 'beach club' has made this a new 'Blackpool' with banana boats, jet skis etc. The natural Beauty of Cala Comte is now totally overshadowed",

          "Cala Conta is a very lovely beach, but I agree with others that it lacks amenities so you need to be prepared for that. It is a thin small beach, but worth the visit. Parking can become difficult at high season, so arrive early. Next to Cala Tarida this is a beach worth",

          "Well, what can I say. I'm sure it once was a cool place with good, hand made products. However, it is far away from that, nowadays. Mostly industrially produced stuff, be it textiles, pottery, jewellery... I saw products I have seen exactly like that in stores in shopping malls",
          "I enjoyed walking around the Hippy Market and found the atmosphere very friendly. If I had one criticism it would be that once you ask the price of something the stall sellers are desperate to get a deal from you and are determined to get you to buy it. I just walked away from",

          "For somewhere that is meant to have beliefs that it's existence was in some way there to help the planet it does the absolute opposite I felt that the stalls where so commercial very little has been handmade and all that seems to have been done is most of the items for sale have",

          "Had read a lot about the hippy market, loads of stalls lots of handcrafted items, nice relaxed atmosphere, arrived early so wasn\u2019t to busy, but I can image peak season it would get very hot with all the big crowds, really enjoyed it",

          "My hubby and I visited the hippy market a few days ago & really enjoyed it. We took the scenic water taxi from Santa Eulalia and them walked the ten minutes up to the market. The market is madly busy but really well organised with plenty of places to get a drink. There are",
          "We visited this on Wednesdays as it the day of the market it was a 30 min walk from our hotel - there\u2019s many sellers food and drink sellers and several singers. And bands - it\u2019s nice but busy to walk around and there are over 100 stalls so easily worth a morning visit",
          "We visited at the end of the season in September so it wasn't overly crowded but even so, extremely hot. There's a great vibe here albeit now a very commercial feel too. We found some truly fabulous stuff - including beautiful singing bowls - but there was also tons of landfill",
          "We went a little later as we read it can get very busy first thing. Loved the experience and got some really nice things at great prices. loved the love music and the atmosphere here. Definitely worth a look.",
          "Visited on Wednesday 14th Woodstock anniversary market is huge although a lot of stalls repeat. Great bar and music in the centre well worth the visit.",
          "Maybe it used to be a hippy market but it's not any more..some good handmade stalls but the rest is cheap junk you can buy anywhere. It doesn't have the charm it once had.",
          "There is absolutely nothinv \"Hippy\" about the place. The stalls are a mixture of utter tack and fake designer type things you can buy anywhere on the island for much cheaper than the market.. The market is seriously overcrowded and in such heat this is not just very stressful",
          "Hadn\u2019t heard about this before we arrived but worth a visit. Unlike most markets in that most of the items for sale were locally made and good quality. Doreen and Dave Northumberland",
          "We go to Ibiza a lot and always visit the Hippy Market, which is on every Wednesday in the season. It is a very busy place with lots of stalls, places to eat and have a drink. There is also a live music section where you can enjoy the Ibiza beat to your hearts content. I",
          "I visited last year on my own and raved about it to my husband so we returned this year with our 5 and 7 year old in tow. It was a mistake. Not at all suitable for kids. Very hot,crowded, not very much for them to see or do and just not somewhere I would ever take them again.",
          "Really enjoyed this market loads of stalls and plenty of variety music playing and few different places for drinks etc",
          "The market is a lot bigger than you think, some really lovely things there, friendly happy and good fun",
          "Was advised to go early when it was opening, opens at 10am we got there about 9.45 and it was already open, plenty of nik naks, clothes souvenirs, a wide choice of gifts to buy as presents, but be warned by lunch time early afternoon it gets very busy and hot",
          "It is very busy ,so avoid if yu do not like walking in the crowd..Many lovely items for sale but not cheap.Would not advice to go there with small kids.",
          "I\u2019ve been visiting the hippy market for the last 20 years and it used to be great..and I understand that it gets busy because it\u2019s a sight seeing tourist thing to do..but the stalls have changed,all sell more or less the same thing these days and everything is so expensive",
          "Large souvenir market, music, restaurants, etc. Crowded around noon on Wednesdays. Then visit the town of Es Ca\u00f1ar nextdoor.",
          "Busy open air pedestrianised market with a massive selection of artisans offering their wares. Definitely worth a visit. Car parking nearby with a \u20ac4 charge. Very busy and it gets a bit hot.",
          "We spent one morning at the Hippy Market and loved the variety of goods at the market, there was something for everyone got a lot of little novelty gifts",
          "Annoyed that all of this was going on in our hotel complex. The so called Hippy Market is enormous, loads of repetitive stalls selling the same sort of thing. Very busy and hot. It was frustrating to have to walk through all of this maddens to get to our hotel room, or to the",
          "Been many times, this time we went early when it was cooler which was a good idea. It was well organised and lots of stalls were present for a casual browse.",
          "On every Wednesday just outside Es Canar. Walking distance up the road. Very very busy place for a Look around loads of different items and stalls. Location is sheltered in the trees and provides refreshments and other foods to try. Local Souvenirs and items . OK for a visit",
          "It was very busy here when we visited at 10.30am and very hot but there was a lot of shade whilst walking around. Great market with lots to see and buy. A definite must to visit if holidaying in Es Cana.",
          "We visited here as a family of four. This market is not the classic bargain market. Items were very expensive. It's based in a wooded area, that's very pretty but extremely hot a sweaty. The market is over crowded and over priced. A huge disappointment.",
          "We had a great day out here , there is so much to do. Thankfully lots of it is under shelter ( although still very hot ) you can shelter in the tent as well where there is live music. A lot of the stalls are repetitive but you expect that here, it\u2019s got a really good atmosphere",
          "It's been quite a few year's since my last Hippy Market visit,this time on my own,without family in tow. I was there for a reason though,as I'd arranged to meet up with a bag seller,who I'd met a few nights earlier in Santa Euliara,he'd given me a rough idea of where abouts in",
          "Really big market with all kinds of stuff but also food and toilet facilities. Parking is easy and costs 4 euro a day",
          "Not authenticate in any way. Stalls playing hip hop and not psychodelic music. Crowded and had a funny smell about it. Sold nothing but that.",
          "The hippy market is well worth a visit. However, after looking at the first few stalls you\u2019ll notice that everything starts to look the same. It is also extremely crowded add that to the heat and it can make it an uncomfortable experience for some.",
          "The appearance of the stuff sold here is very hippy style, but they understood hiw to trick the tourists, so the prices may be higher than the ones in other small stores on the island. Keep tour eyes open!",
          "Lasted about 20 minutes here and that\u2019s only because I got lost around it. All you had to do was poke your nose in the first few stalls and you would have seen the whole market. Everything was the same, same products. Wouldn\u2019t go again.",
          "We arrived at 12pm. Extremely busy which made it difficult to navigate! The stalls are much the same. The live music in the bar was very good. My advice would be get there for 10am.",
          "This market is a must, this market is massive with some fantastic artifacts, a lot of hand crafted gifts, loads of jewelry and lots of clothes.",
          "Glad we went but found everything pricey V v v hot and glad we didn\u2019t travel far to get to it Not sure we would go again",
          "We visited the market on a wednesday and arrived at 10 to beat the crowds. There was lots to see but mainly the bits you can get in the shops but just priced higher. There was lots of handmade bits though which I love. There was a kids area and for \u20ac5 you can make a dream",
          "The market itself is lovely, really big, loads to see! There's entertainment and food stalls, the clothes stalls are lovely, and there's bargain bins with some great deals. There are card machines at some stalls but DON'T USE THEM! I wanted to buy a leather bag but ran out of",
          "This was my first time visiting the markets and was lucky enough to go with friends that had been many times before. We got the 9am bus from Santa Eulalia into Es Cana and walked the short distance to the market. Would recommend an early start before it is too busy and hot.",
          "We went in the middle of the day. We had a car and it was easy to park as there were many makeshift car lots. There was lots of choice and many original crafts. I am not sure it be suitable for very young children as it was extremely busy. Worth a look.",
          "Even if it is very crowded, the experience lived here is a very interesting one, those who sell here are really genuine hippies, in short the things they sell are handmade and are of good quality.",
          "Was OK but in the middle of the hotel was a joke.. We came out and the hotel had turned in to a market and we had to walk past everyone just to get to the pool or back to our room",
          "Remarkable place, massive number of stalls and really well organised. Lots of flowing dresses, leather goods, artwork and the like. Live music in the main drinks tent from lunchtime. Incredibly hot so be worth going earlier and bear in mind finding a taxi back will be almost",
          "If it\u2019s hotter then 30 degrees don\u2019t go cause you can\u2019t breathe!! It is worth a visit because there are loads of stalls etc.",
          "Oh I loved visiting here! All unusual vibrant different stalls. Happy people on the stalls. Only downside was caught bus from San Antonio for dya trip but bus stop in Es Cana good way from market and market is all uphill!!",
          "Does what it says on the packet. A pretend throwback to the 60s. Most goods made outside of Europe. That said worth the trip.",
          "The market is a 10 minute walk from Es Cana alternatively if you drive there are a number of car parks that charge \u20ac4. The market itself is extremely popular to the point that it is impossible to look at many of the stalls as you get pushed along by the crowds. Most of the",
          "Swamped with mass produced items that you can buy anywhere at over inflated prices. Some genuine craft and unique goods but unable to appreciate and admire these due to shuffling round like a colony of overheated penguins. Cold drinks extortionate per can. Cramped aisles and",
          "The Hippy Market was in the grounds of our Hotel complex every Wednesday. What a lovely experience. Yes it was busy and a little harder to get around than on the other 6 days of the week but it was worth the upheaval. The stalls were packed and the place was buzzing. Our 5",
          "We visited the Hippy Market 17 years ago and loved it then and we still love it. Loads of different items for sale. Ideal for keepsakes and presents to take home. Our daughter had a caricature done the last time we were there aged eleven. She had another one with her husband",
          "Gosh it gets hot here but its smaller than the other one so doesn't take quite as long to sweat round! There is parking (extra charge) and there is shade there but it does get very busy and hot. It does run Monday & Tuesday in the evenings which may be a lot cooler, we didnt",
          "Fantastic market and was overcast the day we visited - so ideal for browsing. Very different to usual markets as was very diverse with lots of good quality souvenirs and goods to buy. Not to be missed if staying nearby - go early to avoid crowds.",
          "Plenty of character and music you will always end up buying something, only negative is the crowds at this can be overwhelming and can feel clostraphobic in the heat but don't let that put you off ,worth the visit.",
          "A fabulous morning spent at the Hippy Market. It was very busy due to it being an unusually cloudy day. Would visit again.",
          "Arrived at 10 for opening. Really fab interesting stalls. Some very expensive, but plenty unique bargains to be found. By 1130 really busy so arrive early if you don't like shuffly walks through the crowds.",
          "Came here last Wednesday afternoon (although would recommend going in the morning when it\u2019s abit cooler). It\u2019s quite vast in size all sorts of different stalls the favourite parts for me was the DJs in the middle and the odd street performer dotted about. Great for all ages.",
          "Expect big crowds and a chilled out atmosphere here. There are lots of stalls selling various items ranging from jewellery and handbags to rugs and homeware. It gets very, very busy though so if you have children, keep them close.",
          "Very busy place Full of stalls selling hippy stuff every Wednesday.myself wasn't interested in buying anything but had to visit as I was staying nearby You gotta visit if you are near",
          "We just loved this place and had so much fun there browsing, eating and listening to some great music while eating some great food. Amazing art and clothing etc. Will take you a few hours to see. Open on Wednesday only so don't miss it. \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Beware it can get very busy and very warm! But it\u2019s a must visit, and I spent more than expected on jewellery and gifts. Couldn\u2019t help myself! Some good live music too. Defo worth visiting!",
          "We went to the market as a family of five ranging from 15 to 81 years and all found something that we liked about the market. Yes it was hot and very busy and this was at 10am however a lot of the walkways are covered up meaning that you\u2019re not in direct sunlight. Plenty",
          "Cool market. Very busy very hot. Lots of arts, crafts and jewellery. Little pit stops here and there. Not the best with a buggy but we managed. The area is nice and we found a nice restaurant after the market down near the sea. Worth a little visit",
          "Don\u2019t go there. My son like the mojitos. But that\u2019s it. Awful shops. Non spanish. They just want to rip you off",
          "We love visiting the hippy market when we visit es cana. There are lots of stalls, performances, food and drink stalls and music. Stalls include- jewellery, clothing, woodwork, CDs, toys and lots more! Its advisable to go earlier on before all of the coaches arrive. The market",
          "Great market experience which is on a Wednesday each week. Wonderful stalls with many unusual items and also bars and food points. Also try the nearly Los Dallias Hippy Market on a Saturday",
          "It\u2019s a good plan to get there early- arrived at 10.15 left at 11am and it was getting really hot and busy. Usual stuff on offer - a few artisan stalls but mostly goods on offer were available in the tat shops around the island.",
          "Spent a good 3 hours browsing and buying down really interesting stuff. Plenty big with lots of variety and good parking close by. Go outside the heat of the day peak hours as hot hot hot. But worth a visit if into markets",
          "A nice place to stop and take a look around. There are many stalls that sell a variety of items, from jewellery to clothes, to paintings, to furniture. There are a wide selection of items all in the \"Ibiza hippy\" way. The items there are rather expensive however and it can get",
          "Great fun but lots of repetition and overpriced stuff the same as in shops in Es Cana. Go early as it gets very busy and hot and watch your bag/pockets.",
          "Just off the main road in Es Cana. Lots and lots of stalls selling clothes, jewellery, toys, accessories and items for the home. Eating areas and singers and dancers performing. Very hot walking around so take some water and a fan! Would of loved to stay longer but got too",
          "Before we went to this market I\u2019d read reviews here that said it gets crazy busy. We arrived at around 1130 and it was busy but not unpleasant. We wandered around, had food and drinks, did some shopping, and didn\u2019t leave until 6.30pm! Some of the stalls repeat what other sell,",
          "Save your money and the crowds, packed and very commercial. Not how it was! Try las dalias instead, proper hippies",
          "I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates artistic talent and bargains. The leather especially is exceptional.",
          "We were staying in Cala llonga, just up the coast, a 45 min ferry boat ride away, 18 euro return trip, pretty and well worth it! Arrived at market which is a ten minute, flat walk from the boat mooring, at about 10.30. Lots of stalls selling clothes, trinkets, paintings,",
          "I have fond memories of the market as a child and it\u2019s still great but very expensive to buy goods. Shame as it makes you feel a bit ripped off. Worth a visit though",
          "And I mean crowds. If you are any way claustrophobic or dislike crowds then keep away as the place is packed. However my wife loves shopping and markets and she lived it, my ranking reflects my ambivalence to shopping.",
          "I loved the Hippy market as did my 11 year old, my husband and 13 not so much. There were so many amazing hand made staffs which were great to see. Not too expensive for the hand made items. Occasional stall with some fake goods but thankfully these were few and far between to",
          "This used to be a cool spot. Its now full of stalls selling overpriced stuff, some of it really nice but ridiculously expensive. I spent a few hours there this week and didnt see one transaction take place. There seems to be a reluctance to haggle too....all very un-Hippy!",
          "Everything you would expect, the range of products available and at the price was exceptional. If you\u2019re in the area I\u2019d highly recommend the visit.",
          "We travelled by bus no19 from San Antonio bus station very reasonable 8.90 euros for both of us one way the journey takes about 45 mins and is very busy. On arrival in Escana bus depot there are a few signs for the market which is about a 10 minute uphill walk. We were",
          "Expect busy but hassle free browsing around the stalls of the hippy market on Wednesdays in Es Canar. It\u2019s a must for those who haven\u2019t been before, be entertained by various musicians, bands trance drums etc and wowed by the displays of the many stalls here selling some unusual",
          "Crowded but enjoyable . Got lots of interesting stuff and Es Cana is nice.there is perking beside market . But buggies and wheel chairs are have limited access.",
          "Punta Arabia\u2019s the largest Hippy Market on Ibiza! Simply a must see when you visit the island. Although it is quite large, it still feels very cosy. Small stands, very nice people and enough spots to have a seat and eat or drink something. There you can take break and get some",
          "All the literature about Ibiza and Es Canar, but only half once a week, on Wednesdays. It is an easy walk from the centre of Es Canar, and there is plenty of (chargeable) parking adjacent to the site. How much of the merchandise is locally produced is probably debatable, but",
          "Plenty of stalls to see, selling mostly things to wear, clothes, bracelets, earrings etc and bits of different craft things. Can get a drink and some chilled fruits. Not enough toilets. Plenty of car parking spaces at $4. Easy to walk from Es Canar, and bus station not too far",
          "I have been here several times over about 10 years now and the prices have creeped up and up to the point where now it\u2019s amazing that you can go to a \u2018market\u2019 and spend 100 euros on one item easily. It\u2019s so overcrowded and a complete maze however seeing all of it is wasting",
          "been once never again. overpriced items which are alot cheaper in the shops. very crowded and hot. needs a one way system as you cant get near some of the stalls and lots of buggies which isn't ideal in a small space. most stalls aren't set up for when it opens at 10am. only a",
          "This place is an experience you must have when you come to Ibiza. Amazing atmosphere and great bargains. Easy to get too and lots of parking or you can get a bus.",
          "I wandered up to the Hippy Market on my own & had a lovely couple of hours wandering through all the market stalls. There were some genuine crafts people & artists which was nice to see.",
          "We arrived on a Wednesday and left on a Wednesday so didn\u2019t have much time at the hippy market but knew that we really wanted to visit and it didn\u2019t disappoint! Live music, food & drink and a great atmosphere! We couldn\u2019t believe the size of the market, we kept walking around",
          "What a load of touristic rubbish! No authenticity here at all. There is more tat than actual natural wears. I was disappointed. It took me ages to find a good and professional stall which sold genuine crystal jewellery. No natural stalls for oils etc. Some nice clothing stalls",
          "I visited here in June. I decided to go on my own, leaving my husband and little one at the hotel. This was a good idea aa its such a big market and on a hot day they qouls not have enjoyed it. Me on the other hand loved it. There were so many stalls to look round. Some of them",
          "Great market with lots of stalls and great buys. Advice look around as some places are more expensive than others. But a great day. Tip if staying in Es Canar don't buy the trip from hotel its only a 10 min walk from centre.",
          "Go people, have a lovely sunny day in Hippy Market some great stuff to buy and join in the sing song in people's tent- a reminder of hope and happier times !! The people here are lovely !!",
          "Lots of stalls and little bars about it's a nice day out the bar in the main tent is great sling some real ales . Also a DJ played hippy dance vibes .we really enjoyed it",
          "It\u2019s well worth a visit even if you don\u2019t plan to buy anything, just go early to avoid the crowds and heat. There were some lovely authentic products for sale but equally there was stuff that you could buy anywhere else. Go with an open mind and some cash! I wouldn\u2019t recommend",
          "20 minute walk from our hotel, go early as it gets very busy. Nice experience, lots of clothing, leather and jewellery",
          "We went to the hippy market on a Wednesday and had a fabulous day out and saw all the different tables of jewellery and crafts amazing day out",
          "Loved a walk round this market. We got there just as it openef st 10am. Most stalls up and running but some still setting up. This is the ideal time to browse the vast amount of stalls as any later and the place is packed. A lot of the stalls sell much the same things but get",
          "Lovely and large market that was beyond my expectations .. live music... places to eat and drink... eclectic mix of things to keep everyone interested",
          "Very busy. Multitude of stalls selling the same stuff. Hilly. Been once but definitely won't be back. Vastly overrated in my opinion.",
          "I have just visited today with my sister and had an amazing time wandering around the stalls. We are staying very close to the market in Es Cana so it was an easy 10 minute walk from our hotel at Alua Soul, it also meant we got to the market early. We go there around 9:30 and it",
          "we arrived early at the market has we were warned it gets very busy, they were not wrong, it was a very confusing place, once in it was very difficult to find the exit, the stalls were very much the same a lot of very expensive hand made craft ware (allegedly) not a place that",
          "First time in Ibiza and staying in Santa Eulalia, took the ferry up to Es Canar. The walk from the harbour was fine. Looks like theres plenty of parking if you're coming by car. The market is a hotch potch of hippy clothes and craft ideas. Most seems great on holiday in the sun,",
          "Went therr my son was not impressed so advise dont take the hubby shop alone very busy dont think i would visit again",
          "A huge choice of clothes, gifts etc. If you like Hippy Culture you would be spoilt. Lots of bright colours. A really different trip.",
          "The market was extremely busy as ever but we go every year. I enjoy looking around the different stalls and often buy pretty jewelry and crafts.",
          "Really cool place with plenty to see. We visited on a Wednesday, around morning time and it was very busy. Really creative place with cool vibes and really nice friendly people.",
          "We fancied a wee day away from our sunloungers to see a little bit more of Ibiza . The market is on a Wednesday and this fitted with our plans . We got the ferry which was located opposite our hotel and departed at 9am . The journey didn\u2019t take to long . The market is located a",
          "The hippie market was great enjoyed it very much great atmosphere . Lots of lovely things for sale & different artists playing unusual instruments",
          "Very huge hippie market with a lot of stuff. Some price are high but overall it's do-able. Good parking.",
          "I don't see the fascination with this market. We got here around 10.30am and it was already rammed, in 22degree heat it's not fun trying to manoeuvre 2 kids through so many people, you could hardly move. More over there is nothing actually here that most people would want to",
          "We spent an afternoon here. It\u2019s ok.. joss sticks, crafts and music. Very busy and most of the stuff is overpriced and aimed at tourists.",
          "Huge market selling overpriced bits and pieces - jewellery, tie-dyed t-shirts and the like. Absolutely heaving with tourists - many of whom arrive on huge coaches as part of organised tours. Not sure I would recommend.",
          "Have visited the market several times over the past years and seems to have become more of a general market. It's still worth a visit but has lost its way from the beginnings of years ago.",
          "Great hippy vibe and really nice clothes not tacky. Very easy to get lost in all the stalls as so many. Very easy to walk to from es Cana. Market is on Wednesday morning and afternoon and it\u2019s very busy.",
          "We got there at 10 when it opens but I think the whole island was there by 11! Lots of colourful stalls though and had a lovely morning wandering but be prepared for crowds, expensive prices and absolutely no haggling \ud83c\udf1e even in May was grateful that sheeting across the stalls",
          "We walked along from Cala Pada beach and it only took 20 mins. A pleasant walk and the hippy market is a must see! Yes it's busy but we just stayed for an hour and a half looking around the stalls, yes you might have to shuffle rather than walk in the crowded areas! But it's an",
          "we walked to the market from es cana harbour front.it took about 20 mins,mainly because the crowd moved slowly.the scent of aromatic herbs was everywhere.the goods sold in the market reminded me of the flower people .lots of floaty clothes, bracelets and beads.i loved the",
          "Heard so much about the market and there are lots of stalls with different things for sale. Worth a visit if you like markets",
          "Taking in the sounds, atmosphere looking for presents. Market changes little over the years. Visit early as it gets very hot and busy after midday when the coaches arrive. Prices are similar to local shops for clothes, but lots of various jewellery available.",
          "We got the bus here and it was really easy to navigate. We ended up going early to the Market based on reviews, had a walk around, went to a tent and had very strong 5e mojitos. Band started at 2pm, would recommend to go to the market at lunch time as it died down and wasn't as",
          "I always go to the hippy market when I\u2019m in Ibiza and I absolutely love it. Beware of pickpockets and the prices are generally higher than the local shops but it is a great experience",
          "Myself and a friend visited this market whilst on our holiday in es canar. Only a ten minute walk for us to get there. The atmosphere was great with lots of places to get food and have a sit down and listen to music. The stalls had beautiful items. All at very good prices. We",
          "Staying in Es Cana had to visit the hippy market. So busy and difficult to make your way around in some parts. Lots of stalls selling home made items and pkenty of food choices. There is a kid's area to allow children to dress up, make craft items etc. Worth a visit but couldn't",
          "A must if you are in Escanar the hippy market is very busy and very big With lots of fabulous jewellery clothes bags and shoes of all different varieties and wonderful colours you can grab yourself some food or a drink a must visit if you\u2019re in the local area",

          "There was a large number of stalls however the items on sale you can find anywhere on the island in souvenir stores. It was ok, whiled away the time but found most items I thought were overpriced.",
          "Worth a trip, but well worth arriving at 3pm as it\u2019s absolutely rammed in the middle of the day and you can\u2019t even really look at anything. Also worth doing a bit of shopping in Es Canar first as you can find some of the same things there for cheaper. The lemongrass solid",
          "As we were staying in Es Canar we went straight from breakfast which was the right thing to do.The four ladies really enjoyed it, it's true a lot of things are rubbish or repeated stall after stall but there are unique stalls as well selling one off things. By 10.30 it was",
          "Get there early 10am when it opens Lots off stalls and places to eat and drink .under cover too witch helps when it's a hot day",
          "Very busy don\u2019t take big bag ... stalls have something for everyone . Nice music and food Good to see been and done it .",
          "Great place, lots of Stalls selling great clothes everything reasonably priced. Very busy lots of people. Glad we went and had a look.",
          "disappointed with trip here. we came last year and was disappointed then so dont really know why we went back.just for somewhere to go i think.not what we expected.most of what is sold is also sold in the local shops at cheaper prices.dont get me wrong some things were nice but",
          "It\u2019s a really nice experience if you don\u2019t have kids. The market although vibrant and full of life doesn\u2019t really cater well for pushchairs and young families. We were told by a few stall holders to move on because our buggy was almost near their stall but with no where to go it",
          "We came across this market whilst walking past Omg it\u2019s brilliant wacky and well worth a visit loads of stalls with jewellery clothes bags beers food music Brilliant place Not to be missed",
          "Sent sometime walking around the hippy market to , there where hundreds of stools and plenty of things to buy. Well worth going.",
          "It was the first one of the season, so as expected it was really busy from lunchtime onwards. The size appears to have grown since our last visit two years ago and the variety and quality of the goods is excellent. It can be \u201cchallenging\u201d in places with a pushchair and don\u2019t",
          "Good for a walk around. Good atmosphere with lots of stalls but many items for sale are repeated. Well worth a trip to experience.",
          "Went with my youngest daughter (36) she thoroughly enjoyed it. Got some nice bargains but because it was early in the season not the whole market was there Didn't spoil it though. Worth going",
          "Went on a boat to this market and really enjoyed it .It was well run and set in a lovely setting .The stalls were typical market stalls but had some cool stuff to buy .Didnt get any food but it looked nice .",
          "I loved the market! It is good to look for the real local products, but it is a great experience! Strongly recommend.",
          "Huge market with lots to offer and lots of tat sadly. Didn't really find anything cheap or any bargains but worth the experience",
          "Nice market but even in april very busy. We parked a little bit outside at the beach restaurant and they charge 5 euro instead of the closer parking 4 euro. Market itself is nice, nothing special but ok to do while on holiday. There is security, didn\u2019t feel unsafe and lots of",
          "We found the hippy market to be quite fake and didn\u2019t feel it was very authentic. I lot of the stalls sold the same things over and over and all the things were for sale in the towns around Ibiza too. The paella was great though and we had some beers whilst listening to live",
          "Visited the market with a 10 and 13 year old. Lots of stalls but many offering the same items. Taxi rank outside for your return journey",
          "There's actually only 10 stalls in this market full of tat. These 10 are then repeated around 50 times. Row after row of same old stuff. Dresses that look like dish rags, mangy dreamcatchers, endless tshirts with tired old cannabis leaves or Bob Marley. It's a pickpockets",
          "What a lovely market Many different things to see plenty of food out let\u2019s Beautiful lace and hand made items",
          "It was a nice morning out from a what was a holiday in a very small quiet area of ibiza. So I welcomed the experience, along with hundreds of other people. If your not very patient like me it can ruin the experience. But nice stalls, the usual kind of things there, lot of",
          "Was a fab day lots of colourful stalls music and different cultures it was very hot though because it was so packed so make sure u drink plenty of water",
          "The hippy market was a short walk from Es Cana where we were staying. I was absolutely amazed at how busy it was given that it was the very first week of the season and the resort was still very quiet. It was impossible to walk anywhere quickly but that added to the",
          "Ok but didn\u2019t see much that you couldn\u2019t get on any market anywhere in the world. Atmosphere was nice though and toilet on site was clean. If you\u2019re into shopping for useless junk that you don\u2019t need you\u2019ll probably love this place.",
          "The so-called hippy market is more of a tourist trap, but there are still a few hippies around. All the stalls seem to be selling merchandise from the same Chinese factory so I would not recommend buying anything. However, we saw a brilliant performance by Ras Smaila & Serial",
          "We went to today to go to this much talked about \"Flea Market\" which was non-existent. We arrived in Ibiza (Cala Codolar) on 11/10/18 to stay for a week and one of the things we read about was this market as well as a few others. Since we knowing choose to come here on the",
          "Nothing special same as any tourist market...boring Very packed and very hot when we were there. Beware of pickpockets",
          "I have previously reviewed the Hippy Market after a visit in 2016. Previous experience wasn\u2019t the best, but Cala Llonga in October is quiet and we thought we\u2019d give it another visit and buy an updated caricature of our youngest son. This visit we knew what to expect and",
          "This is a place you\u2019ll either love or hate, for us we walked in and walked out, same stalls of the same stuff, very busy, rude people barging into you, people stopping straight in front of you, not a place for me I have to say!",
          "This place is a defiantly a worthwhile visit , we caught a bus to Ed canar, which cost less than 5\u20ac for 3 of us . Such a lovely vibe . Very unusual and unique stalls. My children loved it. Unfortunately a big delay on bus getting back a 45 minute delay , but as it was a rare",
          "Nice market with a good selection of products on sale. Still has its hippy roots but much broader in what it is selling now. Nice places to eat, great setting and a friendly vibe. It does get very busy and can be squashed in places so we dipped in and out a couple of times with",
          "A certain call for a Saturday on Ibiza. A good sized market with a range of wares. Perhaps less hippyish than in years gone by but well worth a visit, ps I had a good time but didn\u2019t buy anything!",
          "It was like stepping back to the 1960 s there was lots of different stalls and was a very good day out our granddaughter who is only 4 loved it to",
          "Ok so it was on the site of our Hotel and less the 50 ft from our front door. We all had a fantastic time. Home made goods with home made food . We all had a great time . It\u2019s extremely busy but as long as you go with the flow you will be fine",
          "Both my daughter and I loved the hippie market! Lots of quirky little stalls and the acoustic live set was amazing. A lovely way to spend a sunny afternoon, I would definitely return!",
          "Lots of different stalls selling all kinds of things. Nice to wander though it was very busy. Lots of jewellery and clothes.",
          "Well worth a visit when on holiday to Ibiza, the Hippy Market is bustling and friendly. It is quite large with lots of stalls, however many sell the same kind of things - leather bags and bracelets, t shirts and trinkets. Some are unusual and different but many things are mass",
          "Girls...If you love shopping, bargains, quirky hand made crafts & unusual funky outfits then this is definitely the place for you! Boys.. probably best to have a beer or two in the port & take the short walk to meet the girls there later! Saying that, there is lots of funky gear",
          "We stayed at the hotel where the market is held in it's grounds every Wednesday, the market is worth a visit but hasn't changed over the years but it is worth a walk round.",
          "we visited on October and I think by the amount of buses there the whole island had been bussed in! really crowded walkways and just gets a bit too much. Within the hippy market you find 80% same as what's in surrounding shops but for more than double the price! Nice to see but",
          "Was absolutely heaving, so would hate to go in high season. To be honest I found it very expensive for what there was. Don't get me wrong I'd did buy some nice bits but a lot of the merchandise is the same on a lot of stalls so shop around as prices vary quite a bit. Yeah was",
          "About a 20 min walk from our hotel, very busy and colourful, loads of stalls, quite a few stalls selling hand made stuff that the stall owners made which was nice, a lot of stalls selling same stuff as the local shops but at heavily inflated prices so we didn\u2019t buy much, worth a",
          "Set in the grounds of a hotel, there is well over a couple of hundred stalls. You will get the usual tourist bits and pieces along with some unique crafts. Buses and tours are arranged from all over the island but 5he 18 A stops right outside. Yes it is busy and people move",
          "Very disappointed, moor like a craft market lot of the same things, handmade jewellery, a bit off leather, very expensive,one good thing it is free to get in.",
          "Massive Market, expensive prices, lots of stalls, mostly selling same products. Open from I think 11 - 7, we went at around 12, packed in, no where to walk, hard to get to stalls. We went and had a drink then went back at around 2, loads better to walk around and view",
          "I have not been to Ibiza for 20 years but visiting the Hippy market was a must. I was somewhat disappointed as everything was so expensive. Not what you go to a market for",
          "Thought this would be something different from the usual mass markets on Spanish and Canarian Islands...\u2026\u2026. it was in that there seemed to be even less choice. Really after 10 stands you can stop browsing as the rest are pretty much the same, over 400 of them! Very little truly",
          "I visited the market twice this year & to be honest I really didn't enjoy it. There is some nice stalls, but most is tack you can buy on WISH. Not for somebody who really don't like crowds.",
          "Seriously over rated and over priced! We travelled a long way from the city centre to the famous Wednesday hippy market in Es Canary, expecting to see lots of handcrafted stuff and experience Spanish hippy culture. Were thoroughly disappointed, as almost all stalls were selling",
          "Visited by most people who come to Ibiza at some time or another, this trinket market is ideal for those take home gifts for the family. It does have a tendancy to get full of moving people through the market ways, which are narrow in places. Refreshments and entertainment is",
          "Spent a pleasant morning browsing the numerous stalls of this busy market. Not a lot of bargains to be had though, most items were fairly pricey and some we're poor quality. There were some interesting recycled sneakers and clothing which you can't buy on the High Street. Also",
          "Recently when to es Canar And was told to go to the hippy market,every Wednesday it\u2019s very good,it\u2019s massive and takes ages to walk around every stall but very busy and enjoyable,good prices with lots going on",
          "Full of hippy people.not our thing . The items sold were not our taste. We were told it was a market, but the the sort we would go to.",
          "The hippy market was amazing, so many stalls and amazing clothes, I bought some handmade hair clips for my granddaughter, it was very very busy but everyone was polite and let each other pass, there was a lovely little cafe for coffee and cold drinks",
          "Not the type of place to go if you have young children with buggys. Free cannabis air if you want it",
          "I like a market and this one was different to the tacky ones I have been to in Tenerife. It does get very busy and can be a bit samey. I got a lovely leather bag and some handmade jewellery. Didn't try bartering and it wasn't overly cheap but still enjoyable.",
          "Wasnt impressed really. Found better gifts and trinkets in the local shops. Absolutely packed and I can't be bothered with that.",
          "Travelled to Es Cana on the land train and arrived around 11am. The place was absolutely rammed with people and you couldn't get near the best stalls. Leather goods looked great but very expensive. Moving around the hilly site was difficult, particularly for young couples with",
          "It's a tourist trap, don't go. Seriously, don't. Way to busy. Market stalls are ok but not special. Food is awfull and overpriced. There are better things to do in Ibiza. So do yourself a favour and don't go.",
          "great place to visit i found a lot of the stalls to be expensive but the quality and quantity of goods is amazing well worth a visit.",
          "Thankfully our hotel was close by & offered a free shuttle, although it did leave us for 3 hours. Once you had manoeuvred your way around the quite \u2018samey\u2019 stalls, you\u2019re left with over an hour to kill. We had something to eat in the quite pricey restaurant, but admit that what",
          "Went to the hippy market with our friends delighted as usual with the great range of stalls the market was packed so difficult to browse some of the stalls. Ended our tour with a beer and a sit down much needed great place a must visit",
          "Very busy, we arrived at 10 and by 11 it was a challenge to get round. This only added to the enjoyment. You can get lots of unusual items. Very enjoyable.",
          "How many stalls can you possibly get in one place that sell exactly the same as the stall next to it with maybe the slightest variation. This for me is an experience that you can get round in 10 minutes, and being honest you have most probably spent five minutes to long there!",
          "We visited here on the day before out last day. It was hot, humid with some intermittent, short showers. This place is packed! I was holidaying with friends and there's no way I'd take my kiddies here. Too busy and crowded with little places to stop and sit. My mission was",
          "We decided to take a trip to the market on a cloudy day when the weather wasn't suitable for the beach. The market was something that we were recommended to visit before heading to Ibiza, so we decided to book the visit through an excursion company. We had no trouble getting",
          "Nothing particularly hippy about this place, other than a few random stalls and a few people with dreads. It was pretty busy but no-one seemed to be buying anything, and most stalls were selling the same items. Most interesting thing we saw was a hippy meditating with a bowl for",
          "We landed in Ibiza around 12.30 Was at the market 1.30 Love the atmosphere Lots to look at and eat. It did rain a little but its covered over so does not spoil the visit. Lovely stall holders who are very helpfull. Everyone should pay a visit while you are On holiday.",
          "We visited the Hippy Mrket, but we were very disappointed: a lot of profesional sellers with goods \" made in China\" that had nothing to do with Ibiza or Hippies. Only 4 local craftsmen on the whole market that produced their own goods while you are talking to them. We bought",
          "Extremely busy stall after stall of the same jewellery, bags, glasses, jewellery, bags, glasses. Lots of places to eat and drink. Quite a trek from the bus drop off, not somewhere you want to go on a stifling day really.",
          "Busy Busy place sadly all stalls sell same type of products and a bit pricey clothing is of the hippy style not everyone's choice .",
          "Same 5 stalls over and over. Unless you really want some hand made jewellery, it may not be. We went early to avoid the crowds and still spent a very long half-hour trying to find the exit through the sea of push-chairs.",
          "Wanted to visit her our of curiosity. A little walk from the bus station and got busy early on. Very interesting and was pleased with the quality of stalls. A lot of handmade items, better than I expected. Felt safe here and a very pleasant experience.",
          "Incredibly popular as you would expect. It literally heaves with people attempting to view and browse the tiny market type stalls. There's some street type entertainers around and the sound of drums. Don't be fooled by some of the timings sold though, choose wisely and be aware",
          "One of the big tourist draws on the island and to be fair, its a large pretty well organised event with stalls that stay true to arts and crafts (no boot sale junk here). There\u2019s also a few eateries dotted around the market as you wander around the stalls, and free toilets in",
          "Amazing market, so many stalls to see, friendly sellers, lots and lots of happy holiday makers and a great location- wander down to the sea if you can - beautiful!",
          "I'd been looking forward to this but was disappointed to find it overly crowded, badly designed and just trashy. There is such potential here, like a row of food stalls selling paella and tapas and other local specialties. But despite the sign advertising paella, all we could",
          "Very busy market with lots of locally made items and a lot of Indian, Far East imported clothes, jewellery and fabrics. Quality of most items was very good and a break from standard high street choices. 2 to 3 hours is more than enough",
          "Big market attractively set under trees. I only saw a couple of stands that were hippy related. We went late afternoon so it wasn\u2019t that hot and not too busy. I found the stalls a bit similar. Clothes, bags, shoes, jewellery. I didn\u2019t see many people buying stuff!",
          "I recommend going first thing for when it opens as it becomes heaving very quickly. It is a must see attraction in Es Cana you can pick up some lovely little gifts and keepsakes for next to nothing or you can splash out on a time piece, there\u2019s something for everyone. I",
          "We visited at 9.30am which is a must if you do not like crowds. Lots of interesting stuff for sale but a lot is the same. Get to it form Santa Eulalia by taxi or boat ferry or walk from the coast. I bought a large wooden naked female torso and some great tie dyed sarongs. An",
          "Not a holiday experience I would repeat We had traveled by bus to look at the next resort and learned the hippie market was on. We followed large crowds of people and eventually arrived at an area consisting of numerous stalls and literally thousands of people who appeared to be",
          "I found this market on tripadvsor when looking for things to do in Ibiza. I'd read through a few of the reviews and so felt I had done enough research to know what to expect. I knew it would be busy, I knew it would be full of tourists, I knew wheat kind of merchandise would be",
          "Opens 10am to 7pm every Wednesday. Best times to go are when it opens or late afternoon. These times are generally a little quieter. Some stalls are repetitive but lots of interesting hand made crafts. Generally, prices are reasonable but a little bartering is recommended.",
          "A lot of the same stalls but there was some nice original art work, jewellery and clothes. Gets a little manic so don't do what I did and go with a hangover",
          "We found lots of really nice souvenirs and also fancy clothes. Of course very busy and hot but still a must see in Ibiza.",
          "We hadn\u2019t been here for many years & really the only change since then is that it\u2019s much bigger & busier now. The market can be reached by bus, ferry or a taxi stopping just outside the entrance, where you can also get a return taxi or go elsewhere. The usual tourist items can",
          "Absolutely something for every one fabulous atmosphere great place. Plenty of parking if your arriving by car. Or have a nice walk from local bus stop. But don't miss this opportunity to visit if you can.",
          "If you have a pram or young children I\u2019d recommend going as early as possible. It gets incredibly crowded and hard to manoeuvre with the crowds. There are some lovely things being sold here....but after a while the stuff is regurgitated around the market! It\u2019s a nice morning out",
          "What a place, don\u2019t know where to start really, so from the beginning i guess, you pay \u20ac4 to park and this is advisable as parking is hard when the markets on You make your way to the market past a group of drummers or rather buskers who entertain you, I\u2019d say it\u2019s customary to",
          "We always head for the hippy market when in es Cana because it\u2019s never samey if you know what I mean Around every twist and turn there\u2019s always a difference experience that awaits you And some great haggling lol Love it and a must visit when in ES CANA",
          "If you are on holiday in Ibiza you must visit the hippy market. Plenty to see a good range of goods and a great vibe.",
          "A fun day shopping great experience lots of stalls and lots of variety reasonably priced products for a variety of buyers",
          "The hippy market is an experience for sure but I have never been so hot or in such a crowded place. We were advised to go in the afternoon because coach parties go in the morning but I honestly can't see how it could be busier! Not the place to go if you suffer from heat or a",
          "jee wiz..what a hot, sticky. mobbed, claustrophobic shambles of a place...just stall after stall after stall ALL of the same leather / jewelled crap...dangerous as well , plenty of stalls lead to dead end no escape routes..would NEVER get away with this here.",
          "Well worth a look around. Very busy so not great if you have young children and pushchair but great atmosphere",
          "Used to be good several years ago.It had a hippy band playing drums and bongos,but sadly,only one of that band there today.No other bands playing except for one in the bar area,and then only in the afternoon.Loads of tat stalls selling the same things a local gift shops.We",
          "A lovely market Very busy and hot, but a nice way to spend a few hours of the holiday. Some nice \"quirky \" things to be bought",
          "Lots to see here, it is packed with stalls selling lots of local hand made products. Very busy so get there early. My wife had bought 2 dresses before I could get her out!",
          "Visited on what was the hottest day of our stay and because of the closed in walk ways, the heat was stifling, but that aside, the stalls and goods for sale were really interesting and plenty of variety. You need a good couple of hours to get round all the stalls, well worth a",
          "I have visited this Hippy Market many times over the years , but I gave it a miss for the last few years because it got boring. I visited again this month and I was pleasantly surprised ! It\u2019s suddenly got very interesting again , with unusual characters dotted here with great",
          "We went before we left Ibiza and OMG the crowds. Not a place with a toddler. We went at 12noon and the crowds where unreal. We bought nothing. It wasnt very cheap for products. Same stuff on most stalls. Jewellery, clothes, leather bags etc. If your into this type of thing",
          "I had very high expectations for this market but It was really disappointing. Nothing original, nothing hippy; just lots of things that you can find everywhere (and cheaper!). I\u2019d suggest to go to the beach instead.",
          "This was my in our hotel, fun and friendly would be a laugh if in the area Clothes and gifts generally inc jewellery and sarongs",
          "About a hour bus from San Antonio then a ten minute walk followed the crowds as no direction given from bus! Very very busy struggle to walk at times which took away from experience as couldn't get to see all stalls.",
          "Hippy market? Maybe? There was someone dressed up as one. Expensive, brought some clothes for our baby and then found the same clothes in a beach front shop for a lot cheaper. You are paying for the gimmick of it being hippy! It\u2019s so busy, and very hot take water! Something",
          "Visited with some friends and our kids of all ages. Kids surely enjoyed checking out what's on offer. Adults felt it was too small and not too much variety was on offer. Booths were selling a wide selection ranging from clothing, accessories, photo booths and very few food",
          "Very busy. Very touristy. A bit like Camden Market without as many goths and no rain. Lots and lots of the same sorts of clothes and jewellery. All quite pricey considering mostly imported - although that might have been the exchange rate to be fair. We paid \u20ac4 to park and then",
          "Atmospheric and vast number of stalls- sensibly priced and some nice purchases made. The central bar area has a good music area.",
          "You will find something for everyone in this place. It\u2019s a wonderful market to get lost in for an hour or so.",
          "My wife and I visited this market on our first day. It was extremely hot and very overcrowded. Would recommend you go later when the temperature is a bit cooler. To be honest most of the items on sale can be purchased in the resorts. Wasn\u2019t what I expected. Kind of expected",
          "Well Worth a visit but go early as it gets very hot & very busy. Lots to see & a good vibe. Friendly stall holders.",
          "You can easily spent a whole day. There is a lot of stuf for everyone! You have to go there once. Each Wednesday from 10-19h. So many things to buy. Typical Ibiza but also other local stuf.",
          "As the summary suggests, the Hippy Market is a place in which it is easy to go round and round in circles. We did go in August, peak tourist season, so perhaps in may be less sprawling at other times. There were only really a few stalls selling stuff that you might classify as",
          "I went with my partner at 11 in the morning. We found it way too busy so we only stayed for 20 minutes. However it is large, but all the stalls basically sell the same thing. Once you have been up one stretch you have basically been around all of them. However, worth a visit if",
          "We tried to go today but it was extremely busy and you could hardly move so we only saw a small part of it.. I would recommend going before 11am or after 4pm.",
          "While we had a good time wandering around this market looking at the various stalls, it became quickly clear that what maybe once was a 'hippy' scene has become more of a tourist attraction with similar tat being sold in the majority of stalls and coca cola and red bull branded",
          "Ok market have few things u would find on beatch like nickless fake tatos. Nothing special but nice tonsee if in area",
          "enjoyed it here was some really nice stalls bought a singing bowl and jewellary you can use youre card to so all good",
          "Not for young children, who want to touch everything they see, we were told off by some stall holders, and other frowned at us, the cafes were full, it was extremely busy and at times so crowded that you couldn\u2019t even see the stalls anyway. Maybe if I was in my 20s and single I",
          "Very crowded but very interesting and lots to look at. Food and drinks stalls available at reasonable prices. Some entertainment available, we saw two men playing bongos along a street and near the entrance families could queue up to get photos with the children dressed in",
          "Busy, hot, eclectic collection of hundreds of market stalls in Es Cana. We travelled via ferry from Santa Eulalia and the market is a 5 to 10 minute walk from the harbour. It's obvious when you get there, you can't miss it. The market stalls sell a predictable blend of",
          "Very much enjoyed a late afternoon wander. Lots of stalls and beautiful pieces of jewellery/clothes along with food and drink!",
          "We visited the market a couple of weeks ago as it seemed to be one of the 'go-to' sites... I'm glad we went by public bus rather than the tour operator excursion as it cost 10\u20ac instead of 50!!!! It was so hot and so incredibly busy we almost felt like we were herded between the",
          "We visited the hippy market and we were there for 10am and it was very busy then! It is definitely worth a visit, you can get some great stuff here but I have to admit it's a bit repetitive. It's not cheap but you can do a bit of bartering with some if the stall holders.",
          "I tend ro visit all market when visit a town and I was very impressed with the size and the type of market they have all almost different things to show and offer and very creative I will recommend to go as it\u2019s quiet good place and also you have a great view from one of the",
          "Only great vibes!! We discovered a different side of Ibiza which is just amazing!! The market is lovey, amazing stuff...get ready with your wallet and cash!! We also had paella at the market!! shame it doyens;t last an entire week!!",
          "We had visited market years ago .but now it\u2019s expensive and too me it just repeating itself. I think more street entertainment is needed.its Just hippie clothes and jewellery .which is cheaper in the town areas",
          "Had to come early morning thinking there wouldn\u2019t be as many people there at that time... We were wrong. It was so busy and you struggled to walk anywhere or even look at the stands. However there were plenty of things on offer from fans to jewellery. There is a nice bar at the",
          "Very hot and repetitive with the stalls all selling the same selection. Was an experience but we didn\u2019t buy anything as it was cheaper elsewhere. Take water in with you as the bottles of water in the market is a rip off.",
          "We got recommended this market by our hotel rep. Wow!! What an experience, all of the jewellery hand made and so beautiful. Everyone is very friendly and you can really appreciate the time and effort that goes into there work. Definitely worth a visit for little gifts for back",
          "This market is huge and some really unusual things to buy. I wouldn't say anything is cheap but lovely clothes & jewellery for gifts. Well worth avisit",
          "we went to the market to try and get large Ibiza Cotton Rugs and decorative Geckos for our Patio in the garden, we went up early hoping to grab a bargain,,, how wrong we were !! this place charges twice the amount you can get goods in the supermarkets !! it has also a very large",
          "Nothing exciting, we found a few things but a lot of the stalls were the same. Also every jewellery stall lied saying their jewellery is real silver but it's actually silver plated or sterling so many people were falling for their lies. They were selling these things for like",
          "We stopped at the Market while exploring the island. It was crowded and hot and if it weren't for that, we would have spent more time perusing all the booths. We did find some good deals on jewelry but there was a lot of the same stuff in each aisle. I guess you could say",
          "Lots of nice stalls, a lot of the stalls Re the same. a 5 minute walk to the beach, Es Cana is lovely it\u2019s cost 10 euros to get from santa Eul\u00e0lia to Es Cana in taxi",
          "If you\u2019re into markets then this will be great as there\u2019s lots on offer and some things that even I, a traditionally tight person, bought. It was great.",
          "Was advised to go early as hotel receptionist told me it would get really busy so headed first thing. Worth a visit.",
          "My children and I really loved visiting Punta Arabi hippy market during our holiday in Es Cana. Great range of items on sale. We were very lucky to hear Jahbless play in the market bar. Along with many other people, we danced away to their cool reggae beat.",
          "I am glad we were staying only a 5-minute walk away from the Hippy Market. I would be very disappointed to have travelled across the island to this 'market'. If this is been hyped (or hippied) as a must-see, Ibiza has very little to see which is not the case! We arrived around",
          "Just go, you can't say you've experienced this magical island unless you visit the \"Hippy Market.\" Duh.",
          "Awful - walked in only stayed less than 10 minutes at the most as you were carried around by other people, what I did manage to see you could buy in the local shops - got fast... awful.",
          "Was told the hippy market was a must see place. Well I\u2019m not sure what people are used to but I really didn\u2019t get the attraction. Plenty of stalls selling the goods, jewellery, handbags and so on but very samesy. We went as soon as it opened so didn\u2019t experience the crowds and",
          "We visited here the last Wednesday of our holiday, after coming here over 20 years ago we were looking forward to it, to be honest it was a let down 95% of the products on offer you could buy in the nic nak shops in the town. At our lower price, it\u2019s very commercialised and was",
          "This was a nice place to visit. The market is just on a Wednesday. There\u2019s a good holiday vibe there. Even if you don\u2019t buy anything it\u2019s worth a visit. Prices are fairly normal and you can\u2019t seem to haggle anything down as prices are set. A good experience though and a nice",
          "Always wanted to go to the hippy market and this year we were staying at Santa Eulalia , just a short taxi ride away. We got there just after it opened at 10am and it was fine, not too many people there. It is massive, with 100's of stalls it was hard to know what to look at",
          "Been holidaying in ibiza for over 10 years and had never been before.Because we were staying in es cana this time and didn't need to get a bus we decided to go.We really enjoyed it a lot of stalls with different things on .We went early so it was not that busy probably wouldn't",
          "Absolutely incredible!! Such an experience & so worth it. Free entry to the market - so many stalls (covered too) so there is some shade which is nice. The paella was great too well priced for a massive plate! Not a long walk from the Es Cana beach - just take some water for",
          "its so packed and very hot and every stall sells the same rubbish dont bother unless you want to buy rubbish",
          "We decided to go in the morning thinking people would wait until the afternoon to visit. How wrong were we. The market is way too crowded. Badly designed and organised. Felt like I was in a maze and we actually couldn\u2019t find the way out. It would be so easy to loose small",
          "We drove there, parking was easy cost \u20ac4, plenty to look at and very busy on Wednesday, you can spend a good few hours there easily or stay all day! Plenty in the area to visit, eat and shop! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Bought a few pieces of holiday clothing, was cheap although I",
          "Thought this market would be a travel back to better days. Wrong full of the same tat that local shops sell only dearer in the market. Not many hippies there but a lot of New Age travellers. Free entry but very crowded",
          "Very hot and crowded would not revisit but if you can tolerate the heat you may enjoy the experience.",
          "This was too hot, badly laid out especially during busy months. Very narrow passageways around stalls and no space to stop and look at the stalls especially when buggies came round. Stalls are VERY repetitive, a million basic jewellery stalls and a lot of the stuff you can get",
          "Lots of stalls to look at that have different things such as jewellery, clothes, hand made gifts and lots more! There are performers throughout the market as well. We stopped off at the cafe for watermelon which was very refreshing! It gets quite busy so would advise to go",
          "Most of the stalls are very similar, selling items that you can get in the shops a lot cheaper, there is however lots of stalls to see but it does get very busy. We only had a ten minute walk to get there, if we had made a special effort to get there it would have been a big",
          "Visited the Hippy Market whilst on holiday with my husband as it was apparently a must see if in Es Can\u00e1. Both of us were very disappointed, lots and lots of stalls selling basically the same stuff eg leather goods, tea shirts, bags, sunglasses etc and not cheap either. If we",
          "Attended late afternoon but still stiflingly hot. Many stalls selling similar goods which i felt could be brought elsewhere for similar price. Felt cramped and busy but does have cafe and toilet facilities. Not sure i would return although teenage daughter bought a few things.",
          "This was ok, but only the same items sold as in the local shops and stalls in town. Go early or late as I imagine it's unbearable at peak times. Been once, glad we went, but won't go again. Possibly better with a girly group, hubby stomped round with that look all wives know",
          "We visited here durimg our 2 week stay in Es Canar. A lot of people love the market but it was not for me. Too many people so even if you see something you want to look at you can't because it is so busy.",
          "Went here while in Es Cana staying. There was a huge variety of stalls and would have spent all day there if it wasn\u2019t for the intense heat. There is a lot of browsing to be done and they have facilities for parking nearby",
          "This was my second time visiting the market and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Last time I visited it was lunchtime and it was far too busy and hot, this time I visited first thing (10am) and it was so much better. Could get to the stalls and have a good look without bumping into",
          "We have been twice now and love it. It\u2019s very hot there so young children can get ratty after a while but well worth a look \ud83d\udc40",
          "Went to the Hippie Market and found it to be a great place. Loads to see and very vibrant and colourful. Would recommend a visit here but go early, gets busy very quickly.",
          "We went to the market on a really sunny day. Even though it was a very busy market, it was still possible to check out every stand. The young children found it not very interesting, we didn't see any entertainment for them.",
          "Lots to see, hear and smell! Very busy. We were staying at the hotel so had to walk through it to the restaurant etc. We preferred the evening just before they packed up as it was a bit quieter and cooler. The stalls are quite expensive but some nice bits on offer for sale",
          "I went on a trip here on a bus. many hotels offer the service of a bus to the market. There is parking ( 4 euro fee) and is directly beside the market. The people are lovely and live music is almost always playing, you are allowed to try talk the price down but if they say no",
          "Lots of interesting stalls , some items you can find at any touristy places but some unique items such as dresses/ clothing. Very hot even in the late afternoon under the canopies but worth it if you can manage to haggle down the prices (even though they\u2019re very stubborn)!",
          "We drove one and a half hour to visit the hippie market and expected to find something quite different and spectacular from what we have previously experienced in other tourist areas abroad. But we found the same type of clothing, bags, jewelry etc as in other markets, so I",
          "Not your typical market stalls you find on holidays. All handmade goods. More expensive than the usual holiday tat. Go early in the morning as it is very busy. Mostly sells jewellery, clothes, leather goods and trinkets. Gorgeous stuff and a lovely way to spend a few hours.",
          "Great setting but stalls selling goods at a very expensive rate. You could pick a lot of the items up at half the price in ES Cana",
          "Was in Ibiza for a day on a cruise and had to see what a Hippy Market was. It was interesting. Lots of craft sellers. I just need to warn everyone that it is crammed with people. But if you are looking for an interesting cultural experience, check it out.",
          "Day trip to the hippie market. Lots to see. Some really beautiful jewellery and gorgeous clothes. It was a scorching hot day and we stopped for drinks which were surprisingly cheap. Must admit I thought we were gonna be charged through the nose and was pleasantly surprised. It",
          "Went to this market not really knowing what to expect. Travelled here from Port Des Torrent in a hired car which was easy enough. Had the pleasure of a 4 euro parking price. The market itself is in some ways repetitive. A lot of the stalls are similar but there are a good few",
          "The market is a great experience, lots to take in, music, street performers (human statues) all fab great buzz and atmosphere. Some lovely items but beware of prices, some fine, some cheaper in local shops. My 5 year old wanted her face painted up at the hippy kids area. Totally",
          "We were slightly disappointed as it's sold as traditional handcrafts, but the reality is that it's pretty much like any market, although the music areas are entertaining (and under shade). Make sure you have water and find a cool place to sit when you need a break. We visited in",
          "It was an intense experience there is so much going on around you its hard to take it all in pre warning take water cause it gets really hot in there",
          "We walked here as we were staying in Es Cana and got there at 10am as soon as it opened so it was less busy and you could walk around freely but not all the stalls were set up some were still arriving. Within an hour the market was packed, you could hardly move (just move with",
          "I\u2019ve been coming to Ibiza for over 20 years. This market has sold its soul to the devil. Most of the stuff is on repeat, stall after stall of the same overpriced clothes and jewellery. Even the Tantric mediating monk wants a few Euros. It won\u2019t be long before they start charging",
          "we visited 4th july. was a good visit, 15min walk from our hotel. we went around 10:30am, had the pram and it was extreamly busy and hot so we didnt stay long but had a good walk round most of it",
          "Rubbish.! Cheap and nasty goods which can be found anywhere. Very old hat tribute to long gone days.",
          "We loved the Hippy Market. Chance to see and enjoy local art and craft plus listen to hippy music and enjoy food and drink. Paella was amazing and local craft beer top notch. Recommend highly.",
          "Live music. Stalls everywhere. Very hot. Not a cheap market but worth a look anyway. 4\u20ac to park for the day but it doesn't take a day. Morning visit is enough.",
          "Great day out. It does very busy and hot (obviously) but there are plenty of stalls offering refreshments. Lovely items on sale, we bought dresses, jewellery, t-shirts. Take cash with you though as the 2 ATMs on site were out of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 and due to limited WiFi a lot of stalls on",
          "We stayed in Es Cana and so only up the road - pleasantly surprised it was not cheap tacky stuff- though a bit repetitive definitely worth a visit even for a morning or afternoon session. Easy to get to and parking available if driving but probably get there early to get a spot.",
          "Had an amazing visit to the Hippy Market where we one afternoon. Great vibe and atmosphere and had our photo at the Hippy market taken by a lovely group of women who you cab see love their job!! If visiting Ibiza I would highly recommend the Hippy Market!!",
          "Unsure of the hype on this one, 500 very similar stalls selling stuff you can get at virtually any tat shop everywhere across the island. Crazily busy and roasting hot. Visit if you want holiday cornrows, a henna tattoo, dreamcatcher or a fridge magnet. I\u2019ll pass.",
          "An absolutely huge market selling a wide variety of goods. On a Wednesday the hotel complex turns into a giant hippie market with stalls, shops, bars,restaurants etc. Well worth a visit.",
          "Full of character and amazing hand made goods... great place to go to experience the Ibiza lifestyle and see the fab fashions Recommend to visit x",
          "Some nice stalls, especially jewellery,throws, cushions etc but lots of things I wouldn\u2019t expect to see. Nice to visit but wouldn\u2019t go again.",
          "It was not worth paying the 3,50\u20ac parking fee what a waste of time and the Shops are all the same so what is so nice?",
          "Too hot, crowded, and stalls nearly all the same stuff. Got bus there and the boat back, that was the best bit. Worth a look around es cana though.",
          "I was surprised how big this market was, it was huge. Very busy but lots to see, clothes, crafts, jewellery, bags, linen etc and there are refreshment stalls to keep you hydrated along the way. There is also a cash machine outside but I fear it is the slowest in Europe so get",
          "Has to be said this was a real breath of fresh air after spending the first few days looking at that in the shops. Not really for the bargain hunters but if you like hand made individual goods this is definitely for you. Take my word for it don't buy any momentos until you've",
          "A must do day trip. Stalls are very different and unique. A really warm day. Take water with you so you don\u2019t dehydrate. There are of course places to buy drinks",
          "This is a large market with plenty of eating places. All the stalls are very similar and exactly what it says, \"Hippy\" If your not a Hippy 30mins is enough.",
          "Do not go in the middle of the day as it gets very hot. A varied array of stalls. Also places to purchase food and drink",
          "Great visit. Very busy but nice atmosphere. Many many stalls quite a lot selling the same stuff. Best time to visit early morning or later in day. Open until 7pm atm and 8pm at high season.",
          "Catch the local buses to Es Canar Hippy Market, as it saves you a fortune over the Land trains or Water taxis. the Market is Ok, bit overpriced a lot of stuff cheaper in shops on main road on way up to the market, crazy manic crowds in morning go afternoon it's quiet and chilled",
          "Although a lot of the stalls are the same sellers from Las Dalias, this place just felt better and there were more affordable stalls other than boutique \u20ac100+ clothes on offer!",
          "Recommend to anyone visiting the area to visit this market! A nice few hours out! There is lots of goods on offer as well as somewhere to sit and have a drink or a snack!",
          "The Hippy Market at Punta Arabia is now celebrating 45 years. It is always busy and is held on a Wednesday at Punta Arabia, which is within easy walking distance (so long as you are well) from Es Cana. It gets very very busy and has lots of stalls selling clothes",
          "It's worth a trip to the Hippy Market if you are staying in the area. The market opens at 10am so best to get there early as it can get very busy and hot!! Very colourful characters and stalls, take a camera. Lots to see definately worth a trip.",
          "lots of advertising a visit to the Hippy Market as a must go to place so we did it, was packed heaving and not pleasant could not really see much as there were just too many people there it was too hot and no escape, the stall we did get a look at were just same tee shirts and",
          "We stopped at the hotel were they held the hippy market , it was fantastic so many stalls and some really lovely things , You could very easily spend a fortune \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Definitely worth going to see the market",
          "Worth a visit although lots of stalls selling the same. Not far to walk if staying in Es Canar it go early as it get very busy indeed",
          "Why not have a look on the way back from beach or just before you dine. Clothes, jewlery, tattoos,plaques, hair, treat ur self. Face body temp tattoos before you go out clubbing good price.",
          "Very very busy we got there about 10ish was already busy left about 2 By then was heaving , got a few bits for grandkids but lot of stuff the same and expensive , would recommend experience but go early gets very hot",
          "Had another good visit here, it\u2019s very busy and chaotic but worth the visit with some bargains to be found, always look round first as some shops are a lot more expansive than others.",
          "Great place to spend a couple of hours, browsing the stalls, got a henna tattoo and some funky gifts to take home",
          "Very expensive tat which you can get in most of the shops for half the price worth a walk round for a hr or so if you have nowt better to do",
          "Very busy market. Much of the same on each stall. Worth a visit but hold on to small children they can be easily lost.",
          "Just get there early such a crush And a bit like spaghetti junction bit hard to find way out some stuff very expensive",
          "Large market with varied stalls - some tacky but also some quality. Good luck getting round it though - can\u2019t imagine it in peak season - couldn\u2019t move in a lot of it.",
          "I was disappointed two years ago to miss out on this being open when I was in Ibiza. This time round, I was disappointed it was open. It\u2019s clear to see that it was once something really special, but it seemed repetitive, a bit like a maze and 95%+ of people didn\u2019t buy a thing.",
          "Over priced and very repetitive. Can't be the only one with this opinion as very few people looked to have purchased anything.",
          "Honestly it was worth a bus ride out to see a bit more of the island but it was a bit rubbish to be fair , overpriced cheaply made stuff , some nice bits and bobs but we had a better market in portinatx. far to busy and expensive.",
          "We had a very good visit but the market was very busy .A good variety of goods for sale. Great atmosphere \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "a great place to experiance some things cheeper in shops but nice to have a wonderound before it gets busy.",
          "Me and my husband went here for a day out whilst on our honeymoon. We absolutely loved it!! It was so full of color, culture, interesting people, music, food, drink and dancing. I bought the most amazing vintage pin up girl post cards with Ibiza on them and they were so",
          "We saw this advertised thought it might be 9ntetesting coach trip 25 Euro each that\u2019s nearly \u00a350 from portinatx,it\u2019s only 20 minutes down the rd seems a bit expensive!but we had a hire car so we went and wandered round fair size place it was packed I noticed the armed gardia",
          "I was severely hungover but I adored this market ! Would have loved to spend hours here but I was too fragile on the day!",
          "It's just about ok. It may be unique in Ibiza but you can find equivalent or better markets in many other cities.",
          "Make sure you visit, we went for a few hours and bought a few funky things and even had a charicture done. Well worth it.",
          "what an expereance ,but by mid day it can be very hot and busy ,try and go early or later people come from all over the island ,make shure you have some water to drink.",
          "A magical kaleidoscope of wonderous items only thought of in dreams!! Trinkets of all kinds for all people! Mystical atmosphere, accompanied with rustic music! The epitome of happiness for every hippy!",
          "Great market very busy lots to see and do and the area outside is brill for beach and food! Lovely little place",
          "Originally visited around 40 years ago!!! This experience wasn't quite as comfortable and enjoyable as that visit!!! We were staying in Es Cana, so walk of about 15-20 minutes which was fine as we visited in middle of May and weather was surprisingly less cool than expected,",
          "have been here a few times over the years, nice to visit but its a been once dont need to bother again type of place. selling overpriced tat really but if your into crafty hippy stuff its good. nice stall in the middle selling fresh cut fruit and juices despite being very",
          "This hippy market was set in a hotel so up hill walking & very busy. I loved walking round & seeing different things to see & buy. But if you don\u2019t like smell of marijuana I\u2019d stay clear as it seems a lot of people smoke it there.",
          "Good for a day out , in the market there\u2019s lots of items for sale but it\u2019s stuff you find everywhere. Camden Lock , Anjuna, etc lots of type dye pieces. It\u2019s generally not to my taste , but there\u2019s one excellent vintage stall at the beginning selling genuine seventies Hippy",
          "Too busy and too packed together. It seemed like everywhere I looked someone was smoking so it was like walking through a smoke cloud, and the stalls didn't even look like they were selling authentic hippy goods. Total waste of time.",
          "... we were told that this market is super touristic, but did not expect that: already entering the market you are barely able to move or go to a stall because there are tourists everywhere... you kind of move in the direction everyone moves, go with the flow along the same",
          "We got a taxi from santa eulalia which was 10 euros. Extremely busy but we expected this. It ruins it a bit but it's still worth going as there's some really interesting stalls. We got lost though. The place is like a maze and the maps aren't very helpful. We were only there",
          "Heaving with crowds which meant trying to walk was incredibly slow going, Prices when you asked about an item were not cheap and like a lot of markets a lot of stalls all selling the same. Would be difficult for elderly or less mobile people to manage due to the crowds",
          "Well worth a visit for the atmosphere sights and sounds. Very few things are priced and I think its a bit annoying having to ask how much all of the time. Mostly I thought the prices were high, some good buys but alot of the clothing available cheaper in the shops. Good for two",
          "Absolutely amazing market very recommended lovely place easy to get to and plenty of places to park the market has so many stools and eating area and drinks available recommend day out just avoid midday very hot and very busy",
          "Nothing special about this place and not worth the visit unless you are in the area. Certainly do not go to the trouble of catching a bus. I imagine this market was everything I had expected it to be 30 years ago. Now it's just big business and everyone wants a slice of the",
          "The market was a short walk from the hotel, and there was a great variety of stalls and events - from handmade crafts, clothing, jewellery, Knick knacks, sketches, street music, and a great little place in the middle to get a drink and a bite to eat. There\u2019s also a proper loo",
          "30-40 minutes drive from San Antonio / Cala Gracio. Lots of parking available, \u20ac4 for the whole day (until midnight). The market is busy and colourful with a nice atmosphere. A lot of the walkways are shaded by trees or fabrics etc making it much cooler and pleasant to walk",
          "Great market just too busy with small kids it was like sardines in a tin! Good fun though and got some nice bits to take home",
          "When we were staying near Santa Eulalia we went to the Hippy Market. It is huge ( over 500 stalls ) selling every kind of artisan craft imaginable. You must allow 3/4 hours and go early.",
          "lots to see, lots of orginal items and art works. some a bit pricey and worth a haggle. very hilly and gravel so if u you have a push chair its a bit of a nightmare in some places. very very busy, not sure if theyre is a quiet time we went at 11am and mobbed,but worth the",
          "Nice market. Most of the walking is beneath green trees, shady. Lots of space and area to sit and lunch. Parking is well organized. We have been to the Las Dalias Hippy market too. Both are great and nice. Although, Las Dalias had a more authentic feel ( a backyard marketplace",
          "Had a walk around as we were only staying down the road so within walking distance. A lot of the stalls were the same but it\u2019s a nice way to spend an hour or two.",
          "This is brilliant and funny too watching people getting dressed up in the hippy outfits. It's well worth a visit. Would definitely go back to the hippy market again",
          "I didn\u2019t particularly fancy going but I went and thoroughly enjoyed it. Loads of choice of products. Superb for people watching. We bought some interesting stuff as well. A hat for me , shoes for my wife and clothes for our daughter. It\u2019s great fun and in a great setting. Go",
          "We had a lovely walk to Es Can\u00e1 to get to the Hippy Market. Market is very overwhelming as it\u2019s very busy and lots of stalls and tones of people. Would not recommend if you don\u2019t like crowds. It was very hot and lots of crowds made it a little hard to get to have a proper look",
          "Paid \u20ac4 to park as it was the only space we could find.Very busy, barely enough room to move and the stalls all sell pretty much the same stuff and quite expensive, We seen maybe one or two stalls that had unique handmade products, the rest were straight from a cash and carry.",
          "Only 10 minutes walk, sells usual art, leather and silver. Slightly over priced but it\u2019s a tourist attraction so expected",
          "Always worth a visit! Strolling around and looking for nice things to buy is big fun there. Can be a \u201cbit\u201d crowded - we usually go early if we want to buy things or late if we only want to look around.",
          "As to be expected when visiting Ibiza as the island has a hippie history. Plenty of items on sale such as wood carvings, bandanas, clothes and all sorts of other stuff. However a lot of the stalls sell the same items so not great variety. There are also bands playing music so if",
          "If you\u2019re in the area then pop over - \u20ac4 for car parking with about four different car parks. It is really busy and more like a glorified car boot. Make your own mind up but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it so stay on the beach (or go to Canar beach itself which is beautiful).",
          "This place has an excellent buzz to it, we were expecting a typical flea market but the choice and detail of the products was excellent. We were very lucky as a local band called Azibi we\u2019re playing and they were outstanding.",
          "Great place, nice people, good and cheap food, amazing for shopping maniacs but of course for cool hippy clothing",
          "We heard about a hippy market in Ibiza and decided to go there. There was enough parking space in the village for 3 euro to 4 euro. We been there for about 2 hours and enjoyed! The atmosphere was great.",
          "It was always on my list to hit the hippy market on my second visit to Ibiza, so myself and daughter with some friends we had met on holiday decided to take the day trip ferry from portinax to es cana where the hippy market is - took about an hour on the ferry and was lovely to",
          "Classic hippie market, it is not so big but there is everything to buy, to eat, music and a great atmosphere. A lot of people go there and it's very close to the bus station in case you do not go by car. Excellent excursion",
          "Didn't expect too much from this but was pleasantly surprised. Well laid out stalls, good quality produce and clean and reasonably priced eating and drinking options",
          "Kids liked some of the stalls but in general a lot of the stuff was overpriced. We bought some bracelets and things . Ok for an afternoon .",
          "Fab place, hand crafts & typical holiday market souvenirs. Approximately 5 minutes walk from sea front.",
          "Prices are well overpriced for the exact same stuff that they have in the shops, really did not see what was hippy about it never seen anything hippy like smoking etc... very crowded but okay for a walk around, a man being a statue wanted \u20ac5 for a picture I refused no thanks",
          "There are so many lovely hand made items in the hippy market. its not that far of a walk from the main shops. would recommend a visit. We also really enjoyed eating the freshly cut watermelon",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Gets very busy with tourists from all countries coming to have a look round but worth the hustle bustle. Stalls selling everything from clothes to handmade jewellery and household items. Separate area for food stalls in the centre. Entertainment for",
          "The vibe in this place is incredibly different of what we visited before. Incredibly beautiful handcraft gifts and hippy clothes... We had a caricature made by the artist called Toni in \"the painters square\". So funny and different. We loved it",
          "Staying in es canar it's an easy walk to get there, arrived about 4pm as heard about the coach crowds that arrive earlier in the day. The stalls mostly sell the same not so unique items, either cheaply made clothes that looked the same on nearly every stall from \u00a325 to \u00a3125 or",
          "Expensive tat you can find in many other places at a lot better value!! Very cramped and busy, eating areas no where near enough seating!",
          "Was hopefully looking for something slightly different to the markets we\u2019d already been to but this was typically the same stuff as all the others . On a better note the atmosphere was amazing and lots of places to stop for a drink and food",
          "we went for a look around but we found the stalls very repetitive.Lots of vendors selling the same as each other. The cafe/bar is very expensive but needed.",
          "Returned after 10 yes. And excited to visit. What a disappointment every 2nd stall was jewellery. Or visit lasted about an hour and only bought a bottle of water.",
          "Lots to see and buy. Also lots and lots of people. After 30 mins we left because as a family we kept getting seperated by the human traffic. Lovely atmosphere though and some good live music. Definetly worth a visit.",
          "The market is ok if you happen to be staying in es cana but not really worth the travel if you are staying quite a few miles away. Most of the stalls were selling the same things that you could buy in any shop and were not at all hippy or unique. There was the occasional stall",
          "The market was far better than we expected. Plenty of stalls with a variety of goods on sale. Music was excellent and atmosphere terrific. Not being hippies, we were unsure what to expect but loved it. Bought clothes and leather goods. There were signs up warning of pickpockets",
          "My daughter loved it, my son hates crowds so he left after 5 minutes... some nice souvenirs, like jewelry and clothing. I did not experience the nice food atmosphere, nor the happy music, artist... i cannot imagine how hot and crowded it must be in eg August. If you like",
          "This market it definitely worth a visit. Lots of craft work, t-shirts and hair braiding. It was busy when we visited (so I can imagine it being much worse in the summer months) and the layout of the market leads to bottle necks and 'traffic jams'!",
          "Very interesting and well worth a visit. Spent money and found the items to be higher quality than I expected.",
          "We visited the Hippy market and really enjoyed it but not really suitable if you don't like cramped areas or are claustrophobic, it's mostly uphill and not great for pushchairs but we'll worth a visit",
          "Not worth the visit to be honest, very crowed , difficult to walk around the stalls. People with buggies, etc trying to get past you, a lot of the goods for sale was tourist tat. Wouldn\u2019t recommend this.",
          "Wont be to everyones taste but loved walking around it, similar things being sold i.e. jewellery, clothing & general \u201ctat\u201d but nice tat. Live music being played to suit the market & plenty of stops for snacks & drinks. Worth a wander but is busy & if you\u2019re irritated easily by",
          "Spent a good couple of hours wandering round the market. Great for jewellery, gifts etc.very busy but we'll worth visiting for the atmosphere.",
          "We visited the market because of its reputation as the original hippy market when we were staying in Santa Eulalia in the second week of October. It is certainly an experience - the sheer size could be overwhelming and it was extremely busy, so perhaps it's worth going a little",
          "Great if you love markets although most stalls selling similar items. Got very busy which I don't like but I'm not a shopper. Enjoyed the music from the resident band",
          "Whilst on out stay in Es Cana,we decided to take a stroll to the hippy market which was about 400meters from where we were staying. The market is absolutely massive \ud83d\ude2e but it wasn\u2019t for us unfortunately,all the stalls were selling practically the same stuff! I\u2019m glad i was",
          "Worth a visit if you want to get nick nacks. My partner and I heard good things but we\u2019re a little disappointed as most of the stalls were similar to shops around San Antonio Bay where we were staying. We ended up leaving and looking around the little town instead.",
          "Always visit the hippy market every October. Its still very busy and vibrant this late in the season, the bands the drummers the statues and the 100s of colourful stalls always make for a pleasant few hours visit. See you next year",
          "it\u2019s worth a visit but only if you can cope with hordes of people. it\u2019s a mixture of true artisan craft makers and sellers and the usual mass produced, imported tourist stuff. always worth a haggle.",
          "Nothing really not seen before Didn't buy anything but enjoyed the visit Go early as coach loads arrive later in day",
          "This is a great place to pick up quality gifts along with cheap trinkets. We went early both weeks to ensure that we avoided the crowds. Will definitely visit again on our next visit to Ibiza.",
          "It's nice too see but to be honest it's a lot of stalls with very similar stuff and it's not really my thing. But I'm sure others will love it",
          "Staying in Es Cana, I decided to visit the Hippy Market Market. When I first arrived, it wasn't too bad, but within half an hour, bus after bus arrived each dischorging their passengers and by 11am, it was absolutely heaving, making it near impossible to stop and look at",
          "The hippy market is great pretty big with lots to see and buy there\u2019s music and food A great day out!",
          "Spent an absolute fortune and was too close to a lot of strangers as it was packed. Very easy to be pick pocketed! Worth going to say you've been but that's about its",
          "Wow woohoo many people, this market is packed. I can understand why there are so many stalls. Great atmosphere and by far the best market to go to. Loved the music and loved the bands and you could grab a beer in the tent to cool down from walking about. lots of cool things to",
          "Took the boat trip to go to this market and we were a little disappointed. Nothing particularly special. Very busy. I would not bother on my next visit",
          "Lovely atmosphere but later found the things we bought there for half the price we'd paid in the resort shops.",
          "This market is huge and takes ages to get round. There are lots of places to take a break but it does get very busy and in the heat it can be quite exhausting. We were there in October so even though it was still warm I can imagine it being to hot in the middle of the summer.",
          "Got the service bus to Es Cana expecting a typical Spanish market. We walked 1km from where the bus dropped us. For those with walking difficulties it is difficult to get around. Some ramps which are steep and very uneven surfaces. The clothes sold on the stores were",
          "People advised us that the Hippy Market is a must see in Es Cana. Shopping is one of my least favoured ways to pass time so I'm happy to say that we managed to see enough of the Market in less than 90 minutes. We set off straight after breakfast on foot from our hotel and we",
          "i went for a look when on holiday but not my cup of tea unfortunately loads of stalls but expensive very busy and popular",
          "Even tho it\u2019s very very commercial and you will almost be tramped by other tourists, I still enjoyed it! Parking is nearby and \u20ac4. Make sure you\u2019ll visit in the morning, at least we did, otherwise it\u2019s too crowded I guess. Shop till you drop \ud83d\ude09",
          "Quite nice place with crowds of people coming. Plenty possibilities to buy mainly clothes, etc., however the original hippies would not be be happy with its strictly commercial atmosphere",
          "We visited the hippy market while on our family holiday in Es Cana, Ibiza. It was definitely worth the visit, luckily we were only a 5/10 minute drive from our hotel so didn't have to travel far. The market itself has A LOT of stalls, it seemed to go on forever. It was also",
          "We visited during October still very busy which is great. We wandered around the stalled streets taking in the atmosphere. The highlight for us was the musical acts playing in the central tent. Great talent and we would have happily stayed in there all day! The rest of the",
          "Whilst you can't see an awful lot from the road, this is a sprawling market with hundreds of stalls spread out on both sides of meandering walkways. Goods include many brightly coloured fabrics, clothing, jewellery, CD's, footwear, hats, scarves, smoking materials and there are",
          "Visited on recommendation. Waste of time imho. If you must, go early, or you will be pushed around with the masses! Stuff on sale the usual gear, but can be bought cheaper in town! Greatly disappointed, lasted there about 30 minutes only. ...always thought hippies were anti",
          "Usual stuff, shops outside have the same stuff at lower prices....go if you fancy a wander to pass some time.",
          "It's a shame the artisans get suffocated by the 'same old' stereotypical hippy tat. Once we'd waded through the tat stalks we did end up in a centre tent with an amazing singer/musician and a cool bar was all hooked up. This bit was great but the rest we couldn't wait to get out",
          "If you\u2019ve in Es Canar, it\u2019s a must Various stalls, about half what you see in any \u201ccraft market \u201c but many who who make original products and genuinely hippie inspired Get there just after 9am as they are setting up and you will get the chance to look without the crowds.",
          "Been here several times over the years, yet we still return here as such colourful commercialism and fantastic characters in one place is a rare thing. It can be tricky getting a parking space (so maybe get a bus as they are so cheap on Ibiza anyway) and earlier on it is",
          "Always such amazing things and lovely people x Great place to visit to pick up something original and beautiful and you can usually find a bargain!",
          "Even in October this was still a very busy place. Very commercial with lots of the same things but some of the stands still are hidden gems.",
          "Decent, but not very well layed out and very crowded. Good entertainment though. Bought a couple of little bits.",
          "Our hotel was within walking distance so a stroll down the road - we were advised to get there early as it does get very very busy as they bus in people out of the area - there were loads of stalls lots selling the same things but some really lovely stalls selling local made",

          "A great couple of hours much of the usual stuff on sale but some great music and quirky items sort a visit.",
          "Took the \"train\" to this market. What a waste of money. You can get the local bus for a fraction of the cost. The market was too busy and a possible fire hazard. Also you can buy the same things in town most days. We spent 30 minutes looking around and 1 hour waiting outside to",

          "Well worth a look although its pricey. I justify it by saying. Am on my holidays. Some lovely hippy clothes and gear to be had. 8/10 from me",
          "Sells lots of the same stuff, but pleasant enough for an hour or so. Very clean, plus there was a band playing ear the tented bar, musicians were very good",

          "Lots of people go to this market and it is over hyped. Loads of rubbish for sale under the banners of love and peace. It has out grown its original idea. Hippies using card machines to take payments! I would not recommend visiting this market.",
          "I would say if your nearby it\u2019s worth a trip to see if your on the other side of the island not so much. Personally i got fed up with the stink of people smoking weed granted this isn\u2019t everywhere you go in there but i\u2019m not a fan. There are a great a selection of hand made",
          "Great market for the usual tourist tat - handbags, jewellery, habadashery, clothing - but why is every market in Ibiza called hippy? They are all trying to make money and are no more hippy than Trump. However you can come away with some nice things and if you don't mind rubbing",
          "i always try to go to the market when in escana.there a lot of stalls sell the same stuff as the local shops .but there are some with hand made souveniers.sit and have a drink and listen to some of the local bands enjoy the atmosphere. rsr"

          "Interesting market, very popular. It's a shame there are no local street food vendors there which would have been a nice addition. The stalls that sold locally produced items were nice however there was also the generic stuff you see worldwide. I enjoyed the vibes and the bands were great.",

          "Trinkets and stuff in abundance. But kinda hippie about that at least. ;)",
          "Well worth a visit. It gets very busy and is huge go around at least twice because you're going to miss a turn somewhere and miss out on something",
          "Commercial and other businesses here. Nothing from the original hippy culture whatsoever.\nVery very busy.",
          "A cool & chilled vibe, live music and lots of stalls. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting this beautiful Island.",
          "Interesting choice of random products. Some great bargains. Some tat. The leather belts that are handcrafted while you wait are great quality.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Car parking nearby with a \u20ac4 charge. Very busy and it gets a bit hot.",
          "Lots of variety and people! If you not in the mood for crowds... come back here when the summer is over ;)",
          "Great visit and some lovely things to buy. Fresh juice bar really reasonable prices. Plus listening to Benidrums made the day.",
          "Very crowded, which is probably great for the stall holders, but we couldn't get near the stalls.",
          "Very different place to shop very quirky items for sale",
          "Hippy is right I suppose. If you go expecting a normal market then, like us, you will be mistaken. It was very busy trying to walk around it even though locals said it was quiet until next month! Huge number of stalls selling all sorts of \u2026",
          "Fantastic place. Lots of stalls. Good and music. And no one hassling you",
          "Lots to see... usual hippy market & over priced.... need good haggling skills..lol.\ud83d\ude04",
          "Really enjoyed looking around and purchased a lovely leather shoulder bag at a good price.",
          "Its ok if you have not been before but alot of the stalls are the same.",
          "Its ok, very busy, not sure if it would be better to go in the afternoon when the rush has died down.",
          "If you are into that hippy stuff, it's probably a good thing to attend. The place is packed with people and stuff, people don't need. :-P",
          "The place is way to touristic. If you want to go to a hippy market I suggest that you visit Las Dalias. Atmosphere there is way nicer, and it felt like there were more people who really made something themselves.",
          "Okay, but not what i expected, a bit disappointed really, it's no different from any other market.",
          "If you go to the hippy market in the summer, take a battery operated fan. It's scorching as it is enclosed and walkways are narrow especially for pushchairs and wheelchairs. Cool place but pricey. Check shops in the local areas first but go \u2026",
          "A tourist trap that works surprisingly well. There's nothing authentic about it at all. You can buy most of the same products on AliExpress for a lot less and you won't have to put up with the crowds, the fake hippy salespeople and the \u2026",

          "Go in the morning when its not as busy! Some really nice clothing items but shop around as people sell the same thing at different prices",
          "Definitely worth a look, great place. Watch out for the gangs of pickpockets though!",
          "Back in the past this was a real Hippy Market, and a place for people to swap/trade unused clothes and goods.  Nowadays it's just 1000s of people shuffling around a market looking at stalls, and theres little of the original vibe left. \u2026",
          "Massive let down... Everyone said I should visit but virtually every stall had the same of stuff on it. It was soo hot and crowded I wanted to leave after 5mins.",
          "Tons of stalls, can easily spend a couple of hours wondering around. Don't expect to pick up any bargains though!",
          "Lots of parking nearby but \u20ac4 charge courtesy of those capitalist hippies. The market is very big with loads of stalls mostly of the usual tat (healing crystals, sarongs, jewellery) but also some nice artisan, hand made stuff in the mix.. \u2026",

          "Good to have seen a little much of the same type of things",
          "Not the place to go on a hot day, which is the case on most summer days.  Pick a cloudy day and out of season will be best.  Far too crowded but lots of choice, some good but lots of not so good.  Take a visit by boat to Ibiza Town as a great alternative.",
          "Interesting place to go with lots of locally made products.",
          "Same every year but the music is great and and cocktails was cheap",
          "Loads of reasonably priced goods. More places to eat and drink now which has made it better.",
          "A riot of smells, sounds and colour, loads of stall with unique handcrafted items - not the usual market tat. A great morning out, though does get rather warm, and very busy - watch your pockets!",
          "Always fun, good atmosphere. Rather a lot of replicated stalls .Found what l wanted, a leather bracelet, not available in shop's. Musicians added to the experience !!!",
          "Cool place, a lot good shops and nice athmosphere!",
          "Amazing market that's sells quality handmade goods with music, food and drinks to enhance the experience",
          "Worth a visit. But generally overpriced tat that you can by cheaper in the surrounding shops.",
          "Very very touristy & quite expensive. I bet it was great in the 70's, when they weren't welcome.",
          "Relaxing day out browsing the stalls and taking in the laid back atmosphere",
          "Ehm.... China town \nDon't miss the hippy picture on the entrance though",

          "Love the hippy market.  Full of interesting stalls and unique items.",
          "VERY crowded! There are a few original stands. Music was the best bit",
          "It is mostly the same vendors every year, but it is still worth visiting more than once in your lifetime. There is usually live music entertainment under the hut during the day. Great atmosphere and vibes. I have never had a bad experience \u2026",
          "Almost everyone is selling a slightly different collection of goods that you can find on Amazon or in abundance at souvenir shops throughout the island. If you are nearby and it is no extra trouble for you to go I recommend it for the \u2026",
          "Not my sort of thing but great if you like little trinkets, remember to barter with the stall holders, I would advise to get there for opening st 10am as it was very very busy by 11am and spent alot of time queing to get around",

          "A labrinth of cool and interesting  clothes and jewellery  and interesting  stuff gets very busy though",

          "Very interesting, it\u2019s like your in a time warp",
          "An absolute nightmare. Very very overcrowded. The items they sell is mostly stuff you can buy anywhere else and cheaper. Not a lot of Ibizan handmade items. Just random clothes (made in Bangladesh) and even made in China mugs. You can find \u2026",
          "Good day out, a bit pricey but lovely stuff. Take water cause it gets very humid!",
          "Such a shame that this place has gotten so commercial over the last 20 to 30 years . So much that being sold and simply because it is sold to you by someone wearing a tye dye it don't mean it is anything to do with hippies . That said it does bring tourism to Es Cana which is now a really nice resort",
          "I was a bit disappointed with the hippy market. It was very busy, difficult to get to some stalls and seemed very commercialized. Far from its original setup I would say....",
          "The problem is, it was set up to be survivalist and unique.\nHowever very little is made there now, and it is very capitalist.\nMuch more expensive than normal retail..",
          "Too commercial. Too many people. Not authentic.",
          "Lovely market. Been coming here for years.",
          "Nice place to be on Wednesday. Prices are quite high, not many options to eat",
          "Amazing complex.  Beautiful individual little houses.  Food is very varied and good.  Would go there again",
          "Nice Hippy Market. It bit more commercial than Las Dalias. And a lot bigger. There's always something here that you would like to have. It's a great place for souvenirs and not that expensive. You can also have a drinkt there, like the mojito in the picture (\u20ac5).",
          "Quantity over quality but a few really nice stalls with some amazing hand made products (although they can be easily missed amongst the many stalls selling the same factory made stuff you see in the shops). \n\nA few places permanent \u2026",
          "Get there early (before opening time) and it's not a bad experience. Crowds are low and the weather tolerable. But after 10:30 it becomes nearly unbearable - narrow passageways packed full of people, very hot and a lot of stalls selling a lot of the same merch. Worth a visit first thing but get out once the crowds arrive.",
          "Must see when you are around. Great market.",
          "Good place to buy souvenirs of what remains of the hippy movement...",
          "Very busy best to go about 2pm to avoid the  crowd",
          "We enjoyed our time at the hippy market despite the heat which was unbearable at times. Recommend it!",
          "What a market!!! Loads and loads of stalls, but absolutely packed well worth a visit",
          "Great for people watching but not for bargains t-shirts cheaper in Es cana shops..go early it fills up pretty quickly..",
          "The hippy market was full of stalls roughly 250 with necklaces, earings, dream catchers ,tee-shirts\nAnd paintings, worth a look, there is also bands playing and food huts,, good afternoon ,it's 300m from es canar",

          "its changed alot over the years and its more commercialized now. such a shame.",
          "Nice market with lots of good offers. A very nice atmosph\u00e8re. We liked the band which was playing there very much. This market is a must!",
          "Great place, not a great variety of different stuff but HAGLE. You will get a bargain",
          "Not a place for me \nWife and Grand daughter liked it.",
          "Packed out hard to navigate. Went years ago and loved it now just selling overpriced junk for the tourist, there's a lot of hype about it but if I were you I would give it a miss",
          "Tourist trap with generic trinkets for sale but one of these standard things to visit",
          "Very busy but great day out",
          "It was ok most stalls were very selling the  same overpriced stuff",
          "Nice mixture of goods sold on the stalls . Drinks and food available as well.",
          "It's a really nice atmosphere, but ver very busy",
          "I loved this place but I'm a bit of a hippy at heart anyway. Not my mother's thing and my eldest son done nothing but moan \ud83d\ude02 but if you into different stuff then I'd highly recommend it. Colourful throws, t shirts from 60s bands and v \u2026",
          "Well, this was just a short walk from our hotel and it seemed to be the important thing to do if we were stopping in Es Canar, so we went for a nosey.  It was OK, however lots of the same  things, wind chimes, joss sticks and holders, tye \u2026",
          "We'd a great time wandering around the busy market.. some stuff the same but you can find good gems there too. Would recommend, but be prepared for it to get crowded in some areas.",

          "Good, but lots of repeated stalls. Very busy.",

          "If you like the same over and over again?\nThen this is for you.",
          "We stayed in EsCanar so only a walking distance from our hotel. Enjoyed the vibe and they had some lovely hand made goods. Some of them are very talented and all are friendly.",
          "Variety of items, lots to see. No alcoholic drinks were served and it was so busy almost claustrophobic",
          "Nice atmosphere great to spend a few hours. Some real nice genuine handmade products. But also a lot of 'china-import' that can be missed.",
          "Don't normally like \"shopping\" but really liked this",
          "Really cool stuff plus live music",
          "Lived it. Great love entertainment. Did shopping",
          "It was closed.. nothing happening.. even though on the internet said it was open.. thought they would update their information about summer and winter opening times..",

          "Cool place with live dj and bongos\ud83d\udd25",

          "Huge marketplace offering all manner of clothes, accessories and souvenirs. A bunch of great food and beverage outlets also. All sitting under a canopy of trees to keep you cool. Well worth a trip.",

          "Lovely atmosphere! Variety of tents and items for sale. Prices were a bit high... But it was still overall a fun experience! Live music and food were great!",
          "Very nice not to busy but much of a muchness",
          "Alot of hype, more suited to women. there isn't alot for the guys I must say. Also it's super easy to haggle here showing it's quite overpriced, but it has a really nice atmosphere and you can go though it in an afternoon. I got some great minerals to add to my collection and they have amazing beer.",

          "Very cool, but very busy. Can get lost hours wondering round all the stalls selling all sorts. Great place to buy quirky souvenirs that are not the usual tat.",
          "I guess when visiting Ibiza you must do at least one hippy market, and then you're done. Lots of homemade crafts of varying quality. Crowded during the season.",

          "Terrible. It's a tourist trap, don't go. Seriously, don't.  Way to busy. Market stalls are ok but not special. Food is awfull and overpriced. \nThere are better things to do in Ibiza. So do yourself a favour and don't go.",

          "Really enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the market. Plenty to browse around the stall holders are all friendly and happy to talk. Variety of different live music, overall well worth the short boat and walk from Calla llonga, all signposted from the small harbour to market. Which is around a 5 minute easy walk away.",

          "Love this market",
          "A great ace to purchase gifts at a look cost. Support the local natives of the island. Pricing is great and great fashion.",

          "Very interesting, very busy\nVery few Genuine Hippies",

          "It's just tat, and the occasional smell of weed.",
          "Great market showing a lot of interesting stalls. There's some repetition and not many food stalls or local produce. It's mainly clothing & jewellery but well worth a visit. Well worth visiting in the morning as it can get very busy in the afternoon",
          "Make sure to go on a Wednesday where it's not as hot as the Sahara Desert. Lovely stuff, cheap; and the atmosphere is completely friendly, apart from the Cannabis Plants and lollies. Crafts are available to do, and food is accessible. Hope you have a nice time if you take a visit :)",
          "Felt if the overall area was bigger this would have been more enjoyable. The stalls and band stands were lovely. But too many people crammed in a small space meant people were pushing and shoving and rolling pushchairs over your feet! \u2026",
          "Very busy and parking wasn't very good, lots of stalls but packed in tight, large range of clothing, jewelry, gifts, leather goods and arts and crafts, coffee and food was reasonably priced, takes a couple of hours to see it all",

          "Brilliant market its there every Wednesday. Just on the outsife of Es Cana which is a lovely place in itself. Well worth a visit.",
          "Bustling vibrant and fun. Well worth a visit even if just to people watch.",
          "Picturesque and lovely to venture around.",
          "Disappointing at best. Much of the same old rubbish to be found in the often cheaper souvenir shops. Very commercial as it\u2019s run by the AzuLine hotels group and is located in the grounds of one of their hotels.",
          "Fantastic place where you just have to go for the experience.  Its like anywhere -  you get the odd pushy sales person but the majority of the sellers  are very chilled and happy to help you (without the hard sell). Second visit here and it \u2026",
          "A big and busy market but once you have seen the first section the rest is all the same. Nothing there that stands out that you won't find anywhere else and probably cheaper. Quite disappointed.",

          "Always a great day at the hippy market.",
          "Terrible experience here, too busy for the size. Lots of old people stopping in the middle of the walkway on a slow go. Very claustrophobicy.\nPeople smoking without a care for others having to breathe there fumes in this enclosed area.\nLots of tack for sale, ie dream catchers, gnomes, josticks, stones, shells etc.",
          "A must do amazing day walking around buying gifts",
          "It's one of those places you have to visit if your in Es Cana or anywhere in Ibiza, it's a total maze of stalls with the smells of incense sticks & hash & weed with lots of colourful vendors to boot! Most items can be brought elsewhere for less but hay have a look! U'll either love it or hate it but be sure to visit!",
          "Very busy but gone expensive but still the old hippy experience",

          "Great vibe fantastic stalls little expensive but a must do wen on hols loved it very shangrilar",

          "Well worth a visit....loved it!",
          "Too much homemade rubbish",
          "Nice hippy market with kids area. Be sure to bring cash. Close to lovely beaches so combine! Tattoos do not last 10 days hahaha",
          "When you are in Ibiza its one of the things you have to see. You always buy something there. You can park close to the market \u20ac4. But its a very bussy market.",
          "Music was great, a regular market feel",
          "Very hot but good",
          "Happy amazing chilled market with unique gifts you won't find anywhere else.",
          "Nice place to visit if you like hand made jewellery and a variety of clothes. Worth a trip. Don't have high expectations",
          "A must visit if you visit Ibiza. Don't expect too much as most stuff is kind of useless or made in China. But you probably will find a souvenir. Take care of pickpockets. ",
          "Excellent hippy vibe - chilled but a tad busy. Personally I would recommend the market in Puerto Pollensa Mallorca",
          "Good prices! Just perfect place to shopping!",
          "Nothing I haven't seen before",
          "Loved it but was on an excurtion so didn't have enough time there.\ud83d\ude15",
          "Good place to hang out",
          "The hippy market was huge, I can't believe there is such a big hippy following in Ibiza, there was enough incense to choke a dead donkey!\nIf you like tie dye and carved wood then you're well in luck, it takes about an hour or so to walk around, there's some nice food on offer and some cool t shirts.\nWorth a visit.",
          "Just another tourist market. Nothing crazy, especially if you are from Berlin.",
          "Not verry hippy, I would say too commercial. You don't miss anything by not going there.",
          "Great place for shopping for souvenirs, local artists, crafts, music and food! Def check it out when you are in Ibiza!",
          "Definitely bigger than the Las dalias hippy market but infinitely more commercial. Lots more sunglasses and cheap tat for sale. Too busy and very hot. A bit disappointing.",
          "Quirky and fun.",
          "Just like any other market nothing special",
          "Really good to visit lots of lovely things to buy",
          "Ok",
          "Its like a flea Market, but a lot of the items are hand crafted, so they can be a bit pricey or sometimes dirt cheap. its hit or miss. Great atmosphere tho, with a lot of variety. Avoid on a really hot day, not much shade. ",
          "Great day out with lots of handmade items - clothes, jewelry and ornaments! \nVery very busy wouldn\u2019t recommend taking small children in push-chairs!",
          "A very authentic hippy market.",
          "This may have been a hippy market several years ago now it is just a very big market with a few hippy type stalls",
          "If you don't mind crowds and tricky parking, this is a great place to buy some hippy style tat, or simple soak up some market trading with a laid back atmosphere. Do bring water though, as  it can get pretty hot!",
          "Very enjoyable lots to see and  buy",
          "Lovely place but unfortunately is overcrowded. We would therefore recommend visiting early in the day as we were there around 11am and it was very busy.",
          "Lovely place for window shopping",
          "A great day out. Plenty of fantastic  stalls to buy lots of gifts. Live music was good.",
          "\ud83d\ude09",
          "Not worth the time and effort. Cheap junk with high prices.",
          "Very crowded and has become very commercialised",
          "Nothing special, just like most other out door markets here. Prices a bit on the high side. Prefer the out door market in the centre of Santa Eulalia.",
          "Very busy very difficult to look around properly but very nice from what I could see",
          "What's not too love",
          "Didn't see anything hippy about it. Bring drinks and food as we couldn't figure out when the restaurant was actually open. Stalls repetitive, stall holders unfriendly.",
          "Colourful, friendly and open place to explore and maybe buy something. A bit crowded sometimes though.",
          "Absolutely amazing place! Must visit destination in Ibiza.",
          "A must see. So so good.",
          "One of the biggest hippy markets on the island. Lots of variety and also a bit more interesting for men. A bit over crowded in my opinion and less photogenic. Don't go there in a wheelchair or with a stroller. ",
          "Lots of Arty stuff but too crowded.",
          "Great place to see one off trinkets and hand made stuff",
          "Never changed, great sights, sounds and smells. Lots of interesting crafts and handmade goods. Love it",
          "Wish I could have spent more time here looking at all the goods for sale.  Very busy and hard to move at timed",
          "Great vibes",
          "Liked the punta arabi even more then Dalias because at Punta Arabi theres also some (low budget) handmade art.",
          "Great market. Lovely gifts very hot.",
          "This market is typically a women's thing. A lot of commercial stalls that all look alike. Loads of tourists strolling around for a good bargain. Be prepared to stand in line if you want to eat something or go to the toilets. Parking costs 4 euro.",
          "Nice people nice prices but very very busy",
          "To many trying to rob u bags and pockets",

          "THE VARIETY OF STALLS",
          "Worth a look.",

          "Sooo expensive!! Great atmosphere and a very busy market",
          "This is no more a Hippy market than I am a rocket scientist it's living on past roots it's just A Market like every other market with overpriced junk",
          "All those stretch shops in one place if you like that sort of thing. Covered bar area was cool with live acts",
          "Lovely place",
          "Not quite my thing but I can see the attraction",
          "It was well worth a visit. Nice atmosphere although a bit busy I guess that can't be helped",
          "Great vibe, amazing artists",
          "Worth a visit",
          "Well worth a visit when in Ibiza although if you're in San Antoni I recommend getting there by bus as the ferry took 4 hours!! ",

          "Great place",
          "Great place. Very crowded :-(",
          "It's about 40 years out of date but still good if you are looking for cheep jewellery t shirts and general brick a brack but not very useful for much else",
          "Eexxppeennssiiiivveeeee!!!!! Unbelievably expensive!!! Crowded! The \"silver\" jewelry is not silver, \"gold\" is not gold.. but don't miss it if you are on Ibiza. Parking is 4 euros for all day.",

          "Good place, but in general to much people, really to much.",
          "Mostly the same thing (necklaces, clothes etc.) But nice to walk around just after opening when it's not so crowded.",
          "Fantastic place, lots of stalls, and stalls that had recycled materials and made creative crafts with them, lovely chilled atmosphere",
          "Wow, so lovely to be here and spend a few hours surfing through the market.",
          "It's a big market to give tourists another way to spend money. 4 Euro parking is taking the mickey but presumably the owners have found they can get away with it and will keep doing so.",
          "Very busy, lots of the same thing. Good to see some handmade products. Lots of dope!! \ud83d\ude04",
          "Great market with loads of stalls. Some very interesting items made by the stall owners themselves.",
          "Interesting place with live music and a mix of stalls selling craft items to the usual tourist stuff well worth the experiance",
          "I like the music especially the piano though it gers crowded and is expensive",

          "It took me back to  when  I was in my teens and early 20s  loved it. ",
          "Nice, sadly not much to sit down and have some snacks and drinks",
          "I guess if you intend to visit a hippie market your expectations will be met here. Fully crowded, countless offers for clothes, bags, selfmade things but also some 'good old' made in china ware. I missed the part where I can take a rest. Restaurants are also available but could be overfilled.",
          "A bit samey stalls but ok for a morning or afternoon stroll",
          "Thought it would be a bit less commercial but still nice and enjoyable",
          "How can you not??!",
          "Loved the vibe",

          "Not as wild as Anjuna flea market in Goa, mostly tut, but the band and bar were cool, enjoyable excursion.",
          "I would recommend going to this market as it is quite a big market with many stalls. My main criticism is that it is very crowded and the stalls are very much the same. Over all i would say its worth a look.",
          "Full of market stalls with too similar ladies clothes and jewellery.  Some interesting leather goods and nic nacks. Not really my cup of tea. ",

          "A good alternative to Las Dalias, but gets very busy so be warned! Worth a visit though.",
          "Awesome. Almost no cheap Chinese merchendise, a big plus. Great relaxed atmosphere.",
          "Music the only positive but rest overrated commercial affair. Dare I say it: tourist trap for females. Can be very budy even crowded. Much of the same: pricey poor quality clothing. Shame really.",
          "It's a lively place but full of tat. Best to be avoided unless you like tat.",
          "A very large outdoor crafts market. If you like that type of thing make sure you give a few hours if you just wanna browse past an hour is enough",
          "Very busy with tourists in August (including me). Live music was very good. Food, drinks and ice lollies are way over priced\nSome unique clothing and jewellery available but nearly everything else can be bought anywhere on Ibiza from looky \u2026",

          "Suuuuper crowded and extremely hot!! They all sell similar things so not really a must see in Ibiza",

          "You know you are going to hate the hustle and bustle but you've got to go haven't you.",
          "Why should you read these reviews? If you are on Ibiza, you go to the hippy market for sure! I did and i liked it!",
          "a lot of people selling the same stuff but worth a visit if you staying near by",
          "Great handicrafts prices to suit all tastes plus music dancing food and drinks and more",
          "We loved it   So much to look at. Lovely things to buy but you need to keep your hand on your purse/wallet and phone as it\u2019s apparently prone to pickpockets",
          "OK for a visit, all stalls are the same - lots of kaftans, incense and bags for sale, very crowded and would get very hot. Avoid if you dont like crowds, overpriced goods or are claustraphobic..... Take water!!!",

          "It's absolutely rammed",

        "wiki": "Ibiza (Spanish: [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]; Catalan: Eivissa [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]; see below) is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\nIbiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe official Catalan name is Eivissa (locally [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]). Its name in Spanish is Ibiza (pronounced [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]). In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish ( eye-BEE-th\u0259, ih-), whereas in American English the pronunciation is closer to Latin American Spanish ( ib-EE-z\u0259,  ee-BEE-s\u0259, and so forth).\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (Phoenician: \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0c, \u02beB\u0160M, \"Dedicated to Bes\"). It was later known to Romans as Ebusus. The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityo\u00fbssai (\u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"Pine-Covered Islands\").In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum), and wool.\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Moors in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of D\u00e9nia\u2014the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community\u2014and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia during some time (11th century).\nIbiza together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon, and Alc\u00e1cer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.The island was conquered by Aragonese King James I in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities.\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. At \"God's Finger\" in the Benirr\u00e0s Bay there are some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost six times smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the \"Pitiusas\" or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\n\n== Administration ==\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Majorca.  Ibiza comprises five of the community's 67 municipalities. Clockwise from the south coast, these are:\n\nSant Josep de sa Talaia (Spanish: San Jos\u00e9)\nSant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio Abad)\nSant Joan de Labritja (San Juan Bautista)\nSanta Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo)\nVila d'Eivissa (\"Ibiza Town\"; known simply as Vila, \"Town\")At the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated 147,914 by the start of 2019, and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nIbiza has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering on a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), while the average low is 14.3 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and very dry, with few rainy days, often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.7 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F), while the average low is 8.1 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.3 \u00b0C (87 \u00b0F), while the low is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 \u00b0C (67 \u00b0F) and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe typical folkloric dance of Ibiza is Ball Pag\u00e8s. The origin of these dances is unknown. Nowadays, this tradition is in the process of recovery, thanks to the efforts of different Colles of Ball Pages of the islands.\nThe clothing of the dancers is very colorful. The speed of the dance can be slow, medium or fast, although Sa Llarga, is the most danced way, and it's fast, dynamic and energetic, where the male dancer jumps around the woman and lifts up his legs.\n\n\n== People ==\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2019 had reached 147,914. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears \u2013 IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch, in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the expatriate population (Rozenberg 1990).\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francol\u00ed was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: English punk musician John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious), the psychedelic rock band Philiac, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving, and film director/actor Orson Welles.\n\n\n== Language ==\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, like English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore and Sant Antoni to the West.\nNight life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Privilege (formerly Ku), Amnesia and Es Parad\u00eds. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music.  The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy, and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\nThe season traditionally begins at the end of May, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza\u2019s clubs over the course of a three week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three day conference which has taken place on the island every year since 2008.\nClosing Parties signal the end of the clubbing season, taking place at the end of September and into the first two weeks of October. Nearly all of Ibiza's clubs remain shut during the winter until reopening the following summer.\nA typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and \"disco sunrises\". Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehavior from young adult tourists, it has acquired the sobriquet \"Gomorrah of the Med\". Also well known is Caf\u00e9 del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by Jos\u00e9 Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers, such as Patrick Topping, Carl Cox, Green Velvet, Jozeff and many more international artists.\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIbiza has been featured in the racing game Test Drive Unlimited 2, in which the player can drive around the entire island. The game also features the island of Oahu (Hawaii's third-largest island).\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley, Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel, A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank, They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene, and The Python Project by Victor Canning. Memes Eivissencs also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone. in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast.\"Because of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots.  A monument (\"The Egg\") erected in honour of Christopher Columbus can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Llu\u00eds Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andr\u00e8s has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).  In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\" which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.Ibiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect in 1 July 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi) not much more tourism can be supported.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Majorca, D\u00e9nia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eul\u00e0ria, and Figueretes\u2013Platja d'en Bossa.Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town\u2014every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eul\u00e0ria.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nIbiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as flaons. Other savory dishes include sofrit pag\u00e8s, bullit de peix (fish stew), arr\u00f2s de matan\u00e7a (rice with pork) and arr\u00f2s a la marinera.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHead, Barclay;  et al.

        "wiki": "Ibiza (Spanish: [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]; Catalan: Eivissa [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]; see below) is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\nIbiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe official Catalan name is Eivissa (locally [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]). Its name in Spanish is Ibiza (pronounced [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]). In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish ( eye-BEE-th\u0259, ih-), whereas in American English the pronunciation is closer to Latin American Spanish ( ib-EE-z\u0259,  ee-BEE-s\u0259, and so forth).\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (Phoenician: \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0c, \u02beB\u0160M, \"Dedicated to Bes\"). It was later known to Romans as Ebusus. The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityo\u00fbssai (\u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"Pine-Covered Islands\").In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum), and wool.\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Moors in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of D\u00e9nia\u2014the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community\u2014and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia during some time (11th century).\nIbiza together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon, and Alc\u00e1cer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.The island was conquered by Aragonese King James I in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities.\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. At \"God's Finger\" in the Benirr\u00e0s Bay there are some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost six times smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the \"Pitiusas\" or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\n\n== Administration ==\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Majorca.  Ibiza comprises five of the community's 67 municipalities. Clockwise from the south coast, these are:\n\nSant Josep de sa Talaia (Spanish: San Jos\u00e9)\nSant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio Abad)\nSant Joan de Labritja (San Juan Bautista)\nSanta Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo)\nVila d'Eivissa (\"Ibiza Town\"; known simply as Vila, \"Town\")At the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated 147,914 by the start of 2019, and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nIbiza has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering on a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), while the average low is 14.3 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and very dry, with few rainy days, often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.7 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F), while the average low is 8.1 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.3 \u00b0C (87 \u00b0F), while the low is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 \u00b0C (67 \u00b0F) and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe typical folkloric dance of Ibiza is Ball Pag\u00e8s. The origin of these dances is unknown. Nowadays, this tradition is in the process of recovery, thanks to the efforts of different Colles of Ball Pages of the islands.\nThe clothing of the dancers is very colorful. The speed of the dance can be slow, medium or fast, although Sa Llarga, is the most danced way, and it's fast, dynamic and energetic, where the male dancer jumps around the woman and lifts up his legs.\n\n\n== People ==\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2019 had reached 147,914. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears \u2013 IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch, in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the expatriate population (Rozenberg 1990).\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francol\u00ed was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: English punk musician John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious), the psychedelic rock band Philiac, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving, and film director/actor Orson Welles.\n\n\n== Language ==\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, like English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore and Sant Antoni to the West.\nNight life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Privilege (formerly Ku), Amnesia and Es Parad\u00eds. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music.  The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy, and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\nThe season traditionally begins at the end of May, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza\u2019s clubs over the course of a three week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three day conference which has taken place on the island every year since 2008.\nClosing Parties signal the end of the clubbing season, taking place at the end of September and into the first two weeks of October. Nearly all of Ibiza's clubs remain shut during the winter until reopening the following summer.\nA typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and \"disco sunrises\". Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehavior from young adult tourists, it has acquired the sobriquet \"Gomorrah of the Med\". Also well known is Caf\u00e9 del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by Jos\u00e9 Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers, such as Patrick Topping, Carl Cox, Green Velvet, Jozeff and many more international artists.\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIbiza has been featured in the racing game Test Drive Unlimited 2, in which the player can drive around the entire island. The game also features the island of Oahu (Hawaii's third-largest island).\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley, Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel, A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank, They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene, and The Python Project by Victor Canning. Memes Eivissencs also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone. in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast.\"Because of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots.  A monument (\"The Egg\") erected in honour of Christopher Columbus can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Llu\u00eds Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andr\u00e8s has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).  In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\" which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.Ibiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect in 1 July 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi) not much more tourism can be supported.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Majorca, D\u00e9nia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eul\u00e0ria, and Figueretes\u2013Platja d'en Bossa.Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town\u2014every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eul\u00e0ria.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nIbiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as flaons. Other savory dishes include sofrit pag\u00e8s, bullit de peix (fish stew), arr\u00f2s de matan\u00e7a (rice with pork) and arr\u00f2s a la marinera.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHead, Barclay;  et al.

          "This is a very popular beach, with all sorts of people trying to grab their spot. The water is nice, clear and shallow and great to splash about in. There is an abandoned sailing boat on its side, very close in shore. You can easily walk out to it, but if you get too close",
          "The beach itself is nice. Sandy, with clear waters. Note that there is a paid parking space (currently \u20ac6/day). The most annoying part is the number and the stubbornness of the salesmen. They are way too many and they won\u2019t go away unless you explicitly state that you don\u2019t",
          "Warm clear water, pines around, many people but you can always find place. You can swim with fish. There is pirat tower close to that beach.",
          "Too many people to start with! Then on top of it there are just as many people trying to sell you food and drinks. The police really need to clamp down on this illegal activity!",
          "David Morales - Needin You video was recorded on this beach. Cool vibe and a lot of things to do on this beach =D",
          "I do like Salinas, it\u2019s a very pretty beach with nice water and there are not usually any jellyfish but it does seem to be getting smaller every year. It is great out of season but just too busy in peak season. 6 euros to park although there is shade by the jockey club end.",
          "It`s very dofficult to select a beach to make your day in Ibiza, as all of them are really amazing! But, my heart will always be for Salinas! The cristal waters, the soft sand, the chill and cool beach bars is the best place to make friends, to enjoy swimming, water sports or",
          "Nice and large beach in particular for Families. Served with good bars/restaurants, you have to pay to access to the area.",
          "Ses Salines is one of my favourite beaches around. It is long and wide, you can always find a place in July and August it is waaay overcrowded. Otherwise the sand is nice, waters are clear and calm and you can enjoy the sun rays until late.",
          "Jockey Club for lunch, Sa Trinxa for late afternoon vibes, woodland paths, if you don\u2019t visit Salines have you even been to Ibiza? Love this beach so much. Can be a bit seaweedy in places.",
          "Nice beach, pleasant beachside bars. One problem - man taking photos of young children. Chased away but watch out. Great sunset",
          "We go here every year. Be early sobyiubcan have a beach bed at one of the restaurants. Sea is very clean and azur blue, sandy beach.",
          "Worth the visit but now very busy and nothing like it was 20 years ago . Fun watching the girls selling fancy kaftans up and down the beach like a catwalk show.",
          "If you are in Ibiza I recommend visiting this beach as it\u2019s more protected from the wind and the water is crystal clear! There is a massive parking but make sure you take money as they don\u2019t take card. The price is 6 euros whatever the time you stay!",
          "I recommend you this place if you want to relax and listen to good music , veeeery nice experience . Promise next time I\u2019ll be back here . A bit far away from the city and there it\u2019s no taxi",
          "A brilliant beach that can get busy with 2 very nice beach cafes/ restaurants. The are pricy but great for chilling and people watching. The swimming is fantastic and shallow. Topless and nude. Great for families. Interesting to see the salt flats on the way. 15 mins from",
          "I firsr went to this beach 13 years ago on recommendation of a friend. The clear shallow water always stuck with me so when i returned to ibiza i had to return to this beach. A taxi from playa den bossa takes about 10-15mins and costs about 10-15\u20ac. The single beds cost 10\u20ac",
          "Amazing beautiful place the sea is beautiful you can swim with little fish....many different services, food, drinks, massages, cocktails, perfect for couples Enjoy :-)",
          "There are many beach bars in this area, all of which come together to create a cool and funky vibe, especially as the strong midday sun gives way to the cooler afternoon sun. However, we tend to walk a little bit further along the coastline and make camp at one of the many",
          "Beach at Playa \u2018d\u2019en Bossa wasn\u2019t that nice so we asked cab driver where best to go and not too far. He suggested Salines Beach and we really enjoyed it as lovely sand and pretty water and attractive bay. Some of the restaurants are really expensive so take a picnic or go up to",
          "A stunning beach with water of aquamarine hues. We got the bus here from Ibiza town and then rented sun loungers as it was our last day and some shade was needed. The hawkers and promoters are too frequent and get annoying when you just want to listen to the waves lapping. Bring",
          "Nice beach, not too far, but the sea was a little dirty and the beach very crowded, but it is well organized",
          "The best place to spend a day on Ibiza with nice vibe and peopel..good food and sangria and music...clean water and just perfect...",
          "This beach is nice but filled with tourist, very crowded. The is not much around except close to the airport, water and salt.",
          "Good selection of beach vendors selling everything from beer to Acai bowls. The few beach restaurants are expensive but the one by the hostel is great",
          "Its very nice, turcoice water and clear. Gets VERY crowded, and the restaurant (B) we tried for lunch were overly (extremely) pricy. Not to long outside of Ibiza town, 10 min cabride.",
          "I went to have a look as is my way. I walked along the beach and over to the tower then across Es Cavallet. Salinas has a great party vibe and would have been amazing in my 20s but alas they are no more and I probably looked like a creepy old 40 year old wandering through the",
          "It is an ordinary beach with nothing special, if you just wanna visit a beach to chill and enjoy the water it is alright but if you are looking for a nice view or beautiful nature or anything special it is not the place for it",
          "One of the best beaches in the Island. Go soon, grab a balinese bed for 60 eur. and stay all day. Eat at Joquey Club. Unforgetable.",
          "Spent a lovely day ashore at this beach while visiting Ibiza on a cruise. Good thing we researched in advance - managed to jump in a taxi and be whisked here from the port in about 15 minutes for 18 euros. Arriving at about 10.30am the beach was already filling up - lovely curve",
          "We recently spent just one day in Ibiza and decided to spend most of our time at Ses Salines. What a great decision this was. This 'playa' has it all. There are plenty of chair and umbrella rentals available, three very nice beach bars/restaurants, clean bathroom facilities,",
          "Just a 20-minute bus ride out of Ibiza Town and you have this wonderful stretch of sandy beach and translucent sea. Every amenity is handy-by with reasonably-priced restaurants for a spot of lunch, especially Can Masia which is just where the bus stops and served me a gorgeous",
          "Beach clubs, family restaurants, nude sunbathing areas, sandy beaches, hidden coves, snorkelling zones and kayaks available - has it all here... if you don't mind the exorbitant car park charges..",
          "uhhhh yeah mare ok...tanto rumore...tanta gente...but that's Ibiza,per\u00f2 sempre fighissima playa...sempre ok",
          "It\u2019s a very long beach and super busy. It\u2019s get quieter the further you go down. The water is beautiful and clear and great for scuba diving or just cooling off. The beach beds offered by the restaurants aren\u2019t cheap but worthwhile if you want some shade. The food itself in the",
          "Salinas is not the quietest or the most beautiful beach in the island, but its certainly the best depiction of the island's spirit. You've got legendary Sa Trinxa, more hippy and nude, middle of the road Jockey Club, traditional Malibu and newcomer Beso Beach. A lot of beautiful",
          "We stopped here when our cruise ship pulled into Ibiza. Salines beach is pretty, clean and had a great vibe. We arrived early to meet a sailboat for a day of sailing. The beach was empty, but clean. The water was clear, some sea growth at the shore -but nothing terrible. We",
          "One of the bigger beaches of the island. Not a Cala.. 4 beach clubs take care of the audience, which is from all kinds of backgrounds. Great parking facility",
          "This is a beautiful sandy beach. Definitely advise arriving early as it got very busy. Cafe is expensive so bring your own water and drinks!",
          "Visited this beach and loved it. Many naturists but plenty of room for everyone. There is a fee paying car park, but we drove past towards the restaurant and managed to find a space each time so avoided paying anything.",
          "With restaurants close by and the option of large loungers this is a good place to soak up some sun. There are better beaches around but this one has the beach vibes!",
          "It's one of the most beautiful beaches in Eivissa because the environment has been protected and preserved. The way to get there is also nice with all the salt pits and the flamingos.",
          "We explored the commercial salt pits at Ses Salinas near Ibiza Town before visiting the popular local beach with its restaurant and bar. This was a good start to our tour of Southern Ibiza.",
          "Perfect place for a swim.. very clean and clear beach.. may get a lil crowded but you will still find place. Very easy accessible from the city with a direct bus.. Enjoy the sunset.",
          "Classic Miami Beach on the island. Avoid it in summer because you will not find a spot available. Very recommended in winter.",
          "We visited in October Park at roundabout to avoid parking charge and walk to beach Didn\u2019t hire loungers we did it the old fashioned way ... towels on the sand :) Stayed for 2 hours nice and nice outlook",
          "salinas is a great place. it is a very nice place to be. the sea is normally of excellent quality. and the sand of the beach strand a great walk.",
          "We stayed on this beach following lunch in one of the restaurants. It was wonderful fun for a group of girls, we were able to buy mojitos, beach dresses & jewellery......",
          "The bus goes every half an hour to Ses Salines from Ibiza town and costs 2.90 euros per person. You pass flamingos grazing(?) in the shallow lakes of the area then come to the stunning beaches. rugged walking takes one to rocky coves or you can cross the peninsular to the other",
          "This is a relatively famous beach so it often gets packed. There are several big restaurants that have lounge chairs to rent with food and drink service which is what I did. You can also just go and get a spot in the sand without having to pay. This is a relatively sandy beach",
          "Not be missed. A long beautiful beach with impressive turquoise waters. It's really crowded so make sure you come early. There are many nice beach bars to have a drink but all of them are quite pricey.",
          "For me this is among the top 3 beaches in Eivissa. Great atmosphere and Cristal clear water. The only down side is the amount of people selling things in the beach and the amount of clubs taking part of the sand.",
          "It looked like everyone in Ibiza was on this beach on that afternoon we were there. It's nice, long and nice to swim, but far too busy for our liking. There was no shower where we were staying.",
          "Wish I would've relaxed here all 3 days I was in Ibiza. The beach was absolutely beautiful. The water was crystal clear, perfectly clean, and warm. The beach wasn't too crowded either. There's lots of cute shops and restaurants around. It's very much a beach town. Would",
          "We went to Sa trinxa bar near the jockey club. Cool atmosphere great music. Fab beach party vibe. More toilets needed though as you had to wait a while.",
          "Very beautiful beach with white sand and blue waters. Overcrowded in August in anytime. They offer chairs with umbrella to rent for \u20ac50 but you have to get there before 9 to get one. Full of ladies doing topless there. Nice vibe easy to park if you get early. Wonderful views",
          "Love this beach. Plenty of parking. Comfy sun loungers. Great choice of bars for drinks or lunch. The sand is soft and clean and there's a gentle slope into the calm, clear, warm water. Lots of activity to watch, girls modelling clothing, sellers of food and drink, watches,",
          "The one and only top Ibiza beach. Ibiza has a lot of good beaches but this one is the BEST! It's located in a natural park, but the access is great. You have to pay 6 Euros for parking but it has shadows and it very close to the beach. You should go early in the morning (9h/10h)",
          "The place is really beautiful, I would say wild with a really big area where you can go for a walking and explore the nature. The water is clean. There are Beach bar and they organize parties. Ps. There are some rocks in the water but it's safe Beach you will enjoy it!",
          "This place is the best for people watching, you will not get bored. Good range of dining options, sun beds are pricey at \u20ac40 per couple! But it is Ibiza! Nice enough beach and calm shallow waters, safe for kids.",
          "Over the past ten years we have sailed and visited almost every beach in the Balearic Islands. We visit Salines at least once a year mainly to eat at the Jockey Club and the excellent mooring buoys in the bay. It has progressively deteriorated, but this year was particularly",
          "A-mazing beach. Yes, it's busy, but boy is the water gorgeous. Not so much weed and no jelly fish. Great for people watching and the music.",
          "It's perfect for teenagers. Lots of girls and boys with the bracelets which are discounts for the clubs pass for this beach every day, in particular in Satrincha, a beach for younger. The sea was very good",
          "Best and safest beach for young children as its very shallow for quite a way out so it enables you to keep an eye on them better. Not as crowded as last year but that was a month later The locals use this beach so it must be good. Good little selection of restaurants and water",
          "Gorgeous beach with a nice and relaxed atmosphere! We had a blast and enjoyed the great music. There is parking available, and various restaurants along the beach. We had lunch at the Jockey Club Salinas, nice food and drinks, a little pricey. Friendly for kids too.",
          "We were excited to see this highly recommended beach. We arrived at around 3pm and it was a seen out of an over-crowded, cheap, English holiday resort. Crammed, back to back with bodies and Horrible multi coloured umbrellas that seemed to overlap. The sand and water wasn't",
          "Beautiful beach in Ibiza but overcrowded during the summer season. Also plenty of boats. Have to go there at the end of the day.",
          "Ses Salines is a pretty beach, but far too crowded. If there was like some 20% of the usual crowd would be just right. Because of so many people, there is also too many cars and scooters parked just steps from the beach. Actually one does not miss much if he just chooses to",
          "very crowdy, hardly no shadow, good connection by bus to/from town, the salt pools/ salinas in combination with dunes are remarkable",
          "Loungers weren't cheap but they were comfy with a nice thick mattress. Loads to watch. Lots going on. Beach sellers everywhere which made for a really interesting day. Loved it.",
          "The sea is not as clear as I was expecting however we have got so much fun looking at all these young people moving their bodies at every single beat that could hear there. The famous Ibiza animations are all there and sweating for you to invite to the party. Luckily the \"Sa",
          "Well worth a visit although 40 euros for two sunbeds and a umbrella is expensive on top of 5 euros to park in the car park, we were aware of this before our visit. Two or three restaurants so plenty of choice, club parades and beach vendors are there all day. It gets busy but",
          "We were here to spend our day at the beach. It is a very busy beach with a lot of sellers of all kind of goods: sunglasses, sandwiches, towels etc. Every 20 seconds they come walking by and sandblast you. Not really my kind of beach... At the end of the afternoon there were",
          "It is nice to visit but to crowded for me and over-rated especially in summer time too much people. To rent a bed can be 60 euro! You can take bus 11 which is leaving each 30 minutes. The bus from Ses Figueretas costs 2,95 euro so a very good price(one way ticket). So I",
          "The ibiza salt plains are worth a visit. Extraordinary landscape. A variety of ibizan salt products can be bought too",
          "Our family of five really enjoyed our time at Salines Beach. It's gorgeous, full of local people with plenty of characters. The surf does not come in hard and you can go out 100 meters and have it only be above your waist. From that perspective it's really safe for kids.",
          "Visited this beach recently on a recommendation from a mate who said I had to visit the Jockey Club. It's a short cab ride from Playa Den Bossa. The Jockey Club was overflowing so I went for a short walk down the beach and stopped the Malibu Beach Club instead, which was half",
          "Quality of the beach perfect! Views perfect. Avoid \"rush hour\" as there are vendors of everything you can imagine (from hats to dresses, massages, fruit, sandwiches, cold drinks and so on) and it is a show actually but there is no quiet then.",
          "Spent nice day on beach. Clean, not too crowded. Bar for drinks, toilets, shower and music in the evening. Loungers, umbrellas available.",
          "Very nice sand beach next to the Ibiza salt mines. Beach has clear blue water and is easily accessible to go for a swim. Also a pittoresque view with the sailing and motor yachts anchored off in front of the beach. We spent the afternoon at the Jocky Club and rented a few",
          "Very nice beach area located by the salt mounds. Low Key area with a nice restaurant at the entrance. Parking is free and topd and bottoms are optional. Water was a bit cold but the time we spent there was great",
          "We discover Salinas especially Sa Trinxha many years ago and still loved our time there- great music and very entertaining people watching. There are issues with the illegal vendors selling food, drinks, bikinis and towels but it's all a part of the vibe. By far the most",
          "Beautiful sea , and landscapes, but very crowded and everything is pretty expensive around. Not as wild as I was expecting it",
          "Amzing beach wih clean water and blue water. This beach is in a protect area and keep the wildlife around the beach.",
          "One of the nicest beaches in Ibiza. Crystal clear water and white sand. Lovely long walk around the beach and salt planes- well worth it.",
          "I like this beach is one of the best for me is wonderful also you have a lot of close restaurant and parking bus ,etc . I recommend to go !!!!",
          "If there is only one beach you have the time to visit: then it must be Salinas... the essence of Ibiza... maybe non in august .... it' s packed and noisy and show off... but it's also relaxed and beautiful and friendly and special... find your spot and enjoy",
          "This was the first beach that we went to while in Ibiza, It was nice and quiet and not too busy while we were there, we did get there on a thursday. There was a lot of people trying to sell things on the beach, but overall a nice place to spend the day. Amazingly clear water.",
          "Most will see this as a lounging beach close to the airport, but it is one of the most beautiful on the island. It's part of a national park and full of interest. You can walk across the headland to the Torre de ses Portes in around 25 minutes, across a shoreline rock platform",
          "A very nice place to be. Nice bars and restaurants, nearly perfect sand on most areas and very wide space to walk along! Be early even in October hard to get a spot for parking.",
          "Wonderful and amazingly beautiful The beach offers lots of places to go. You can go to the family section, singles section, swingers section and the gay section. There are restaurants along the beach and you can hire loungers to relax. The beach is outside Ibiza town but",
          "If you come to salinas at 10.00 you will have the whole beach for you! even in the summer! in the winter take a walk through the national reserve.",
          "Lovely area but bring stacks of euro as it has an exclusive bohemian feel Fav place jockey club which has excellent food entertainment",
          "One of the best and beautiful beach in Ibiza. It gets so crowded during summertime. As we were there in June, and it was so crowded that we had to walk a bit to find a place. The view is awesome, colours of water from this beach is really beautiful.",
          "Went to this beach on the last day of our stay and it really is quite stunning . Lovely shallow sloping beach and ideal for families . Set up on the beach club nearest the jetty and got charged 20 euros a lounger - steep compared to other places and more galling when I noticed",
          "Before the tourism boom this was the major source of income for the island. With refrigeration the need for salt in preserving food was reduced.",
          "Beautiful natural beach with amazing views, clear water and soft sand. Great restaurants along the beach with amazing food and drinks and great music. Chill vibes. Full mix of people - families, couples, young and old people. Top 10 most beautiful beaches I've been to.",
          "Very close to the airport in the south of the island are the salt lakes. We visited during a car trip and parked in the large car park for the beach (6 euros). A short walk takes you to the long sweeping beach that wasn't very crowded and had superb views. Back in the car and",

          "Spent a lovely day here. Lovely beach, good parking great beach club with good food and drinks served to your uber comfy lounger. Last beach club on the right. What's not to like?",
          "Close to a known club DC-10 this beach is clean and large enough to accommodate hundreds of tourists. Also allows you for a good walk connecting the beach with a near hill (interesting experience). Try to go early and find a parking spot early and as close as you can from",
          "Full of garbage, very dirty. Seems to be more cigarettes than sand in the beach. Not good for a quiet time or for enjoying the nature.",
          "One of the best beach in Ibiza. Amazing if you go close to the rocks for the ideal privacy and for a cool and relax atmosphere. Very good for snorkeling a bit, the water is super clean and transparent. Recommended.",
          "One of the better beaches , quieter at one end and more suitable for families and more adult orientated club scene at the other. Water has always been sparkling when I have visited and we have always had a very pleasant time there. Can also recommend the small restaurants on",
          "A lovely beach with more parking than average, a couple of restaurants, small shop and very clear water. Definitely worth a visit, you can choose to go high end or not, either way its a pleasurable experience.",
          "Simply, a long beach not too far from Ibiza town. Not hugely impressed with it but it was clean with sandy beaches, lovely water, only seen 1 cafe bar area where the bus drops people off so there could be more further along the beach. Many people coming to sell cold beers or",

          "My friend and I spent five out of 7 days lazing at this beach.There were always Sunloungers available,plenty of waste bins dotted about to discard one's rubbish which,thankfully,did get used by the vast majority of sunbathers.The beach always looked clean and tidy,but,above",
          "The clearest water, soft silky sand with few beach clubs with good music. It got super crowded, with almost no place to walk. That said, I'd recommend that you get here early enough to grab one of the lounge chairs (for 25 Euro per day for an umbrella and a lounge chair),",
          "A perfect beach to spend the day. The best place to spend your day at Playa yeses Salinas is at the end of the beach, where you have a lovely chiringuito where you can have drinks and food and is full of sexy people and is a easy place to have a sun bed, in the other places you",
          "I love coming here for some reason, there is plenty of parking and plenty of room to lay out and chill. The food is excellent and the Dom always chilled. I always come here when I go to Ibiza",

          "On of the better beaches on the island from our perspective. From Sta Eularia it was about a 40 minute drive. From Ibiza town about half that. But the beach is worth the drive. Nice sand, and both a public and private part. So if you would like the comfort of a large double",
          "Loved this beach but NOT on a Sunday when it gets overcrowded and there is a fight for umbrellas ... awesome sunsets though and some drumming",

          "the famous Ses Salainas Beach in Ibiza counts to one of the most \"hip\" Beaches on Balearic Island Ibiza. To go there you need to drive trough the spectacular Salt Fields & Nature Reserve. My favorite Location is the Jockey Club, but alsao the Other Beachclubs are all nice and",

          "love this beach! we visited in late June so not peak season so wasnt super busy - great drinks, tunes and snacks at Sa Trinxa ...we loved the whole vibe here and will definately come back on our next visit! The beach it self is great and the drive into it through the salt",
          "Salinas is an infamous beach on the south of the island. Known for its lovely sand, crystal clear waters and cool beach bars. It gets very busy high season, and finding some sand to get your towels down can be tricky. There are 3 restaurants on the beach, one on the west side,",
          "A truly awesome beach and lovely clear blue seas, the sea goes out a fair way before it gets to any depth at all a truly awesome beach",
          "There are plenty of more beautiful beaches to go in Ibiza, I would not waste time going to Salines, unless you are in the island for a long time and have already seen everything else.",
          "Any beach where you can wade on your knees in pristine water whilst enjoying the best people watching you can find is the place for me. Busy in July however not too busy where its difficult to find sand or overcrowding in water. Loved this place.",
          "Just spent a relaxing day here. It was very busy and hard to find a space on the beach. It is a really pretty beach and the sea was crystal clear and really warm. There's several beach clubs along the beach with sunbeds. We arrived by taxi from Figueretes which cost \u20ac13. There",
          "I return to Salinas every year just. It's more like a \"party\" beach with a lot of people trying to sell you things and dancers promoting club nights. Every time the water is different. Once we couldn't enter because of the jellyfish, the other time it was full of seaweed and big",
          "After it is packed with party animals who scream and drink. Otherwise it is a very nice beach. Actually in winter time must be amazing, will go one day!",
          "We only visited this beach for a short time, as we had hired a boat that was taking us to Formentera, (must go there!). The setting is lovely, no hotels anywhere, just pine forest. In peak season it is far too crowded, however when we were there early morning and late evening it",
          "The beach is beautiful with white sand but can get crowded. Water is very clean and clear. Although it can be reached by taking a bus but renting a bike or car would be better.",
          "Spent an entire day and evening here, chilling to great music. Sa Trinxa bar very relaxed. Jockey bar a bit more up market",
          "I thought i was in the caribbean sea ... this is a warm beach .. the vibe in the environment is very nice, nice people and very nice landscape of course ... just u have to take this note to go there u surely shall take things with u if u dont want tonbe paying expensive",
          "Overcrowded, poor service, few sun-chairs and umbrellas, pricey. A pros? Pristine water. It is possible to get by bus L11 or taxi, little parking.",
          "I'm sure it's a great party place and that is the only draw I can see, the beach itself is ugly. I want white sand, not brown.",
          "If you want to do not want to get bored you must go to Ses Salines. At morning you can buy ibiza's clothes, at midday all disco will show you the night show offer and after they will offer you all kond of cocktails. It's really an spectacular beach. Blue water and sand. You will",
          "a lot of people (was expected) since is one of the most famous beach in ibiza. the ocean was a little bit dirty. the price of the spot is average. reccomend to go at least once",
          "We sought this place after reading some online advice, and certainly didn't regret it. Situated several kms south of the airport, past the amazing canals, I very much doubt you can get here by public transport, so everyone drives, and this shows in the clientelle who frequent",
          "I just love Salines it's a unique and beautiful spot on the island and popular with residents and tourists alike. I have been visiting here for years and always make sure I spend a day here when I'm on the island. It's a great beach for families with the long shallow beach, the",
          "Salines beach is beautiful and relatively easy to access by bus, or particularly by taxi, but it's crowded during the summer with solely noisy tourists. You have to wander a really, really long way down the beach in the blazing sun to find a reasonable spot to lay out, and the",
          "Las Salinas or Playa de Ses Salines is located in the south of Ibiza and close to both the airport and Ibiza town. It's a long stretched piece of clean sand. With many of the island's best known beach clubs such as Jockey Club\" or \"Sa Trinxa\" it is one of the places to be on an",
          "The addition of 4 beach clubs has left this beach more like that of San Antonio. Not the place to go if you want a peaceful day at the beach, however if you still want the party atmosphere in a different place that playa d'en bossa or San an, then this is the place. There are",
          "Had a very nice 5 course meal at this restaurant in an idyllic setting on the beach staff were very attentive views if the sea from every table a must on your holiday at Ses Estaques hotel.",
          "Fabulous beach with no tourist nuisances! We brought a cooler box with some alcohol and snacks. There is a small shop to purchase some from too. Had a brilliant day and we finished of at the restaurant next to the shop which put on a delicious bbq! Be sure to get there early as",
          "Great beach to relax and enjoy the sea and sand. Limited options to eat and drink. So suggest carry a picnic bag. Beach beds were offered 20 euro pp! Buses run once an hour from ibiza city so time your travel. Best travelled on a bike",
          "One of the most scenic landscapes of the island, you can walk from side to side with blue sea water aside . You can rest a bit in the two bars and restaurants along the way or go to see the \"salinas\" just some steps inward. If you like swimming pay attention to the rocks!",
          "We travelled from Playa den Bossa with a toddler and loved the beach and the jockey club! Not much more to see here but there is a great atmosphere.",
          "is a long beach with crystal water not far from Playa den bossa. It's a famous beach and It's always a bit crowded.",
          "Great Beach you do need a car or scooter to get here. The clubs do parades here which is great to see. There are a few bar/restaurants here you can eat inside or you can have waiter service on the beach. Or bring your own picnic. There is a shop on the way if you need to grab",
          "Shouldn't really review this place it will only let more people into it's secret. The best beach in the Med, but don't tell anybody or they'll all come and spoil it",
          "It is easily accessible by car or scooter, but we chose to cycle from figueretes, the ride is flat and the bike lanes are of good quaity, the scenery on the way to the beach is beautiful, you go past the salt flats with flamingos in the water. On arrival at the beach their is",
          "A truly awesome beach one of my top 3 favourite beaches in Ibiza, bit of a trek to get to and need a car to visit it ideally but would highly recommend it and well worth the trip",
          "It's April - the beach is unpopulated. The sandy beach goes on and on and I can imagine in high season this beach is packed. The sea is shallow and there is a restaurant playing Ibizan dance music. One couple had paid to use the sunbeds which I bet will be expensive but highly",
          "Lovely see views and nice beaches. Just found too few places to have a drink or bite to eat. It is also quite difficult to find - follow the signs to the airport is the best.",
          "We got here right away in the morning. With one day in Ibiza, we had the cab driver drop us off at the \"best beach\". The ocean views were absolutely breathtaking and the beach is so clean. The sand is soft and cold. We rented an umbrella which was a bit expensive but worth it",
          "With over 50 beaches to choose from in Ibiza there is literally a beach for all reasons. Salinas is one of the longest and most popular. It's the home of a number of expensive but quality beachside restaurants playing music with an Ibizan vibe. You can eat inside or pay at least",
          "there are a lot of young and beautiful people. Atmosphere is great. Sometimes too crowded, but you can always go to the rocky end of the beach where nudist hide",
          "The beach is very nice but too crouded. It's annoying that you have to sit so much close to other people there. Ibiza has many more beautiful and amazing beaches.",
          "Being so close to the airport it is not a disadvange at all. It is one of the biggest beaches on the island, that's why it is so great to just lay there with friends, all the day. Reccomended.",
          "Worth a visit. Lovely beaches. We recommend hire a car or a jeep and visit some of the amazing beaches around the island",
          "It's one of the best beaches in Ibiza, where the famouse people go, and no wonder why. Unfortunately the day we went it was full of jelly fish.",
          "We went to this beach ver very early in the morning and there was almost nobody there yet... Recommend to arrive really early in order to find parking place. Perfect location and perfect romantic moment... There are small \"calas\" just cosy for some kind of privacy. The beach is",
          "This beach will not be to everyone's taste. Busy and crowded you won't get a sunbed here unless you arrive early, and by early afternoon there is barely space to put down your towel. Not a beach for the budget concious either as parking anywhere nearby costs 5 euros, and the",
          "Kept on coming back to this side of the beach. Water was nice, beach was good, restaurants and beach clubs are equally nice. Went to other beaches across the island (for real, across the island) but this one seems to be the one that sticks the most!",
          "Nice place to visit if you enjoy beaches and if not, there are many bars and beach side cafes to sit in and eat/drink",
          "One of the longest beaches of Ibiza and perhaps one of the most popular, perhaps because near the town of Evissa. The sea is still beautiful and the sand is clear.",
          "If you are on the island and don't want to pay to go to a beach party - then visit Salines. South facing sandy beach with swimming area buoyed off, maybe 4 beach bar / restaurants, all with double sun beds / shades. Lots of beautiful young (and some not so young) bodies.",
          "I have been there so many times and I just love coming back. Many people say that it is too long or alway overcrowded, I say nonsense. I can always find a spot where nobody bothers me and enjoy the sun",
          "Gorgeous beach, Shallow rocky (very warm) sea water for first 10 meters, & as the rocks clear, the sea quickly deepens.( 5 meters beyond) - Great beach for people watching, plus many people selling different things. from beach throws to bikini's, sunglasses to bracelet &",
          "Near Ibiza city, is a sandy quiet sea beach, deck chairs to rent, many people, is better to go earlier to rent umbrella and chairdesk",
          "Short drive or bus ride to a fantastic sandy beach , great for people watching whilst people recover from a night out and start getting ready for another ! Highly recommend Jockey Club for food and drink whilst sat on a big day bed (Cava Sangria is a must)",
          "Although the beach is a little rocky it has an amazing vibe and a beautiful sunset over the peninsula.",
          "We came here on a recommendation and so glad we did. Just a short drive from Ibiza town, ample parking and a wonderful beach. It has several Beach clubs where you can hire day beds and have food and drink served to you. quite a lot of the high end customers, poseurs, on view",
          "Ses salynes is my favorite beach , there is a bar at the end to the left wihich is called sa trinxa and it is fantastic , a miix of people from all over the world and the dj , jonathan, is the best of alll!!!!",
          "If you decided to go to Ibiza, you must go to Las Salinas! its the most cosmopolitan beach in the island! Go there with your best bikini. The only problem is the parking... on summer is quite imposible to go there. The restaurants are great and expensive.",
          "Super choice of beach clubs from the old days. My favorite is Sa Trinxa because of the hippie culture that still exists on some days. Not in July or august hahahaha",
          "2days ago we went with friends. We couldnt find place to stay on the sand. It was dissapointing for us. The sea was not clean too much.",
          "The beach gets very crowded as the day goes by. You will find beach beds, but they are not for free. The charge can go anywhere between 15-30 Euros depending on where on the beach you are. It is a very rocky beach and compared to some other beaches I have been to, I found to be",
          "Call me boring but I didn't like it. The thin beach on a Friday in August has a carpet of people on it. You can hardly find any sand to walk on, everyone is posing or looking at everyone else. I'm too old and I'm married to perving at the girls selling bikinis isn't the best way",
          "Las Salinas beach is a beautiful long expanse of golden sand with crystal clear water. The water is not icy cold in fact it was pleasantly warm! There are several beach restaurants about four I think all with great food and good wines. We had an Amazing time and I highly",
          "Visit the Jockey Club,great atmosphere and food, Walk the long beach to burn up the appetite, then chill after lunch on the beach,bliss",
          "Once you are in the beach, you won't feel boring. Many entertainment are there including nights clubs advertising with live shows. The beach is clean and well served with many fruits sellers and other stuff",
          "Is a FAB place to go to the beach but never ever go there on a Sunday, is too busy and you will not enjoy at all. Too many children around and you will get very annoying with people splashing sand on your towel. But if you go there in a different day, the experience is totally",
          "in our hotel we were advised this place and we were delighted. very nice place to relax.Just a bit expensive chairs and beds for lounging.",
          "Good thing Sas Salinas is a looooong beach. you can find there 4 beach restaurants pumping with music ( I'd recommend Sa Trinxa for all crazy party people :), loads of people and this festive feeling of Ibiza. If you want to feel like your holiday is not stopping party, Sas",
          "Nice beach to hang at, gets busy in peak summer though. A lot of people come and chill. Not the most beautiful beach on the island but still a lot of fun.",
          "I just love this beach. Lovely, crystal clear water, white sand, nice bars, beautiful people. Only 15 mins drive away from Ibiza town. Can't wait to be back!",
          "A much better beach to spend the day in when compared to Playa d'En Bossa and its noisy bars and eclectic crowds. Definitely the beach of choice for families and people wanting to enjoy the beauty of Ibiza, the music and the nice food. Ideal for both kids and couples outings.",
          "Playa Ses Salines is a long, light narrow sandy beach with beach bars, girls selling bikinis and beachwear, and pretty girls and boys trying to get you to go to their clubs. it's noisy, crowded but good fun. Less child-friendly than a lot of the quieter northern beaches but",
          "Located in a nice bay, playa Ses Salines has a nice view, but too many people. From the different beach clubs, my favorite is Sa Trinxa, for the music and the people there, however here too, the amount of people accepted make it just a bad experience. A pity if you visit in",
          "best beach in Ibiza.a taxi ride away but well worth it.white sandy beach and turqouise ble sea.fab beach bars and places to eat .and beautiful people.",
          "The beach per se is nice (white sand) with clear water. Do not go there if you want a calm afternoon. If you are however willing to be surrounded by people and hear the music from the restaurants then you will enjoy.",
          "Recommended by friends we arrived at 5pm with our 4 teenage kids in tow. After paying to park in the car park we walked across the dunes to Sa Trinxa and set up camp. It's busy and noisy but as the music started to play the musicians including saxophonist, violinist and guitar",
          "We especially enjoyed it at Sa Trinxa which is at the opposite end to Jockey Club. Arrive around 11am to ensure you have a sunbed for the day. The bar offers waiter service at your lounger and the music picks up in the late afternoon.",
          "Salines is a calm beach, with familys and less noise then others beaches. Clean water, no waves and white sand make this beach a nice place to relax after a nice party in Ibiza!! Great restaurants at the beach also, but expensive (60 euros) for a \"bed\".",
          "One of the longest and most famous beaches in Ibiza. It's often packed with people but since it is a very long beach there's always room for you at some part of the beach ;-) Various beach restaurants available also. Worth visiting for sure.",
          "Nice sand beach very entertaining crowd wonderful clear waters. It's a joy! So much fun to go there. Lovely bar and restaurant and very nice music all day long. Cannot think of a better fun beach anywhere in the Planet",
          "Salinas its amazing beach . From Figuretas you take bus 11 and will take you to Salinas and price is 2.90 euro one way and you are there in 20 minutes ride with good air conditioned bus x",
          "Nice white sand beach and clear water close to Ibiza Airport. You can take buses from Ibiza Town that takes about 30 minutes. Two restaurants on the beach and on just when you enter the area. Lots lots of people but very nice anyway.",
          "Lovely and hot, far too crowded, too much litter, too many beach touts. Apart from that all is fine....lol",
          "If you want to go away from the crowded beaches of Ibiza, this is the place to go. Don't need to hire a car to get here; there's a public bus that takes you here. Also there's a 15 minute hike to get to the spot but it's gorgeous. Won't be bothered by rowdy college crowds or",
          "We went to the Jockey Club for lunch which was lovely before we chilled out on the beach. You can book a bed for 60 euros if you get there early enough, we unfortunately didn't.",
          "This was the first time we had been here and on first look it didn't look good but it was lovely. One side is a bit pebbly and rocky n But if you are prepared to walk a bit the right hand side is lovely and sandy. There is a restaurant the and a small snack bar which we used and",
          "Lovely beach for gay and straight people all having a great sun-loving day, this place is quite special and quite under the fire due to its naked beaches, I love to go for its bars and restaurants, someone else like it for the as we called it once \"enchanted forest\"",
          "Owh i absolutely in love with this beach, if you prefer nude beach? This is the one, I wish the local council put some kind of road marks to make it easier to find the short cut but I suppose this is the fun bit? To find it then stay n enjoying the sun all day long",
          "A lot of people talks about this beach as \"the place to be\" and so on ... We decided to come here for one day on our trip to Ibiza. Since I am working in the airline industry I have seen many beaches around the globe, this one was a nice beach, but fantastic NO! and really not a",
          "Close ti Ibiza and very close to the salinas. Nice chirinquitos and shops. Full of people and great food",
          "Unfortunately this beach is a victim of it's own beauty. Ten years ago it was really unknown apart from by locals and those in the know. The bar (Sa Trinxa) was chilled with a genuine Ibiza vibe. Live saxophonist, fabulous food and drinks at great prices. Now it's incredibly",
          "Had a pleasant experience at this beach. It was long, with golden sand and clean water. Plenty of room to take your towel and park up on a spot if you dont want to pay for a chair and umbrella. Unfortunately you will get pestered by people trying to sell you",
          "Beach was very nice with a very nice bar restaurant near where you enter it through the trees. When we visited it was quite busy so we only stayed a short while and moved on.",
          "Great beach, great drive past the salt lakes. Up market yacht owner area. We took a catamaran from there to Formentora. Lovely long beach, up market restaurants etc. Watch out for the two Great Danes playing on the beach, lovely dogs very friendly.",
          "Don't expect much hot sunny weather if you go to the Balearics in April. We had a cold wind most days (especially the northerly one) and in 14 days only had 1 hot sunny day! That day we came here. Overall a good beach for those like me who don't like too much development. Clean",
          "We have visited this beach twice; once on a Sunday in August and once midweek in April. Obviously both visits were a totally different experience for reasons. In April there's plenty of space on the beach but not all the beach bars are open and the atmosphere is quite. In",
          "Found this beach by mistake, and what a find! It's a couple of mms from the old town and airport and is a beautiful pristine sandy beach with clear water and numerous facilities. Parking is free, there are lovely restaurants and bars hidden between the road and dunes, and there",
          "Great retreat beach for gay and straight people, not for children as you might bump into the naturist nudist beaches too. A great natural retreat for the calm and peaceful spot in Ibiza, great blue seas in many spots on this beach.",
          "Love this beach, I remember the first in time in 2013, walking the wooden path to the beach with someone special to be greeted by miles of amazing shoreline. A very busy beach but wonderful area and the beach bars are lovely. Went especially to meet Richie Hawtin so I could",
          "it is the cleanest and bepeople, the air we breathe,is a paradise,we want to return soon.ibiza is fantastic",
          "I prefer the beaches on the west and north side of the island, but Playa de Ses Salines is interesting. It does get crowed and parking is difficult if you don't get there early during the summer. It can get very crowded during season. Worth a trip there though just to view",
          "the southest beach of Ibiza - its a long stretch of white sand, the view is amazing and the water ultrablue and transparent, but its also the busiest! If you want some quiet spots, walk past all the beach bars - direction tower - and you will find some mini coves there are more",
          "this place is just amazing. it is always full of people but in the same time is quiet. The water is very clear and inviting for a swim. You need to book in advance if you want to spend the day in the amazing beds. The service is very good. Waiters are running around trying to",
          "A very nice beach a short bus ride from town. Lovely clear water & lotsoff little coves, you can find your own private beach. A few bars... but a bit expensive.",
          "One of the beaches that the IN crowd frequent\u2026.not too crowded the day I was there. Not the easiest to get to\u2026a taxi from hotel! Music and bar made it a pleasant few hours. hiring not the cheapest but the only way to go can move around to follow the sun and keep people",
          "One of the best beaches in Ibiza for people watching. Very crowded, but fun fun fun. Great sun exposure all day long",
          "You need a car to get there. The parking near the beach is 5\u20ac/day. You can also park a little further outside. Beach chairs and umbrellas to rent at high price, Toilets are only in the restaurants. The restaurants are very good, but also very expensive.",
          "Actually not my favorite due to the fact that that this beach is totally overcrowded. The sea is clear but some parts spoilt with seaweed. Many bars with some small parties late afternoon. There are also many annoying vendors bothering you. Bus stop (No 11 from Eivissa) is",
          "Great buzz on this beach, good people, clean and the water is amazing. Jockey Club for lunch is great and then head down to Sa Trinxa for a couple of late afternoon drinks with good tunes.",
          "Staying in Ibiza town? If so then a trip to Salines beach is a good way to spend a day. Bossa is good for a bit of a party but Salines is not much further round the coast and was about 18 euros in a taxi and takes about 20 mins. Peaceful and reminiscent of Formentera, not much",
          "Here you can find it all, some nice relaxing spots, But as well a beach bar with good music.. It is a little bit more Crowdy sometimes.. But here you find the more rich people as well.. Every beach has his own People.. Liked it a lot here!",
          "I enjoyed my stay here very much, the sand is soft and of light color. The restaurants are way ro expensive for what it is but worth relaxing and have some shadow every now and then",
          "If you are looking for a clean and quiet beach, keep walking along the coast line... After the last beach goers on the main beach there are some rocks and this paradise is between them.",
          "Las Salinas is a really nice beach but it's too full of tourist and PRs and sellers... You can't enjoy the beach without anyone trying to sell you something",
          "when we where in Salinas this year we had great waves, about 2 meters and with a air-matratz it was great fun! The water is very clear and a Little warmer then elsewhere on the Island. Beach was quite crowded and there is always Entertainment by Promoters, sellers and beach",
          "If you are going during the peak season, August, be sure to get there early if you want to be able to rent a lounger or umbrella. We got a late start to our day and arrived around 11 and there was not a lounger to be rented along the whole beach. We were able to snag an",
          "We went to this beach by bus from Ibiza town. It's a lovely, long sandy beach with clear shallow sea. It has got a very cosmopolitan feel and didn't hear many English voices. It was packed when we went but it was peak season, it looked like it would be difficult to park if you",
          "Nice long beach with something to look at. During the sunbathing you can look at al the people passing by (this is a place where people come to to look at and be looked at). All the large discotheques have a crew on the beach trying to lure people to there place. Most of the",
          "Beautiful beach definitely worth going to the beach, nice crystal clear water just like in the Caribbean. but the only thing that let's the beach down is the people coming every 2 seconds to sell souvenirs...",
          "Very good to relax with some chilling beats in the background.More for the older generation of people who love some chilling house beats",
          "If you go to either side of the umbrellas, you have a nice quiet portion of the beach. You can be clothing optional and not be disturbed.",
          "Ses Salines is a nice beach filled with people, restaurants and fun. The water is clean and pretty and there are plenty of people to sell you whatever type of clothing, food or drink you desire. The vendors can get a bit annoying because there are so many however they do leave",
          "One of the beaches to be, for rich and poor, trendy , young, , clothed or nudist, for relaxation or people watching",
          "very nice place . food and view friendly stuuf good cocktails and tasty food ...........................................10+",
          "Far too many lookie lookie men trying to sell, and we witnessed some dodgy goings on involving the lifeguard. A seller came over the fence dressed as a tourist, a couple of whistles and hand signals to the life guard and the the lifeguard went on a walk, so out came the goods.",
          "We spent a few days here. Beautiful beach with nice atmosphere. Driving was the most accessible way for us. Other options could be renting a scooter. I am unsure on the bus service. We had lunch in the Jockey Club both days which i recommend.",
          "Ibiza has a lot of beaches but this one is great - a bit like the carabean islands with everything you could want . The sea is just like Tahiti...",
          "Lovely beach, clear water and sandy beaches. Family friendly. Great bars and restaurants for all. Recommend Malibu for good quality food and wine, a bit more sophisticated than Guaros next door.",
          "very nice beach; perfect with little children as the sea is calm and not deep; also great beach bars with good music such as the Jockey club; shopping is possible on the beach; ideal beach for relaxing",
          "La Trinxa bar is fab...amazing atmosphere and music in a great setting. The beach has room for sunbathing but is not as busy as beaches in the main resorts, which is ideal in my opinion",
          "Love Playa de ses Salines, the vibe, the people, Jockey club does some great food whilst listening to chilled out music, but head towards the far end to Sa Trinxa for a more raw vibe, amazing music and mixed by John sa Trinxa himself most days and the food from the restaurant",
          "Very strange terrain - but nice to visit - its different. We discovered the salt flats while looking for El Chringuito - a great restaurant near Salines",
          "Another gorgeous beach in Ibiza with lots of restaurants & chair / umbrella rentals. I personally didn\u2019t think it was as nice as Playa d\u2019en Bossa was (where Ushuaia is located), but it\u2019s similar \u2013 long beach, relatively calm water, great for taking walks & people watching. For",
          "This is a very civilised beach as long as you don't leave it too late you have plenty of parking with shade so the car wont be too hot later. Walk down to the beach and pick your spot for the day some of the sunbeds are quite expensive if they are in front of one of the beach",

        "wiki": "Es Canar (Spanish: Es Can\u00e1) is a beach resort village on the Spanish island of Ibiza. The resort is in the municipality of Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu. The resort is reached along the street called Cami d'Escana from Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu. The resort is 12.4 miles (20.0 km) north east of Ibiza Town and 16.9 miles (27.2 km) of Ibiza Airport. The resort is 3.4 miles (5.5 km) along the coast, east of Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu. By Taxi or tourist bus the journey time from the airport is approximately 40 minutes.\n\n\n== The resort ==\nEs Canar is situated on the north eastern seaboard of the islands and as a consequence boasts a reputable sunrise, in contrast to the beautiful sunset found at San Antonio on the island's western side. The resort is compact and consists of mainly four and five storey hotels blocks with many restaurants and bars. The resort is heavily used by tourists during the summer months, and targeted at families. Within the resort there are several white sandy beaches. Also within the resort there is a bus station and pharmacy. From the bus station you are able to access the island other main resorts such as Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, Ibiza Town, San Antoni and Portinatx with buses leaving for these destinations every 20 minutes. There are also many shops throughout the resort, selling branded merchandise, as well as other smaller stores selling authentic Ibizan items. At the southern end of the beach is a small harbour where you can catch a ferry to Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, Ibiza Town, Formentera or one of the many small resorts on the south east coast of the island.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nTo the south of the resort is the wooded promontory of Punta Arab\u00ed, whilst west inland is a well watered plain. Just offshore from the beach there are the small islands sa Galera and Illa des Canar. In 2003 the beach at Es Canar was awarded a Blue Flag.\n\n\n== Fiestas ==\nEvery July the Spanish celebration of Saint Christopher happens in this resort, usually in the first week of July whereby a carnival procession passes through the resort, en route to Santa Eul\u00e0ria with the event culminating in an impressive fireworks display.\n\n\n== Hippy market ==\nEvery Wednesday, the Hippy Market takes place at Punta Arab\u00ed south of the resorts main center. In the 1960s during the hippy era, many Hippies settled on the Ibiza and began to eke out a living by making trinkets and gifts out of wood, metals and steels, thus the tradition of the markets on the island began, and are still going strong today.\n\n\n== Language ==\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken throughout all Ibizan towns and nearby Formentera, though Catalan also shares co-official status with Spanish.\" Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island,  other languages like English, German and Italian, are also spoken. Polylinguality is the norm, not the exception.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlatja Es Canar (The Beach)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial tourism site for Ibiza",

          "This was a very small and crowded beach, but I did not mind staying on this beach. Driving to the parking area was nerve wrecking when you are driving an hire car and can't see if what is around the sharp bend! Great beach for families and kids.",
          "One of the best beaches on the island, and in particular in Portinatx. Even in high season it is a blast to have such crystal clear sea.",
          "We did not expect too much from a small bechside cafe/restaurant but we were pleasantly surprised. The food seemed to be freshly prepared and was very nice - quite simple but nicely cooked and well prepared. The seafood was very fresh. The service was a bit slow but we were",
          "This place is a must for any food lover. Excellent food,charming atmosphere with excellent service. Definitely recommend this one.",
          "A beautiful small beach without the usual cove! I was surprised at how busy the small stretch of sand had become so early in the day. If you enjoy rock pools: this is is the beach for you.",
          "This beach was busy but not too crowded in April, but I can imagine it being a nightmare in July. It's pretty big and the water quality is good. Not sure if there are public toilets, but there is a restaurant.",
          "Nice stop for a short dip. Not much here but pretty as ever, water clear and framed but trees and cliffs. Small and short road.",
          "Even thought the mud baths were off-season (ie all dried up in summer - bring a bucket or you won't get the benefit!!!) I drifted left to their cove anyway and, boy, was it worth it!",
          "This is a great place for a bit of relaxing and enjoying the sun. I would bring your snorkel as there is plenty of fish to have a lot and the sea was stunningly clear and very warm. Just be aware there are sea urchins and can be painful if trod on. The only negative with",
          "We decided to go for a lunch in the only restaurant on the beach... bad idea! Low quality food, terrible service and extremely expensive. They try to sell the catch of the day for 80-90 euros per kg, fortunately we avoided that... 10 euros for a tiny salad or a bad tortilla.",
          "Beautiful, traditional beach, great snorkelling once you swim past the sea grass, take beach shoes and swim out to the rocks where you can climb up and jump in (go careful), if you get there early you can park by the beach, we arrived about 0930 and parked no probs, once spaces",
          "Well, every corner is incredibly beautiful in ibiza,. The sea it is clean and colorful everywhere. If I can suggest a thing...it is definitely better to visit all these places by boat..",
          "We discovered this cala. It was perfect for us to swim and do snorkeling as there are a lot of fishs but also for our son who likes to jump for the rocks!!!",
          "Visited here during our current Ibiza vacation. It's a nice cove that wasn't over crowded during our visit on a Thursday. There are nice areas for snorkeling. Swimming is possible through out the cove. The restaurant on-site is very overpriced, even for pre packaged ice cream.",
          "Lovely spot for a stop off but continue on once you have had a snorkel - there is always another bay around the corner. Small restaurant and picturesque but not for the whole day for us",
          "Lovely cove, ten minutes outside of Poetinatx. The bar in situ is expensive and nothing to write home about. Food there reasonable but again, overpriced.",
          "Sadly it seems that everybody visits here because if the \"South Pacific\" movie fame. We were very disappointed and really could not see the attraction as there are so many better beaches in Ibiza.",
          "We visited this twice, once when it was colder and windy and had nice big waves and once in the sunshine, like 2 different beaches! Great beach in the sun, shallow waters with loads of rocks so great for snorkelling. We visited the restaurant once but it was expensive",
          "We were here to have lunch. Yet we found out that the only restaurant was closed for the season already, despite enough people still being around here. ..the parking space was quite full. The bay is absolutely beautiful, yet not very inviting to relax with only rocky surface.",
          "A nice, dark sand beach, watershoes advised because of the small stones. This was the first beach in Ibiza we visited: easy parking, children learned how to snorkel in 15 minutes. Great to snorkel a bit further in the water from rock to rock.",
          "Great place, went twice during our stay. Great for swimming and scuba diving with kids. Renting sun beds is cheap. Grilled fish at beach restaurant was good.",

          "We have been to this beach on our last visit to Ibiza so made sure we returned this holiday. Quiet busy although it was late in the afternoon but the crystal waters made it a must. There isn't any shade there so to stay all day you need to take a parasol. There's a shop there",
          "loved this beach above many others. Best in the morning as it is east facing, but you can move across the bay to neighbouring beaches as the day progresses",
          "Cute out of the way beach with restaurant. Can I say nothing special? Sorry Ibiza! Better beaches elsewhere but I guess if you're staying nearby it's sweet enough. Who can't love the charm of Ibiza right? This is where I wish there was a 'good' rating in between average and very",

          "Me and my girlfriend went tot Cala Xarraca, but it was terrible. The view is great but it's the only place where you can eat at cala Xarraca. And you'll notice it in the prices of the restaurant. It's overpriced and the food is not bad, but certainly not worth the cost. Ps.",
          "After a nice day at the small but idealic beach we had a quick dinner. It was the worst dinner I had in years. I ordered the entrecote and grilled squid. Not cheap (\u20ac21 per dish) Not tasteful at all, they put no love in the food. Would recommend it for drinks, but do not eat at",

          "It was a beautiful little beach with very clear water. I'd recommend leaving my car up on the main road and walk down from there. Try the right side first to take in the complete environment and take some scenic pics! You can go swimming from the beach, but also from the rocks",
          "This place is really pretty, but if you want a bit of a quiet time, you should walk to the far end and go over the rocks to the more abandoned parts. Downside is that it got shady pretty early.",
          "The beach although in the amex guide does not worth the visit. There is no sand and there are rocks all over the water, you must wear special shoes. Although the view is nice i did not enjoy like the other beaches ive visited in the north side of the island. Portinatx cala was",

          "gritty, pebbly and sea weedy and yet crowded and full of the sunbeds and tatty bar you see on every beach in Ibiza no matter how tiny. Enjoy the view from the easy roadside parking. Don't bother walking down the steep hill to this grotty beach.",

          "Before decending into Cala Xarraca it is worthwhile pulling into the hard shoulder of the road (safely) and taking in the sights of the beautiful views Cala Xarraca has to offer. The views of the boats on the deep blue clear water is breathtaking and well worth seeing. As you",

          "stunning little bay, when we visited there were a few top end motor boats moored up, there were about 8 sun loungers on the beach. This is a small beach mainly used by locals, it is shingle and extremely hot under foot !!!",

          "contrary to the experience of some other reviewers, i thought that the lunch we had at the beach hut here was excellent. we had gambas a la plancha and salad and chips. i have not been back yet this year, but we are planning to. mostly because of the lunch. from memory",

          "We were just driving towards Portinatx and decided to stop when saw the beautiful landscape. It very quiet and we had a great time in this beach. Try to find pearls like that when going to Ibiza. Better than the popular beaches.",
          "A regular spot to spend the afternoon. Not amazing, not bad. Just average. There's a service to rent beach umbrellas for 6\u20ac. That's expensive. You can buy one for not so much more.",

          "Beautiful beach such a shame nobody could go in the sea due to plague of jellyfish. Wanted to go for a snorkel and a swim and had we have been able to swim or even paddle this would have got four or even five stars. But you can't give it any more than two stars if you can't go",
          "Lovely location. Sand not the best and a lot of jellyfish while we were there. The rates for the sunbeds was \u20ac3 more per bed than the main beaches in Portinax",

        "wiki": "Tourism in Spain is the third major contributor to national economic life after the industrial and the business/banking sectors, contributing about 10\u201311% of Spain's GDP. Ever since the 1960s and 1970s, the country has been a popular destination for summer holidays, especially with large numbers of tourists from the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, the Benelux, and the United States, among others. Accordingly, Spain's foreign tourist industry has grown into the second-biggest in the world.\n\nIn 2019, Spain was the second most visited country in the world, recording 83.7 million tourists which marked the seventh consecutive year of record-beating numbers.Spain ranks first among 140 countries in the biannual Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index published by the World Economic Forum in 2019, matching the top position already achieved in 2017 and 2015.The World Tourism Organization has its headquarters in Madrid.\nAccording to The Economist 2005 year list, Spain has the world's 10th highest quality of life.\n\n\n== Arrivals by country ==\n\nMost visitors arriving to Spain on a short term basis were from the following countries:\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nSpain's national airline is Iberia, but the country can be flown into on many international passenger airlines and charter airlines.\nTourists also arrive in Spain by road, rail and over the water. Spanish freeways interconnecting the touristic cities are also linked with the French freeway network across the Pyrenees. The main train operator is RENFE, including AVE (Spanish high speed train) or Talgo intercity services. Spain's high-speed rail link is the largest in Europe and second largest in the world after China. There is also a number of high-end tourism oriented hotel-train services, such as Transcant\u00e1brico.\n\n\n== Summer resorts and beaches ==\n\nThis type of tourism was the first to be developed in Spain, and today, generates the most income for the Spanish economy.\nThe mild climate during the whole year and the extensive sandy beaches of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean as well as of its two archipelagoes (the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands respectively) have been attracting tourists from  Northern Europe for decades. The leading source markets of Spanish beach tourism are the UK (around 24% of the total arrivals in Spain in recent years), Germany and France (around 15-16% each), followed by Scandinavia and Italy (around 7% each) and the Netherlands (around 5%).The most popular Spanish mainland coasts are on its Mediterranean side, and include, from north to south clockwise:\n\nThe Costa Brava, the Costa Daurada and the Costa del Maresme, in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, very popular with visitors from France as well as inland Spain, with notable resorts like Salou and the city of Barcelona.\nThe Costa Blanca, (one of the most developed coastal areas of Spain, extremely popular for tourists from the United Kingdom and Germany, with Benidorm as the leading summer city of Spain) and the Costa del Azahar are both in the Valencian Community.\nThe Costa C\u00e1lida in the Region of Murcia and the Mar Menor, a lagoon by the Mediterranean sea.\nThe Costa de Almer\u00eda, the Costa Tropical, the Costa del Sol and the Costa de la Luz, all in the community of Andalusia. Some of the summer destinations here are renowned worldwide, such as Marbella in M\u00e1laga Province or Sotogrande in C\u00e1diz province, both destinations for tourists and summer residents with big purchasing power. The city of M\u00e1laga is a notable Costa del Sol destination and also one of the largest harbours in Spain and frequented by cruise ships.\nSpain's two archipelagoes, the Balearic Islands off the mainland coast in the Mediterranean and the volcanic Canary Islands in the Atlantic, are also both very popular destinations with Spaniards and Europeans.\n\nIn addition to the summer tourism, other modalities like cultural and monumental tourism congresses, sport or fun tourism have been developed in these areas, including such famous cities as Barcelona and Valencia, the biggest harbours of the Spanish Mediterranean coast.\nMany coastal or island places also have great ecological and natural importance. Theme Parks like Terra M\u00edtica, Tibidabo Amusement Park, Tivoli World and the resort PortAventura World or diverse water-fun parks are also popular.\nIn 2014 Spain broke its own record of blue flag beaches, achieving 681 flags and becoming the leader in the Northern Hemisphere. Spain is also the leader in blue flags for marinas.\n\n\n== Cultural tourism, business tourism ==\n\nAs a crossroads of several civilizations, Spain offers a number of historical cities and towns. Major destinations include Spain's two largest cities: Madrid and Barcelona, which stand as two of the leading city destinations in Europe. Both offer a matchless number of attractions and their importance in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, sports and arts contribute to their status as two of the world's major global cities.\nFifteen Spanish cities have been declared World Heritage Cities by the UNESCO:Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, \u00c1vila, Baeza, C\u00e1ceres, C\u00f3rdoba, Cuenca, Ibiza, M\u00e9rida, Salamanca, San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, Santiago de Compostela, Segovia, Tarragona, Toledo and Ubeda. As of October 2016, Spain has 45 total sites inscribed on the list, third only to Italy (51) and China (50). Of these 45 sites, 40 are cultural, 3 are natural, and 2 are mixed (meeting both cultural and natural criteria), as determined by the organization's selection criteria.\nOther first-class destinations are Seville, Granada, Santander, Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n. All of them with historical landmarks and a lively cultural agenda.\n\n\n=== Student programs ===\nBesides hosting some of the most renowned business schools in the world such as IE Business School, ESADE or IESE Business School, Spain is a popular destination for students from abroad. In particular, during the 2010-11 academic year Spain was the European country receiving the most Erasmus programme students.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nSpain is an important place for Catholicism. In fact, some of the holiest places for the Catholic Church are in Spain: city of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia (North-West Spain), the third holiest place after the Vatican City in Rome and Jerusalem. It is also the terminus of the Way of Saint James. Santo Toribio de Li\u00e9bana, Cantabria (also in North Spain) is the fourth, followed by Caravaca de la Cruz at the South-East, (fifth holiest place). These places attract pilgrims and tourists from all over the world.\nReligion also has found its artistic expression through the popular Holy Week processions, which become important in almost every town.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMost festivals turn around patron saints, legends, local customs and folklore. Among the most singular ones stand out the Seville Fair (Feria de Abril in Spanish), the Romer\u00eda de El Roc\u00edo in Almonte, Huelva, the world-famous Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, the Fallas in Valencia, the Tomatina in Bu\u00f1ol, Valencia and the Fiestas del Pilar in Zaragoza.\nThe Carnival is also popular all over Spain, but especially in the Canary Islands (Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife) and Cadiz. \nThere are renowned movie festivals all over the country, the most recognizable being the famous San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, the M\u00e1laga Spanish Film Festival, the Seminci (Valladolid International Film Festival), the Mostra de Valencia and the Sitges Film Festival, the world's foremost international festival specializing in fantasy and horror movies. Music festivals includes the S\u00f3nar, the FIB, the Festimad, the Primavera Sound, the Bilbao BBK Live, the Monegros Desert Festival and the SOS 4.8 Festival.\nSeveral cities have hosted international events: the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the 1992 Summer Olympics, all in Barcelona, the Universal fair of 1992 in Seville, the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, and the Expo 2008 in Zaragoza. In addition, some Spanish cities have been or will be European Capital of Culture: Madrid in 1992; Santiago de Compostela in 2000, Salamanca in 2002, and San Sebasti\u00e1n in 2016.\n\n\n== Nightlife ==\n\nThe nightlife in Spain is very attractive to both tourists and locals. Spain is known to have some of the best nightlife in the world. Big cities such as Madrid and Barcelona are favorites amongst the large and popular discoth\u00e8ques. For instance, Madrid is known as the number one party city for clubs such as Pacha and Kapital (seven floors), and Barcelona is famous for Opium and Sutton famous clubs. The discoth\u00e8ques in Spain are open until hours such as 7am. The Baleraric Islands, such as Ibiza and Mallorca, are known to be major party destinations, as well as favored summer resort and in Andalusia, Malaga, specially the area of the Costa del Sol.\nIbiza is a relatively small island and its cities have become world-famous for their associations with tourism, nightlife, and the electronic music the island has originated. It is well known for its summer club scene which attracts very large numbers of tourists, but the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office have controversially been working to promote more family-oriented tourism. Noted clubs include Space, Privilege, Amnesia, Ushua\u00efa, Pacha, DC10, Eden, and Es Paradis. Ibiza is also home to the legendary \"port\" in Ibiza Town, a popular stop for many tourists and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Majorca or Mallorca is an island located in the Mediterranean Sea. It is the largest island in the Balearic Islands archipelago, in Spain.\nThe capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Majorca (in the municipality of Palma). The anthem of Majorca is La Balanguera.\nLike the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany, Ireland, Poland, the Scandinavian countries, and the United Kingdom. The name derives from Latin insula maior, \"larger island\"; later Maiorica, \"the larger one\" in comparison to Menorca, \"the smaller one\".\n\n\n== Winter tourism ==\n\nSpain is a generally mountainous country, with well-known ski resorts located in several parts of the country, including the Pyrenees, the Sistema Central, the Sistema Ib\u00e9rico and Sierra Nevada.\nFor the most part, the main crest forms a massive divider between France and Spain, with the tiny country of Andorra sandwiched in between. The Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre have historically extended on both sides of the mountain range, with small northern portions now in France and much larger southern parts now in Spain.Sierra Nevada in Spain is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of Europe's most southerly ski resorts, in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of Granada and, a little further, Almer\u00eda and M\u00e1laga.\nParts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park. The range has also been declared a biosphere reserve. The Sierra Nevada Observatory is located on the northern slopes at an elevation of 2,800 metres (9,200 ft). The Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny, a mountain-building event that also formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Sierra as observed today formed during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 to 1.8 million years ago) from the collision of the African and Eurasian continental plates.\n\n\n== Nature and rural tourism ==\n\nSpain is the second largest country in the European Union. Its latitude puts part of the country  in direct contact with the typical southern end of the Atlantic polar jet. Hence, Spain's geographical position allows for Atlantic fronts typically affecting its western and northern part whereas a Mediterranean influenced climate is generally prevalent in its eastern and southern parts, with transition climates linking both main bioclimatic regions. Additionally the presence of several mountain ranges ultimately shape the diverse landscape of Spain. Another remarkable feature of the country is its vast coast, as a result of being in a Peninsula; moreover, there is the coast of the two Spanish archipelagos: the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.\n\nTo date, Spain has a total of 15 National Parks, of which 10 are on the mainland, 1 in the Balearic Islands and 4 in the Canary Islands. Spain's most visited National Park is the Teide National Park in the Canary Islands, with 3,142,148 visitors in 2007 and crowned with the third largest Volcano in the world from its base, the Teide, with 3,718 meters above the sea level (also the highest point in Spain). The Teide also has the distinction of being the most visited national park in Europe and second in the world.On top of that, by 2016 Spain is home to 48 biosphere reserves, covering 5.5 million hectares, almost 11% of the country, making Spain the world leader of such protected areas\n\n\n== Art and culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums in Madrid ===\n\nMadrid is considered one of the top European destinations concerning art museums. Best known is the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three museums. The most famous one is the Prado Museum, known for such highlights as Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas and Francisco de Goya's La maja vestida and La maja desnuda.

The museum is mainly dedicated to Spanish art. Highlights of the museum include excellent collections of Spain's greatest 20th-century masters, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Joan Mir\u00f3, Juan Gris and Julio Gonz\u00e1lez. Certainly the most famous masterpiece in the museum is Picasso's painting Guernica. The Reina Sof\u00eda also hosts a free-access library specializing in art, with a collection of over 100,000 books, over 3,500 sound recordings and almost 1,000 videos.\n\nThe Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum is an art museum that fills the historical gaps in its counterparts' collections: in the Prado's case this includes Italian primitives and works from the English, Dutch and German schools, while in the case of the Reina Sofia the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, once the second largest private collection in the world after the British Royal Collection, includes Impressionists, Expressionists, and European and American paintings from the second half of the 20th century, with over 1,600 paintings.The Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando currently functions as a museum and gallery that houses a fine art collection of paintings from the 15th to 20th centuries: Giovanni Bellini, Correggio, Rubens, Zurbar\u00e1n, Murillo, Goya, Juan Gris, Pablo Serrano. The academy is also the headquarters of the Madrid Academy of Art. Francisco Goya was once one of the academy's directors, and, its alumni include Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda, Juan Luna, and Fernando Botero.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Madrid is the official residence of Felipe VI of Spain, but he uses it only for official acts. It is a baroque palace full of artworks and one of the largest European Royal Palaces, which is characterized by its luxurious rooms and its rich collections of armors and weapons, pharmaceutical, silverware, watches, paintings, tapestries and the most comprehensive collection of Stradivarius in the world\n\nThe National Archaeological Museum of Spain collection includes, among others, Pre-historic, Celtic, Iberian, Greek and Roman antiquities and medieval (Visigothic, Muslim and Christian) objects. Highlights include a replica of the Altamira cave (the first cave in which prehistoric cave paintings were discovered), Lady of Elche (an enigmatic polychrome stone bust), Lady of Baza (a famous example of Iberian sculpture), Biche of Balazote (an Iberian sculpture) and Treasure of Guarrazar (a treasure that represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings and the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work).The Museum of the Americas is a national museum that holds artistic, archaeological and ethnographic collections from the whole Americas, ranging from the Paleolithic period to the present day. The permanent exhibit is divided into five major thematical areas: an awareness of the Americas, the reality of the Americas, society, religion and communication.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural Sciences is the National Museum of Natural History of Spain. The research departments of the museum are: Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Ecology, Paleobiology, Vulcanology and Geology.The Naval Museum is managed by the Ministry of Defence. The Museum's mission is to acquire, preserve, investigate, report and display for study, education and contemplation, parts, sets and collections of historical, artistic, scientific and technical related to naval activity in order to disseminate the story sea of Spain; to help illustrate, highlight and preserve their traditions and promote national maritime awareness.\n\nThe Monastery of Las Descalzas Reales resides in the former palace of King Charles I of Spain and Isabel of Portugal. Their daughter, Joan of Austria, founded this convent of nuns of the Poor Clare order in 1559. Throughout the remainder of the 16th century and into the 17th century, the convent attracted young widowed or spinster noblewomen. Each woman brought with her a dowry. The riches quickly piled up, and the convent became one of the richest convents in all of Europe. It has many works of Renaissance and Baroque art, including a recumbent Christ by Gaspar Becerra, a staircase whose paintings were painted by unknown author (perhaps Vel\u00e1zquez) and they are considered of the masterpieces of Spanish illusionist painting, and Brussels tapestries inspired by paintings of Rubens.The Museum of L\u00e1zaro Galdiano houses an encyclopedic collection specializing in decorative arts.\nApart from paintings and sculptures it displays 10th-century Byzantine enamel; Arab and Byzantine ivory chests; Hellenistic, Roman, medieval, renaissance, baroque and romantic jewelry; Pisanello and Pompeo Leoni medals; Spanish and Italian ceramics; Italian and Arab clothes and a collection of weapons including the sword of Pope Innocent VIII.The Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas (National Museum of Decorative Arts) is one of the oldest museums in the city.

It is sponsored by the Catalan-Balearic bank la Caixa and located next to the Sal\u00f3n del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, which combined an old unused industrial building and hollowed it out at the base and inside and placed on top further floors which are encased with rusted steel. Next to it is an art installation of green plants growing on the wall of the neighbouring house by French botanist Patrick Blanc. The red of the top floors with the green of the wall next to it form a contrast. The green is in reflection of the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens.\nOther art galleries and museums in Madrid include:\n\n\n=== Museums in Barcelona ===\n\nThis is a list of museums in Barcelona (Catalonia) and in its surrounding metropolitan area.\n\nArchaeology Museum of Barcelona (MAC)\nMuseu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA)\nMuseu del Modernisme Catal\u00e0 MMCAT\nCaixaForum Barcelona\nCasa \u00c0sia\nCentre d'Art Santa M\u00f2nica (CASM)\nCentre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona (CCCB)\nCosmocaixa Barcelona (former Museu de la Ci\u00e8ncia de Barcelona)\nEspai Gaud\u00ed (La Pedrera)\nFundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies\nOlympic and Sports Museum Joan Antoni Samaranch\nFundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3\nFundaci\u00f3 Su\u00f1ol\nFC Barcelona Museum\nGracia Arts Project\nPalau Reial de Pedralbes\nMuseu de Cer\u00e0mica\nMuseu de les Arts Decoratives\nMuseu T\u00e8xtil i d'Indument\u00e0ria\nMuseu d'Aut\u00f2mates\nMuseu Barbier-Mueller d'Art Precolomb\u00ed\nMuseu del Cal\u00e7at\nMuseu de Cera de Barcelona\nMuseum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona\nMuseum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main exhibition site, at the Forum Building)\nMartorell Museum (the historical site where the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882, but contained the Geology Museum from 1924 to 2010)\nLaboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: Zoology Museum)\nBotanical garden of Barcelona\nHistorical Botanical Garden of Barcelona\nMuseu del Clavegueram\nMuseu del C\u00f2mic i la Il\u00b7lustraci\u00f3\nMuseu Egipci de Barcelona\nMuseu de l'Er\u00f2tica de Barcelona\nMuseu Etnol\u00f2gic de Barcelona\nMuseu Frederic Mar\u00e8s\nMuseu Gaud\u00ed\nMuseu d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya\nMuseu d'Hist\u00f2ria de la Ciutat\nCentre d'Interpretaci\u00f3 del Park G\u00fcell\nMuseu Mar\u00edtim\nMuseu Militar de Barcelona (closed May 2009)\nMuseu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona\nNational Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC)\nMuseu del Perfum - Fundaci\u00f3 Planas Giralt\nMuseu Picasso\nMuseu Taur\u00ed\nMuseu de la Xocolata\nPalau de la Virreina\nPalau Robert\nSala Ciutat\nSagrada Familia\n\n\n=== Other major museums in Spain ===\n\nBilbao Fine Arts Museum\nCarmen Thyssen Museum in M\u00e1laga\nCity of Arts and Sciences in Valencia\nDal\u00ed Theatre and Museum in Figueres\nGuggenheim Museum in Bilbao\nIVAM (Valencia)\nMuseo Picasso M\u00e1laga\nCentro Pompidou M\u00e1laga\nMuseu de Belles Arts de Val\u00e8ncia\nMuseum of Fine Arts of Seville\n\n\n== Impact by Coronavirus ==\nIn the early 2020, the country halted its tourism industry following the spread of coronavirus.

          "In Madrid there are many museums to see, but as we've been to Madrid several times we decided on this museum for this trip It has Picasso's masterpiece Guernica along with many works by Salvador Dali .We had a thoroughly good visit.",
          "Museo Reina is a must if visiting Madrid! Amazing collection of art situated in a beautiful setting. Be sure to explore the backside... there\u2019s a whole other side that we almost missed.",
          "This was the main reason as why we visited Madrid. To see Pablo Picasso's Guernica was an absolute privilege. Not disappointed.",
          "Wow. Just wow. But heads up, go on a day when you can recover afterwards with a ca\u00f1a or a tinto, because this cuts close to the bone.",
          "One of the few places open on a monday in Madrid it is worth a visit. Great collection of Picasso,Braque and a few really interesting Dali pieces. Of course the main attraction is Guernica, it even warrants a room of its own. No photos prevens an annoying build up of people in",
          "As this museum is the home of Guernica, Picasso's masterpiece, it is a MUST see if you visit Madrid (in fact, seeing it could be the reason to visit Madrid).",
          "Went after 7pm when it was free. I\u2019m not a huge fan of modern art so I didn\u2019t like it very much. Would be upset if I paid admission. Guernica was great to see in person, but so many tourists trying to take photos so the guards were shouting non stop.",
          "The main entrance is undergoing renovation, so enter via the new building. The museum is big and takes a while to navigate. There are lots of works but the highlights for me were the works of Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso in there. The must see of the entire is Picasso\u2019s",
          "You might go for the Picasso or Dail but there are many contemporaries that if you aren't an art historian you might not know about and be surprised how good there work is! Also you get to see some early Picasso and Dali works that are out of context from what they are famous",
          "A vast building centered around a central garden . some rooms are full of rubbish others some of the best 20 th Cent art you will find anywhere . Skip the rooms with concrete blocks masquerading as high art and head for the Picasso's and other cubists plus Picasso's",
          "An incredible collection of modern art. Guernica is not to be missed. If you're an art fan, you could easily spend a morning/aftenroon here. We found the museum sometimes difficult to navigate, though - make sure you ask for a map. We didn't get an audio guide, and probably",
          "Went to just experience the collection, and was blown away by J\u00f6rg Immendorf retrospective exhibition.",
          "Shocking how this one escapes the crowds! While everyone lines up at the Prado, stop here and stand in front of Dali and Piscasso without any crowds.",
          "The Museum has contemporary art located near Atocha Train Station, and it\u2019s part of the Golden Triangle of The Arts It has two entrances, the front with many steps to Plaza de Juan Goytisolo, next to the beautiful Hotel Mediod\u00eda. The one in the back don\u2019t have any stairs and",
          "We actually didn't plan on visiting, however, we walked by it on the way to another destination and decided \"what the heck!\" It's a beautiful museum with some thought-provoking works to include several Picassos and of course, one of his most famous: Guernica. I'm so glad I had",
          "Like so many galleries, the sheer volume of art works is intimidating and it is necessary to plan in advance what you want to see. We headed straight to room 206 to see the Guernica so we would be fresh to absorb and appreciate it .. and it is certainly worth seeing in 'the",
          "The pieces on the museum live up to the hype. The galleries are spacious and - compared to other major sites - not TOO ram-packed. The staff are a bit severe though: not only do they carry handcuffs, but they seem to view their job as being there to make sure nobody is having a",
          "When you are in Madrid you must visit Reina Sofia Museum. Guernica is a masterpiece. But not only this painting of Picasso is great, there are many more. There is also a great selection of Dali, Miro and many others. Spend one afternoon in this great museum. Together with Prado",
          "Probably it is the exterior aspect, with all windows blocked by iron bars, but also the interior experience makes it difficult to differentiate it from a jail. The reason: the total rudeness of most (not all) of the staff who should be trained in how to differentiate a museum",
          "I enjoyed this art gallery so much more than the Prado. Personal preference obviously. I especially wanted to see Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d and it did not disappoint. Very moving, especially when you know the history and meaning of the painting. Several other artists depict the",
          "We were told about this museum as part of a special deal that gave you access to the Thyssen, the Prado and here. We planned to go to the other two, but weren\u2019t aware of this place but thought we would give it a go and glad we did. I\u2019d be lying if I said I understood a lot of",
          "Excellent collection of 20th century arts - Picasso (Guernica!!!!), Dali, Mondrian... and much more to enjoy. And you can learn a lot about civil war in Spain",
          "Great collection of 20th century art with Picasso's Guernica the standout. Painted to express his outrage over the Nazi bombing of a Basque city in northern Spain, ordered by General Franco. if your are over 65 you get in for free and there are free entry times for all ages",
          "Worth the visit to see the classic and the collection of Dali but as someone who isn\u2019t really into modern art the rest was a little lost on me. Lots of space fillers in my opinion when most people are there for the Picasso and Dali. Even if that\u2019s the case though, worth it",
          "Very difficult to understand. No captions and no guided route with lines or arrows. Guernica is imposing, good reason to come here. However, We are not experts in this type of art and we have not understood it. 10\u20ac for each ticket.",
          "This is marmite. If you love modern art you'll love it here. Who knows you might discover you love modern art when you visit. But, if you have an inclination you don't like modern art, expect the worst.",
          "We spent two hours between 7-9 pm on a Thursday and focussed on the major works. As we were spending the whole of the next day at the Prado, this was enough for us. Delightful...and free!",
          "I was happy to have the chance to visit the museum. It is acknowledged for Gernika, but there is much more to enjoy.",
          "Museo Reina Sofia and too-swiftly brushed off Guernika, one of the most powerful and devastating anti-war works of art in history as \u201cthe now-cancelled Picasso\u2019s cri de coeur\u201d.

          "we did not plan enough time, 2 hour is not even enough time for knowing the ways. The picaso piece is especially great, with his progression of the work on the wall, this one room can take you 45 min.",
          "This is a quite well sized museum where you can spend a good afternoon browsing about. I'd recommend visiting the second level later in the afternoon or quite early, since everyone is looking for the Guernica.",
          "After seeing an exhibition about Guernica in Toulouse last summer, this was the perfect ending to that exhibition. It's an incredible piece of art and the main reason we visited this museum. We did enjoy the other works by Picasso, as well as those by Miro and Dali. There was",
          "In the same line as Prado, art fans should be prepared that they won\u2019t be allowed to take pictures here, at least not the \u201cfamous\u201d ones! Really dissapointing, even more with the excuses provided by the employees! Apart from that, light, spaces, facilities, etc. were great! But",
          "Excellent museum with a lot of stuff to explore in depth. We only managed to visit the second level where Guernica is located. We choose audioguide and we really enjoyed every room in the second level not only Picasso's masterpiece, we also adored work of Miro and Dali.",

          "This gallery houses one of Europe's most impressive collections of art and perhaps one of the 20th century's most important painting in Guernica by Picasso. A life long dream to visit was realized. After visiting the Thiessen and El Prado on the previous days, I was allowed",
          "We had previously visited the Prado (see review) which we found overcrowded. By contrast, the Sofia was a much more pleasant experience and unlike the Prado it appeared that they did control the numbers entering. The building is very easy to navigate and well set out. We very",

          "Modern art is not my strong suit - but I enjoyed this museum nonetheless. Of course, you must see Picasso's Guernica, one of the most significant paintings in recent history. The museum has policy of no photos in that gallery - while this doesn't mitigate the crowds, it at least",

          "Seniors of 65+ have free entrance. I choose to visit the fourth floor where the most recent art is represented. Good quality collection and presented in a logical way with enough white around the paintings. From my earlier visits I know that the 1st floor is a bit difficult to",
          "Disappointing for us and a great deal was very modern or way out images, sculpture, paints or video. Entry for me as I am older was free but price was high for what you got. There is some classical master works by Dali and Picasso that are great to have seen. It is a very large",
          "The Reina Sofia holds a fairly good collection of modern art, concentrating on works by Spanish painters. There are a few good works by Dali, Miro' and some excellent works by Juan Gris (his paintings in the museum awakened a new appreciation in me for this artist). But",

It contains one of the World\u2019s great works-Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica.\u201d Breathtaking and perhaps one of the most important works of the 20th century. The museum contains the modern collection and is wonderful. This is a must visit in Madrid.",

          "Absolutely amazing modern Artwork from Picasso to Dali and many more!! Biggest downside is that each room is not connected to the next so you have to exit and move around. For instance: sections 205 & 206 are next to each other and shown to be connected on the map but we were",
          "Wow, we only scratched the surface in 3 hours. So much to see. I prebooked a ticket with the Tiquets app for 8 euros and it was well worth it. There was a very long queue when we turned up. My husband who is over 65 got a free ticket by showing his passport. Overall very",
          "What a great way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon! We were there Sunday afternoon and get in for free. Spent about a couple of hours here and left very satisfied.",
          "Worth the visit for Picasso's legendary \"Guernica\" and the associated art and documentation about its historical context. The rest of the museum is mostly a barren wasteland of modern art of varying quality, although if you are a lover of modern art there are bound to be",
          "We were looking forward to seeing Pablo Picasso's Guernica in person and we were not disappointed. The only problem was you can hardly see the entire piece as the place is so crowded. People are huddled over the front of the painting. The museum also has some really great",
          "If not for Guernica the Prado is the place to go. It's too bad we were not able to take a picture of the masterpiece but it is etched in or minds.",
          "Huge building full of modern art. Fantastic selection of Dali works. And of course Guernica. The leaflet/plan of the museum could definitely be improved. We had to ask staff where the most famous works were - the answer is that they are on Floor 2!",
          "Ok go to to see Guernica. If you want to see a good range of works over a wider period go to the Thyssen.",
          "If you're into 20th century art, this museum is an absolute must, especially for Picasso. There are more of his iconic works here than in Barcelona. I spent about half an hour taking in Guernica. Also lots of works by Dali, Miro, Gris and all the great European and American",
          "Monday was museum day for us in Madrid. We started at Reina-Sofia, and were able to stand in front of Picasso\u2019s magnificent and heartbreaking Guernica. There are plenty of other works to see, but the museum lay-out is confusing. No photos of Guernica are allowed. Although we",
          "After one really busy day and really heavy lunch, I headed to the Reina-Sofia on my own and enjoyed full two hours there (it was my second visit, so my husband bailed out). Not every painting was to my taste (I am not a fan of ultra modern art and splashes of ink on a canvas",
          "Enjoyed it. Guernica is a must see. They don\u2019t let you take photos like they used to, so check the signage. The 4th floor with temporary exhibit was pretty empty, but still had some Picassos and other works by famous artists, so it\u2019s still worth a look. The 3rd floor was closed.",
          "Wonderful museum which is laid out by their director in a very informative manner. Many Dalis and Picassos",
          "Although we are not really fans of Modern Art, we thought the museum did a good job displaying it and telling about the pieces. Lots of Picasso, Lots of Spanish Civil war art and whole rooms on the darker side of life.. Easy to navigate. Crowded as expected. Try to go early",
          "This gorgeous building houses some even more gorgeous art - it's well worth coming to Madrid just to see the art. Guernica is my favorite painting, and seeing it in person was absolutely mesmerizing and stunning. However, even if you don't like Guernica, there's plenty to see",
          "We went during the free hours to see some of the main pieces. The art and building are breath taking. Obviously most people are there to see the Guernica (sp) but there is so much more than that. We toured for only about 1.5 hours but definitely a place you could spend 3-5 hours",
          "It is a great place to visit, better on Sunday after 3 pm the entry is free. Here you could have a lot of things from Picasso and the famous Guernica.",
          ".....I respect every work. Guernica is moving. Located in a fun town square abounding with restaurants.",
          "here too we chose the free option - tickets are free 2 hours before closure. we too a map of the museum while waiting so we could plan the visit and chose to see just the 2nd floor",
          "Wonderful museum. The epic Guarnica is housed here. Get to the museum early (or buy tickets ahead of time). By 1PM there was a line snaking around the plaza. There was so much to see my wife and I did not get to the new installations after 3.5 hours. Highly recommended.",
          "Reina Sofia is a very famous museum of modern art, you will find a lot of Picasso's works there. The area around is also nice",
          "There are so many Picasso's here - including arguably his most famous/prominent work Guernica. Head to the second floor and if you have time then do the 1st floor, Serra and garden and any others following that.",
          "We visited the three main art museums in Madrid using the art pass. This was worthwhile, but not our favorite.",
          "If you want to see Picaso's Guernica you mustn't miss the opportunity to visit. Less crowded that the Prado, and cheaper too. Being over 65 ( with proof) I was free of charge. Plenty to see.",
          "We visit on 12 October, Spanish National Day, when entry was free all day. We expected the Museum to be crowded, but although there was a queue for entry we were in within 10 minutes. This is a collection of mainly modern art and we were impressed with the way items were",
          "I decided to finally visit the Museum of Reina Sofia and It did not disappoint. I bought a ticket to skip the line without knowing that the free entrance was on Sunday but still I am glad I did because I was able to skip the long line. If you are a lover of modern art then this",
          "We were sorry we wasted time visiting this museum which seemed to be focused more on the history of the Spanish Civil War than modern art. Most of the galleries were devoted to pointless video displays - we much preferred the Thyssen gallery which was excellent.",
          "Went to the art museum on a Sunday whern entry is free. We really went to see Picasso's Guernica (which was huge and amazing) however there is lots of fabulous art in this museum and it is well worth a visit. It was relatively crowded - not sure if that was due to the free",
          "Worth a trip to see Guernica! Wow plus Picasso and Dali works. Sunday is free for senior citizens. No lines and lots of space to enjoy the art. The rooms are a bit confusing to navigate.",
          "The Reina Sophia not only presents a wonderful collection of modern art but tells a history of Spain - particularly the period of the revolution. A must see in Madrid!",
          "I was not feeling well when we visited which is a pity as normally I would have been in fits of laughter at some of the pretentious so called art work on view. I love some modern art and the Picasso\u2019s and Dalis were definitely worth seeing, especially the early Dali paintings",
          "locates near the station of Atocha. Every Sunday afternoon there is visit for free. World famous pairings inside, definitely worth for a visit.",
          "Always wanted to see the Guernica from picasso, and it did not disappoint, a museum very much worth a visit, very decent entry fee of E 10",
          "I visited on a Friday mid-afternoon and bought tickets online to skip the queue - to arrive and discover that there isn\u2019t any queue at all. I covered the whole place, including the garden and souvenir shop in one and half hours. I didn\u2019t carry an audio phone which provides",
          "I am not really a fan of modern art (more a classical person). That said, this museum does contain a number of important pieces: Guernica obviously, but also interesting works by Dali, Miro, etc. I did tour the whole collection, but passed by certain rooms quite quickly due to",
          "Very affordable size museum with nice art pieces all around, a must do visit for any Madrid visitor.",
          "An incredible museum of contemporary art where you can see, among thousands of works, the magnificent expression of art against fascist oppression and against the war that always triggers, the \"Guernica\" by Pablo Picasso. An essential work for any lover of art and people's",
          "We spent two hour visiting the second-floor 20th Century collection which includes works by Dali, Miro and Picasso. Don't miss Guernica.",
          "Excellent museum with fantastic paintings of Dalli, Miro, Picasso & many more. One of the fascinating parts of it is the famous Guernica! Be ready to spend at least 2 hours from your program.",
          "This museum was so expansive and captivating that I visited twice (and had to stand in a long queue the rain to get in the second time!). Guernica will bring you to your knees.",
          "Altough I wanted to go because of Picasso's|Gurnica (went back 5 times to see it) This museum opened our eyes to modern art and the art of the spanish revolution.",
          "Lots of contemporary Art. Picasso and the Guernica is a must see. The Miro's and some Dal's are there too. Liked it a lot",
          "It is hard to take in all that this museum holds in just one visit. The most famous Picasso, Guernica, is alone worth the trip. There are many contemporary paintings, books, posters, and pictures that are fascinating. I would go back many times if I had the chance.",
          "My husband and I enjoyed our visit to this incredibly beautiful museum which holds Guernica by Picasso as one of its most memorable pieces.This museum graciously offers free admission to seniors,children,the unemployed,immigrants and several other groups of individuals.The",
          "Enjoyed seeing artwork by masters of modern Spanish art! Loved a quiet moment in garden with the Alexander Caulder sculpture. Particularly awed by Picasso's \"Guernica\". Also enjoyed the senior discounted fee!",
          "I had lost a bit of my memory of the museum during those years. This visit brought back many. One in particular, a painting of the artist who is killed in a car crash. He looks good in death in the painting, only really to be killed in real life a few weeks later in a car",
          "If you love modern art , go for it. Guernica painting could have had a more informative presentation",
          "Not as good as The Prado, but certainly enjoyable for folks that enjoy art. Could be better organized as so far as flow from room to room.",
          "We visited the Reina Sofia on one of the free evening slots and spent a couple of hours looking at the wonderful art. Guernica is of course the highlight but there is enough art in the gallery to keep you entertained for hours.",
          "There were many paintings and exhibitions pertaining to Spanish history from the Spanish Civil War to the present. Picasso\u2019s La Guernica, powerful painting of the devastation of the Civil War is housed in this museum. They have a lovely courtyard to sit in.",
          "Again I'm not a museum person, but I enjoyed this one also. Not your usual museum, there are some interesting and thought provoking exhibits.",
          "If you're interested in modern art this is the museum to visit in Madrid, there was an exhibition by American artist David Wojnarowicz when we visited which was vast and which was my favourite part, some of the temporary exhibitions on the upper floors were not really my cup of",
          "Nice building with lots of art to see. It's certainly an experience butI fail to see how the majority of the exhibits can be considered art. I accept that a lot of people will appreciate its exhibits but not me.",
          "Not a fan of modern art. Went to see Picasso's Guernica. Kind of a rambling building. Some works seem dated and/or need more context. Some of the early Dali's were interesting. Like I said, not a fan of modern art but the visit was still enjoyable.",
          "We visit the Reina Sofia every time we are in Madrid. They have great exhibitions and standing in front of Picasso's Guernica never gets old. However, I would like to point out the fact that it is extremely disorganized in terms of the experience for the visitor. A few examples:",
          "The major art piece of the museum, Guernica from Picasso, justifies the visit. Many other great masterpieces in a museum made of two nice buildings. I would recommend the audio-guide to be sure to understand some complicated pieces of contemporary art.",
          "Went there on a recent trip to Mardrid. the museum is huge with great works of art. One could spend days here. Was expecially good for me because i went on a day when they don't charge entrance fee.",
          "This is primarily a modern art museum with interesting displays of different art forms including sculpture, film , photography, etc. Some of it was enjoyable but some displays I found to be kind of vulgar and not to my liking.",
          "Not given the sort of hype and reputation some of the other Madrid museums get but I don't see why - this was the best one we visited. Not only was the building itself impressive, the varying exhibits meant there was a large variety of things to see. Even if some of the",
          "This is a large museum in a very modern facility. The art displayed was very artsy and beyond our comprehension. (4 seniors 65+) The walk through was easy with spacious rooms.",
          "Great collection of Spanish art including Picasso's Guernica which is a 'must see' for anyone interested in the work of Pablo Picasso. I would have rated it more highly if we hadn't had difficulty in finding our way around this relatively recently converted hospital. The art is",
          "The building is amazing the art I\u2019m not sure about. If your over 65 show your ID and you\u2019re in for free, I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t pay.",
          "Apart from Picasso's powerful and astonishing Guernica (and associated paintings and drawings) there is a wonderful eclectic mix of modern art in this beautiful museum. Too much to see in one day and set out contextually rather than by artist, so can be difficult to find",
          "Great collection of art with a lot of well thought out collections. Weather outside was atrocious and we had not pre-purchased a ticket but arrived early to avoid lines and to enjoy the exhibits.",
          "I have to say we are not modern art people usually, but it was a very rainy day so we came to visit and enjoyed ourselves generally. We enjoyed the second floor the most with the Dali, Picasso and other modern artists. Some of the other floors left us a little perplexed but I",
          "Have to admit I struggle with this period of art but it is beautifully laid out and, of course, Guernica has got to be seen. It is not just the painting that moves and impresses but the adjoining rooms with the photo exhibition of the different stages of its creation, the films",
          "Suggest if you want to visit quickly you go straight to the fourth floor to see the Picasso and see the rest at leisure. The Dali paintings are also worth a view",
          "Very good gallery in a stunning building (it used to be a hospital). Has works by Dali, Picasso and other famous artists. Very worthwhile. Be aware that photographs are not permitted in certain rooms.",
          "This is one of the Museums you should visit when you go to Madrid. In between the works of art there, there is a Picasso you have to see and admire.",
          "I love to visit Sof\u00eda museum whenever I can. Visits at 2 last hours are free admission, with this time you will be able to see the most important painting... For example Guernica by Picasso... Must see!",
          "The only thing good was they admitted seniors for free! Except for a few artists you never heard of the others and all the movies were in Spanish with Spanish subtitles! The staff was also too overbearing...we couldn\u2019t wait to leave...and I am an artist!",
          "Excellent collection of 20th century art\u2013 worth a visit just to see \u201cGuernica\u201d, but lots of other important works in the collection as well, by all of the major 20th-century Spanish artists including Picasso, Dali, Miro, Julio Gonzalez, Chillida, etc. Modern artists from other",
          "Best experience this time in Madrid. The Guernica is worth the entrance fee alone. But make sure to see level 4 and 2, then you get the main works of the collection. Fantastic - Dali, Miro, Leger, Picasso - whats not to love.",
          "There were several paintings I had wanted to see for many years. Overall I found the tone quite depressing. The period of the Spanish Civil War and the era that followed were terrible for the Spanish people.",
          "I went with a view to seeing the masterpiece by Picasso and was not disappointed and amazed by the scale and detail. Worth the entrance fee on its own.",
          "The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda or Sof\u00eda Reina Museum is most prominently known for housing Picasso\u2019s, 1937 masterpiece, \u201cGuernica\u201d, which in shades of grey captures the horror and suffering of war for man and animal alike. This painting alone is worth the modest",
          "I'd wanted to see Guernica in person for many, many years and we took the chance to enjoy that masgerpiece, plus others, on a drizzly Madrid morning. The collection of 20th century art is superb. The room full of Miro lets you appreciate his development as an artist, and there",
          "We visited the Reina Sofia later in the afternoon, so the crowds were minimal. We started with the special exhibit from an American artist from the 1980s. It was filled with a lot of angry art, appropriate given the turbulence of the times. We also saw Guernica, which was",
          "If art museums are of interest, visiting Madrid without having spent time at Reina Sofia would be a significant missed opportunity. Picasso's Guernica, Miro, Dali and so many others. Very interesting and moving current exhibits; simply terrific. We'd heard so much about",
          "Due to time constraints, we headed immediately to the Guernika rooms. The main attraction is very well displayed with many relevant artworks, sketches, contemporary photographs. It is incredibly powerful. The museum is free for the last 2 hrs of opening each day but there are",
          "This had been on my bucket list for sometime as I wanted to see Guernica. As luck would have it, I had it to myself. My only criticism is I do not seek Spanish(!) so that I could not fully benefit from what is clearly a very well thought out and laid out collection. The building",
          "Whether you are a fan of modern/contemporary art or not it is worth visiting for Guernica alone. If that is all you want to see, then you can enter for free from 7.00pm, but it really is worth planning a longer visit.",
          "No bad words for the works on display, but the organization and especially the signposts are very poor .... it's even hard to find the exit. Also: erratic elevators.",
          "Almost all the art in this museum is the type of art that has little artistic talent but a lot of explanation, hidden meaning, and pseudointelectual BS behind it. One artist took apart a computer keyboard and displayed its pieces. That\u2019s it. Another had black and white photos of",
          "We saw Gurnica here and other great pieces by Salvador Dali, definitely worth a visit! Also some strange exhibits but it was all part of the experience.",
          "Since our visit to the Reina Sofia in August it's become a family in-joke. If we come across anyone unpleasant, or rude, or poor customer service, we look at each other and say \"maybe they should apply for the Reina Sofia\" Deeply unfriendly and aggressive guards overshadow your",
          "Being a tourist attraction visitors should be the focus and should be treated with some courtesy. This is not clearly what happens in this museum where security guards have no manners, treat visitors without regard and are very rude.",
          "Very well organised, light and on the whole welcoming, but very few if not no possibilities to sit and admire the exhibits which makes the visit for the less mobile a challenge. I am not too much into modern art ...",
          "I like some modern art...but most of the art here was too far out. Some things looked as if they could have been done by a three year old.",
          "Guernica is the centerpiece here, and rightfully so. There are some other interesting pieces here, but if you are short on time, you can skip most of it aside from Guernica.",
          "Sadly, we are not art lovers who know everything about art. Anyway, we wanted to see Gernica. We could appreciate the art, but something was missing. Our guide in Prado Museum told us that sometimes is better to hire a guide in the contemporary arts museum rather than the",
          "The entrance I went in was not in the main building but that was not made clear. It also meant that I used a different bag storage which was not made clear so I found it hard to find at the end. Again I read not offered the chance to have an audio tour as it read not the main",
          "The Reina Sofia ia one of Madrid's \"big three\" art galleries, housing a wonderful collection of art from around the 1920s onwards. Its permanent collection is Spanish-centred, but the temporary exhibitions are very international. The organisation of the collection is very",
          "This museum had a modest collection of 19th and 20th century primarily Spanish art. It's collection was quite frankly underwhelming. The building is beautiful though and the rooms were peaceful. This is worth seeing but will pale in comparison to the Thyssen. Of the museums",
          "I was drawn to the works here of Picasso and Dahli. The museum is well laid out and not overly crowded. Good facilities and easily accessible. I found the layout a little muddled but still enjoyable. They have free wifi and a lovely internal outdoor area.",
          "An absolutely amazing collection of modern art, including Picasso's Guernica (and several of his preparatory sketches for it). Vast number of works by Spanish artists, including a good selection from the Spanish Republic. Don't miss the huge Calder in the courtyard (and other",
          "Museo Nacional Centro de Reina Sofia excels in its sober grandeur. Part of Madrid\u2019s busy museum scene, a visit to this site is must if you\u2019re interested in art.

          "This is the modern art museum of Madrid and is a 10 minute walk down the road from the Prado. It it home to Picassos Guernica- perhaps his most famous painting depicting the Spanish Civil War. This was the reason for my visit although I did also take in some of the other",
          "I was staying at a hotel about 1-1/2 miles away and decided to check this out. It's a former hospital. The collection is mixed; a few excellent pieces and a lot of other pieces not so great. The layout is very confusing given the former hospital use of the building.",
          "I am not much of a museum person and chose this one as my only Madrid museum. And I managed to stay for 1,5 hours and enjoyed some of the painting. I found the waymarking chaotic and never found some of the places I was looking for. But the paintings are well presented. What I",
          "Really loved this museum. They had artwork by Dal\u00ec, Picasso, ... Picasso\u2019s Guernica is in this museum. They also have exhibitions with modern art. The last 2 hours of the day it is free to go inside",
          "Our bike tour guide recommended a visit to this museum but mentioned that it opened for two hours free several days of the week. Check out those hours to see if they suit you before you visit. Lots of good art here including Picasso\u2019s Guernica, this viewing room gets very busy!",
          "We only had a day in Madrid and wanted to view Picasso's Guernica. A huge painting. Also viewed other Picassos and works by Dali. We were time limited so viewed what we needed to. Free entry for over 65s if you produce passport. Lifts to move between floors, spacious. Do visit.",
          "This museum is where you can find the works by Picasso, Miro, Dali, and many others. Guernika is here, and it\u2019s amazing. I recommend paying for the guided tour to get the most out of your visit.",
          "This is an incredible modern art museum in a beautiful building. We started on the 4th floor and worked our way down. If short for time just go to the 2nd floor particularily room 206 to see Picassos masterpiece \"Guernica\" you will not be disappointed. Paying the entry fee just",
          "Went there to see Picasso's Guernica and it didn't disappoint. Amazing work of art and learned so much about the history behind the piece. Also had other more modern work of Picasso (we liked this museum better than the Picasso museum in Barcelona which we also visited) and",
          "Much more focused on modern and contemporary art than the Prado. The place is big so there\u2019s loads to see. Can be quite crowded. Best strategy is to figure out beforehand on what you\u2019re most interested in and focus on those things.",
          "I bought the ticket in advance and went there on the day I booked Nobody was checking the ticket. The collection was ok but bit disappointed but good space to spend a few hours during hot sweaty day.",
          "Well the highlight was seeing, and reading more about, Guernica but the whole museum made me want more information and understanding of the works and the socio-political history.",
          "Such a great museum, it was small but beautiful. Well organised and easy to walk around and after there\u2019s a coffee shop which is very nice.",
          "We had a 3 museum pass that included this museum. The museum has several Picasso pieces including the breathtaking Guernica. If you are a fan of Dal\u00ed as well, this museum is worth the price of admission.",
          "Scheduled lunch at the Arzabal Restaurant at 1:30pm on Sunday afternoon before entering the museum. The restaurant is located at the side of the Reina Sofia. Sat in the garden and enjoyed croquette appetizers/ calamari/ followed by a wonderful tuna tartare. Our fantastic",
          "This museum alone is worth the trip to Madrid - in addition to major works like Picasso's Guernica there is an astonishing amount of modern art on display from around the world - more than can be consumed in one trip. Great cafe on the lower level of the old building to rest and",
          "Did this museum after doing the Prado the previous day and enjoyed it more, loved seeing Picasso\u2019s Guernica lots of Dali\u2019s Miro\u2019s and a lot of others I had not heard of. Got the audio guide and found it very useful, would recommend it. Bought the tickets online the day before",

          "I was walking around in Madrid one evening and realized that people were lining up outside Reina Sophia Museum. They provide free entry during the last couple of hours every day. So I went in, and it was a great use of two hours. I saw masterpieces by Dali, Picasso, Miro,",
          "Spent 7 hours at the gallery, starting in the new section. The art on display, including special collections was incredible. I left wondering what has humanity learnt about the destruction that war brings and the upheaval of the worlds people??? Nothing, but it is the art and",
          "A little bit of everything - classics, modern, a library, courtyards - modern and traditional, cool new building. The audio guide is well worth it. And it's not as crowded.",

          "Great collection of cubism, especially Picasso and Gris, and surrealism (including Dali, of course). The museum's highlight is definitely Picasso's Guernica \u2013 even if you've seen photos of it, nothing compares to the experience and drama that the sheer size of the real painting",
          "Interesting building structure. Everyone recommended this museum more than others. It\u2019s very good, definitely plan for more than 1/2 day if you want to see everything.",
          "Nice museum but you really do have to love modern art to enjoy this. They have the big names like Picasso and Dali but some of the art from more recent years gets pretty unusual!",
          "We got in line at 6:30 for the free hours between 7-9 (not sure if this is every day or not), and were able to spent 2 hours roaming the museum and we loved it. Great exhibits, loved the layout. Really wonderful way to spend a couple hours.",
          "The museum opens at 10am and on Wednesday, when I went, the line was already quite long! Luckily I bought the Paseo del Arte Card online which meant I could skip the lines. If you are already planning to go to La Reina Sofia, El Prado, and Thyssen-Bornemisza, then the value is",
          "If you had to visit only one art museum in Madrid, this is a best bet - but as world-wide museums go, it's only average, so don't visit with great expectations. However, it is worthwhile to visit, if only to view the magnificent 'Guernica' - which is sited in a gallery that is",
          "This four-story museum holds plenty of important art work. If you are into art, you\u2019ll certainly appreciate the many works here. If you\u2019re not that into art, this is still a great place to walk through for an hour or two on a really hot day to escape the heat and absorb some",
          "The Reina Sofia holds Picasso's Guernica and has in adjacent rooms contextualises the painting with exhibitions on the Spanish Civil War in various media.",
          "If you like modern art, you will love this museum! We spent over two hours there and could easily have spent twice that amount of time.",
          "There was no line to buy tickets mid-day on a Saturday. The museum generously provides free tickets to students. It was well worth it to purchase an audio guide as well! The majority of the collection is on the second floor (Guernica, Dali\u2019s \u201cThe Masturbator\u201d, etc), with only",
          "The Guernica is the main attraction of the Reina Sofia and the art gallery feels nicely themed around this central piece. Featuring work predominantly just before, during and just after Pablo Picasso's work it gives a great insight into the art landscape at this time allowing",
          "It is a shame that to have restriction to take photos in 2nd floor. Most of the good artworks from Dali, Picasso and Miro are on the 2nd floor. Science and art are not monopolized by anyone.",
          "Some excellent and particular works of art. You need to be aware that this is curated to explain different concepts such as 'surrealism'. So the first rooms are essential. Yes you move on the Guernica and this has a special place that really helps to put it into context. we",
          "Unique choice of art to display, not far from other museums. spend a lovely afternoon there, then rest with evening beverages before heading back to your hotel.",
          "Si no tienes mucho tiempo, ve al museo, contempla el Guernica y eso es m\u00e1s que suficiente. If you do not have much time, go to the museum, see Guernica and that is more than enough.",
          "This is a great collection of modern art. Definitley a great complement to the Prado which has more traditional art. Definitely worth seeing!",
          "Amazing building housing a truly great collection. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and by chance found that it was free after 13:30. There was a bit of a queue but it cleared within 10 minutes, so really worth the wait. I will be back!",
          "This is a very large art museum that is a must-see for people who enjoy modern and contemporary art. It was quite interesting to see early works by artists such as Picasso, Dali and Miro and how their artistic style evolved over time. The art is housed in two buildings. I was",
          "If you are a lover of modern art, you may want to dedicate almost a full day to this museum. We spent about 2 1/2 hours and that was not nearly enough. Yes, there is the \"war\" room, including Guernica but that is only a small part.. Historical modern pieces which you've",
          "I went to this museum to see the Guernica masterpiece by Picasso. Usually, I am not much of a museum person, but this museum is the home of some of the finest works of Picasso and Dali. Adding to that is the building\u2019s past as a hospital. All in all, a good experience and if you",
          "My husband and I went to both Prado and Sofia on the same day. We enjoyed both museums, but Sofia was a particular favorite. The collection was not huge, but perfectly selected. Spend a few hours wandering through this great museum if you find yourself in Madrid. Be warned",
          "Took the family for a quick visit to see the War collection I including Guernica. Went after 7pm for free!",
          "A talented artist, photographer, poet, writer and activist. Worth the visit. Also saw Picasso's, Dali's, etc.",
          "An important museum of modern art. It houses, amongst others, works by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali, including the famous Guernica. The museum comprises two buildings that communicate with each other. Generally photos are allowed except for the area where the Guernica is",
          "Another incredible art museum in Madrid. You can\u2019t miss this one! Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica,\u201d alone, is worth the visit.",
          "This was possibly too modern by my tastes, no easy stuff like Hockney, too much on the later Picasso and installations ie a rectangle of tiles placed on the floor. Tip for seniors, free entry if you have photo idea with date of birth. Lifts terrifying if you do not like",
          "Dali, Miro, Picasso...and countless other significant pieces to see, the Reina is a great way to spend a day. The permanent collection alone is worth it. Then add some of the temporary exhibits and you\u2019ll walk away sated.",
          "Don\u2019t miss it! We enjoyed the Reina Sofia so much more than our visit to the Louvre in Paris. Less crowded, nice air conditioning, and thought provoking art. Also there are some very nice spots for pictures in the hallway around the central courtyard, and the stone stairwells.",
          "La Guernica. Grim, gray, glorious in the Picasso sense of the word. Go here just to see this work.The fragmented image of a mother holding her dead child will haunt me forever. I question the gift shop for selling La Guernica mugs.",
          "The Reina Sofia really is a one trick pony. Mind you, that trick - Picasso\u2019s Guernica - is a hell of a trick. This is one impressive, challenging piece of art that everyone should see - even if you are put off by the thought of abstract art. My tip is just pay the entry price,",
          "centrally located, easy to walk through, nicely set up, beautiful art, modern, trendy, providing you with some very nice terraces in the surroundings... do you need more reasons to visit this museum? :)",
          "This is the mos visited museum in Madrid, no wonder why! Full of very interesing, delicate, excentric and beautiful paintings and sculputures.. Don't miss El Guernica when you go.",
          "Loved this place. Great value to see some incredible artwork and fascinating exhibitions. Highly recommended.",
          "Art galleries are a bit like churches - this one has signs up telling visitors to be quiet, although I am pretty sure the paintings don\u2019t care and I\u2019m not sure that reverence and piety were qualities that figured high on the list of artistic values celebrated by the Dadaists or",
          "Although not a fan of Modern Art I really enjoyed the Reina Sofia. There was such a wide variety of modern art that I found quite a few pieces to admire. Of course the \u201cpiece de resistance\u201d of the museum is Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d (seeing it is worth the cost of the entrance fee)",
          "We visited on Sunday which is free. TIP: Don't queue at the main entrance! There is a side entrance with no queue in the older part of the building. (They scan your bags at security.) TIP: Don't take pictures of the indoors exhibits! They tell you off for that. There are plenty",
          "Fabulous collection that needs to be enjoyed while visiting Madrid. Allow at least 3 hours to tour. Great gift shop.",
          "The place was practically empty and it felt we had it to ourselves. We had a wonderful local guide. The Guernica is a must see.",
          "Reina Sofia is free from 7 pm to 9 pm and expectedly there was a line to get in. However, it moved very fast and there was no rush as such. Don't miss Picasso's Guernica and the works of Salvador Dali.",
          "This exhibit was very crowded, but people managed to move along so others could see it and the different materials on display regarding the order of the painting, letters exchanged regarding the places it was displayed around the world, etc.",
          "We came here to see Picasso's Guernica and were not disappointed. The rest of the museum is dominated, as one would expect, by modern Spanish art and as such we found it rather hard work. There was also a lack of interpretive material and good English translations. It was",
          "It is mainly dedicated to Spanish modern paintings. Apart from Picaso occupying the place of its own, works of Braque, Kandinsky, Rivera, Klee and several other modernists are presented. Temporary exhibitions of great artistic content is a plus to visit this museum.",
          "This was a surprise. Very easy to get around it and so much to see. Lots of photography mixed in with paintings. Great little restaurant for lunch too.",
          "We visited on a mid Sunday afternoon and while entry was free - we were told only 2 floors of exhibits were open. First floor was a complete waste of time. Did enjoy some of the second floor exhibits- including Picasso\u2019s Guernica & a few pieces by Salvador Dali.",
          "Unlike the Prado, this museum had no lines. Very easy to get around. Glass elevators get you from one floor to the next. Some rather dark and graphic art is featured. May be offensive to some. Would not recommend taking children here.",
          "The Reina Sofia Museum has Picasso's Guernica and much more! It's a 15-minute walk downhill from The Prado. go visit!",
          "The Reina Sofia is a top class museum housing a variety of contemporary art. However, it is a bit confusing to get your bearings. I purposefully started at the top and worked my way down which gave me a chance to get used to the map and come up with a system of checking off the",
          "This is a great museum. Seniors with a passport are admitted free. We arrived At 9:15 AM but the crowds did not start to form until a half-hour later. The famous Picasso painting, Guernica, (no photos allowed) is here. I suggest you start with the permanent collection, rather",
          "I'm intrigued by the reviewer who said to combine this visit with the Prado as when I visited they were not open on the same day. I have heard you can purchase a combined ticket (although I didn't). The museum itself isn't an example of dazzling contemporary architecture like",
          "It is a pity that this national museum presenting so many masterpieces is so poorly organized It was really frustrating and exhausting to try to locate the pictures that we were interested in",
          "Examples of Spanish modern art, Includes Picasso, Dali, and Miro as well as other artists. The star of the exhibit is Guernica. Very close to the Prado. so it can be combined with a visit to the Prado, This is worth a visit.",
          "Large institution with immense resources; traces through modern art history weaving a great understanble history of the progression of history and the evolution of each era of painters. Helped a lot by a small group tour by Amigo. Guide was a young Italian woman living in",
          "We have visited Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia two or three times over the last few years, during visits to Spain. However this time around we had more time and were able to spend longer inside the museum. So we can now say that this is a really great museum with some",
          "Just one word: Guernica. Picasso's work will leave you in tears. In addition to this, an exciting program of temporal exhibitions",
          "I am glad we went to see Guernica and the museum grounds but overall this museum wasn\u2019t worth the entry fee for me. My opinion is definitely based on the fact I don\u2019t love modern art. I\u2019m sure others would really enjoy it. The museum wasn\u2019t particularly engaging for my children",
          "This Art Gallery has free entry from 7-9 pm, every day. So we queued , by 6.40pm, when the line was not too long. It was worth it to see \u201cGuernica\u201d. An amazing painting that depicts the horror of war. It is huge , and we just stood and looked . Also, viewed lots of other",
          "While in Madrid went the museum after 7 pm when it was free. Other than its easy to get lost it is a wonderful museum. The art is more modern than the Prada. You have Picasso Miro Dali Calder. Very nice.",
          "Collection was very modern. We came here to see Guernica of Pablo Picasso. It was also nice to see Salvador Dali\u2019s works. I\u2019m not a big fan of modern art but it was interesting, other\u2019s I found too dark. But go see the huge Guernica! Can\u2019t take a photo of it; instead a took",
          "When you marvel at the Guernica, one\u2019s reason for visiting Madrid is confirmed. The collection of cubist work is vast and evocative. I only had 90 minutes and it was worth the rush.",
          "My main reason for going here was to see Picasso's justifiably famous war painting \"Guernica\". There is much else to see at the 'Reina', but this painting, which takes up an entire gallery, brings up emotions and pity like few others I have seen. There are thousands or",
          "After a weekend of soccer at the Champions, great place to visit, the Cubist and Surrealist section is outstanding. Beyond Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d, the collection of Dali\u2019s, Bracque\u2019s and Miro\u2019s is breathtaking!, worths every hour!",
          "It is always a pleasure to come to Madrid and visit Reina Sofia! It is always calm and easy to visit the rooms full of beautiful and great art! As well as the garden. Masters like Picasso, Dali, Mir\u00f3 and Juan Gris are there with their unique talent. The Guernica from Pablo",
          "What can I say, I was wowed by the collection and truly enjoyed the modern art as well as the masters. Wonder the rooms or go with a plan as I did but be prepared to depart from your scheduled route as pieces catch your eye. A beautiful building and fun elevators to ride on",
          "On a Thursday in mid-May, my wife and I spent a little over two hours visiting this museum while on a quick visit to Madrid as we headed west to begin walking El Camino. We arrived at the museum a little after 11:00, got in line to buy Paseo de Arte passes, and five minutes",
          "Interesting collection with a Spanish focus. Quite a fun selection of modern art juxtaposed with some quite dark glimpses at social revolution in the last century. If I had to choose one museum to visit in Madrid this would be it. Reina Sofia is a great compliment to the Prado\u2019s",
          "Prado takes you from the great masters to Picasso, and Regina Sofia takes the relay, bringing you from Picasso, Goya, Dali and Miro into touching today's artists. If I have to chose, I'd still go to Prado, but I would still say you should do both.",
          "We got in for free because of our age. Some good Picasso's. Worth it to see Guernica. Choose what you want to see.",
          "Madrid has at least two massive art museums and this requires just as much time as the Prado to do it justice. The highlight is definitely the magnificent and iconic Guernica, but there are plenty of other modernist masters too, including a range of surrealists. The garden",
          "Not the space and modernity of Museo del Prado but worth to visit. An old house converted to museum. Best to see was the Guernica and the Dali initial work. We had a good time.",
          "Excellent collection of modernists, especially Picasso. Exhibits are easy to follow without a guide. Worth the walk to get there.",
          "A good modern art museum, but not many signs in English. Building is a little confusing to navigate.",
          "Guernica was our highlight, but there were so many other paintings we enjoyed very much. I especially liked seeing so many paintings by Joan Miro! Overall, it is an amazing museum.",
          "Powerful visual record of events and artistic life in Spain in modern times. Posters, photos and newsreels coverng the Spanish civil war, and Picasso's paintings now returned to Spain. Also many beautiful Joan Mir\u00f3 paintings. Various items from the Spanish pavillion at the",
          "Home of some classic work including Picasso\u2019s Guernica. It is probably the reason a lot of people come to this museum(including my family). It is in gallery on the second floor. No pictures are allowed within that gallery. Not as crazy as the Mona Lisa, but still crowded. Well",
          "Lots of works by the more famous Spanish artists of Dali. Picasso, Man Rey and Joan Miro. Only managed 2 floors of 5 as museumed out.",
          "It was a very special experience to stand before Picasso\u2019s masterpiece, something on my bucket list. It did not disappoint! We pre booked tickets which were very reasonably priced, but found that arriving at opening time we beat the crowds. This museum is big and has a",
          "This was the highlight of our trip to Madrid. If you're a fan of Picasso and Dali then this is a must; the exhibition contains some of their greatest works. The massive painting that is Guernica, stands out although like all 'great' paintings a viewing of this was difficult",
          "I have to admit that I don't really admire the cubizm style. But even so - I saw many intersting and beatiful art pieces.",
          "It is a small museum, with an interesting collection of modern and contemporary art. But I went there to see Picasso's Guernica. This is something for everyone to see before dying. And not only once...",
          "We were there at opening time and left just before 1500. There was so much to see..not only in quantity but in variety. You can photograph without flash everywhere except Rooms 206.and I man rooms as there are several bays under the general Room 206. If you go to the cafe you",
          "Okay, here\u2019s the deal...take this with a grain of salt. I have been to 79 countries and seen a lot of museums and antiquities. I am sort of hard to impress. This is no Louvre. It was just okay. I am mean really just okay. the only reason I went was for the temporary exist on the",
          "Before going into this museum I had taken an interesting picture on the street and wanted to use the WiFi in the museum to send it to my friend. One of the ladies watching the exhibits was ABSOLUTELY RUDE AND WAS HARASSING ME about me having my cellphone out. Even though I",
          "Guernica is a must see as well as other Picasso and Dali exhibits. We also liked the French dauphin' s fine china and and glass collection.",
          "Picasso Dali and the famous painting Guernica, the Picasso masterpiece. Don't miss it. The building is great too used to be in hospital.",
          "One of the big three Madrid museums of art. Having visited the nearby Thyssen-Bornemisza museum two days previously it was interesting to compare the two. They are different with Sofia\u2019 more focus on contemporary art - cubism, Impressionism- compared to the Thyssen art",
          "A must must see -- there is so much more to be explored in this museum than generally described. If you love cubism, surreal, and impressionistic art (among other \"modern\" forms), plan the better part of a day here.",
          "It took a couple of tries but we finally got into this fine museum. The day we planned to visit it was closed because of the Feast Day of St. Isidro the patron saint of Madrid. The museum is well laid out and easy to get around. Of course, the main attraction is Guernica. There",
          "We visited the Sofia Reina and went to see Picasso's Guernica. It did not disappoint. It is well worth going just to see this one, large, notable painting. We bought tickets ahead of time and had no wait to get in to the museum. We did the audio tour. The audio guide is",
          "A very reasonably priced entrance fee. We saw many famous works of art such as the Clothed Maja and the Naked Maja. Also the very famous Guernica by Picasso. A large group of schoolchildren and many others prevented me from viewing it in one go. I had to move around the room",
          "The permanent collection (with Guernica) has to be on any art lover's \"must do\" list. However, we found the temporary exhibit (Rogelio Lopez Cuenca when we were there) lacking in both style and substance. But if you stick with the tried and true (Picasso, Goya, Dali, etc.) you",
          "I love modern art and found this collection largely flat and uninteresting. On top of that the building is huge but not easy to navigate. You often get confused as to where you are and what galleries you might have missed. There even are times you can't figure out how to get out.",
          "The space itself perhaps not the most approachable, hence four rather than five stars, feels somewhat claustrophobic, over-media-ed. Doesn't matter, Guernica is here, and is more moving now, with the world as it is, than one may be prepared for. What an experience, to stand in",
          "The Reina Sofia Museum has Picasso's Guernica and much more! It's a 15-minute walk downhill from The Prado. Modern art, including what some call the most dramatic anti-war painting in history, Picasso's Guernica.",
          "Went just to see Guernica (which was reason enough and well worth the visit just for that), but loved most of the museum. Very good examples not just of Picasso but his greatest contemporaries too.",
          "Excellent museum, well situated with a great display of pictures in a most pleasant environment. Needs at least a day.",
          "We wanted to get a ticket for the next day and then we were told that there is free entry because of the int. day of museums - and this a day in advance. So we have enjoyed Picasso's, Miro's and Dali's art completely for free. Guernica (you CANNOT take pictures) was on my bucket",
          "What can I say? I had read and learned about Guernica from an art history class some 40 years ago in high school. But seeing the painting in person...wow! What a privilege. I went late in the day on a weekday in May and there was no line to buy a ticket. One can take",
          "We visited first thing on a Thursday morning shortly after 10 am. The queue was short and the galleries not crowded. We went straight to room 206 to see Guernica and had all the time we needed to view and contemplate on this important piece of art. The exhibits in this building",
          "We recently spent six days in Bilbao. Our planes were to visit Gernika to see any of the memorials to the bombing and ended up going a second time to wander through the Monday Market. It's an easy and inexpensive bus ride from Bilbao on a public bus which makes scheduled runs",
          "We visited the museum with a combined ticket for Prado and Thyssen Bornemisza There is a large presence of work of Miro, Dali and Picasso We were quite impressed by the Picasso masterpiece Guernica Nice museum and close to the Atocha station",
          "Loved seeing all of the famous artists works that I have learned about in school. I really liked the Reina because it was a much more casual museum compared to the Prado and pictures are allowed in most of the rooms which is really nice. If you are a student make sure to have",
          "Another world class art museum in Madrid that shouldn't be missed , especially if you are a lover of fine art. Well layed out collection. Go off peak season if possible to really enjoy the masterpieces.",
          "Not been yet to Prado ! but this one is incredible. Must see the Guernica of Picasso ! fantastic. Madrid has the largest pinacotheque in the world",
          "The place is huge and has an amazing park with calder sculptures. Really beautiful. 4 floors of art. You can find guernica if you follow the masses. However, there are a lot of exhibitions worth visiting about the history of spain reflected in art. I like modern art and was an",
          "Everything here was just horrible i mean those art were just funny and horrible ! i recommend to skip this place.",
          "Guernica is indeed amazing, by Ita size and context but you will ver plenty of master pieces to see. If you also like Goya and Salvador Dali, this os The place. Good guide too. Not to be missed!",
          "I've been to a modern art museum before and absolutely loved it!! This place was awful...it was exhausting to say the least. It was a huge space with no lighting or windows and extremely disorganised. A complete waist of time and your valuable tourist time is better off used",
          "The modern art collection is one of the best in Europe and the audio guided tour is worth every Euro. Make sure you have enough time to linger in front of Guernica, which inspires from every angle.",
          "Of course we came for Guernica, but apart from that didn't see much interesting. Just a few Dalis, Picassos and Miros. Sunday afternoon free though, so no complaints\ud83d\ude09",
          "Qeeen Sofia\u2019s gift is everything a great gallery should be. Of course it houses Guernica, that mighty, heartbreaking cry against wickedness that is the greatest work of art of the terrible Twentieth Century, but it\u2019s so much more. Cool, spacious, unhurried (I could have spent",
          "The museum has many paintings by Dali. A good selection. Also there are paintings by Picasso. The museum is big so it takes time to see the many exhibitions. It has a nice shop and also a garden to sit in after walking around.",
          "We purchased our tickets in advance and were able to skip the lines. The collection did not compare to Prado or Thyssen and I think the organization was confusing. We did enjoy the outside cafe.",
          "Many great works by many great modern artists. Y0u could spend an entire vacation here. Buy you tickets in advance, best to come after first hour, after lines subside.",
          "Great museum. We focused on the 2nd floor, but also the 4th floor had some amazing stuff (and was extensive). Really amazing main collection, so many Dali, Picasso and Miro pieces. We did the audio tour. While I would not say the audio was great, it did provide some good",

          "What an amazing place! Thousands of pieces arranged in different style buildings and chambers. The e-ticket is a must for starting your visit with enthusiasm. I've visited this museum before 20 years. The impression I took the first time cannot be compared with the current one.",
          "Madrid's museum of modern art is wrort a visit in its self ,Pablo Picasso's Guernica makes it a must.",
          "Buy a ticket in advance and you don't have to queue. Large space, not easy to navigate. Exhibitions were typical modern art installations. All ok but didn't find it that interesting.",
          "For lovers of modern art this may be a great place. But my title for this submission likely shows my bias against modern art. This museum displays some of the horrors of war, in this case, the Spanish civil war. But why bother showing it?! It is said that those who don\u2019t know",
          "Museo Reina Sofia is 20th century art museum opened in 1992 and it is located near El Prado museum. The museum is mainly dedicated to Spanish art, with two great artists: Picasso and Dal\u00ec. You also have chance to see works by Mir\u00f3, Gris, Braque, Calder, Kandinsky, Magritte,",
          "A must if visiting Madrid! Well laid out museum with some very impressive pieces. Do get the audio guide to better understand and booking tickets in advance will save you time",
          "The pull was Guernica but the History of the piece was as powerful as the mural. An unexpected surprise was the Contemporary Art wing, art from New World colonies and art by Women. Also of interest, the new architectural retrofitting of the old building and the glass elevators",
          "If you loved Picasso this was one of his best oil painting in a big canvas . Black ,white and gray . It was the story of the war . It was only recently brought to Spain . It was in New York for the longest time .They have other selection of painting . But the highlights was the",
          "After seeing two museums in 2 days, we did not have any motivation to see another museum that too of modern art of which we are not fans. So we went to the museum in the free slot 7-9 PM and straight to the second floor where Picasso's work was there. We werent disappointed",
          "Going to this museum was one of the best ideas that we had in our stay in Madrid. We decide to go in in a group guided tour just because we wanted to know insights from the locals guides and we did ! there are a lot of paintings from different modern artists that is totally",
          "It is worth strolling a round in the museum to see the Guernica painting and the sketches prowork to the painting. We really recommend the museum. We went in the morning so the queline was not long.",
          "Guernica was definitely the highlight. Also learning the story about the painting, how it relates to the country and the paintings journey to come back to Spain. Other art was great but that was definitely the highlight. Glad I got to see it.",
          "Worth visiting.Particularly Interested to admire Guernica painting. Also other rooms are interesting.",
          "As one of the largest holders of Picasso and Miro, the museum's permanent collection is stunning. Less desirable was the constant policing of the rooms and exhibit halls by the staff to control the crowds and the photo taking. There are not clearly marked signage that indicate",
          "You can save money going here instead of to the Prado. But you should not save these money if you're like me. This museum is confusing, strange and I suppose you would benefit from speaking spanish. I know some of the history of the civil war in the thirties, and the Guernica",

          "Amazing place with a really huge important collection: Dali, Picasso, Matisse. Strongly recommend to buy tickets online: you save the queue and save money. You need two days for a reasonable visit",
          "This was the most amazing Museum we visited in Madrid, If you like modern twentieth century modern art this place has it all. It\u2019s also a highly important historical reminder for the Spanish people with Picasso\u2019s Guernica exhibited in its special room and the history around it.",
          "A must when in Madrid. Exceptional artwork and sculptures to see. The museum is very big and its a nice place to spend a rainy day",
          "Even though we did not have thios museum in our plans, I'm glad our son made the arrangements. great collection of modern art along with a good amount of Salvador Dali's and Pablo Picasso's artwork. \"La Guernica\" alone was worth the visit.",
          "If it wasn\u2019t for Guernica and that entrance to the museum is bundled with entrance to the Thyssen and the Prado I wouldn\u2019t have bothered. If you like modern art from cubism onwards and have a strong grasp of the Spanish Civil War period then it is a must. If not, it\u2019s a bust.",
          "Lots to see here in addition to the famous Guernica mural. Take time for the HC Westermann special exhibition. It\u2019s not to miss!",
          "If you are into art it is worth a visit. Was lovely to see quite a few works from Picasso and Dali. Quite a large space. A good tip is to use tbe back entrance as queues are much smaller! We waited only a few minutes compared to what would have been 45 minutes to an hour via the",

          "After waiting over an hour in the cold rain to purchase tickets, we went directly to Guernica. Stopped to see Dali and a few other important works out the way out. Very busy and confusing layout. Was it worth the wait and 10 euros? I\u2019m not sure. Wait for the free entry or a",
          "We went on Sunday afternoon when it's free entry, and the queue for the main entrance was huge. But if you walk a couple of minutes round the corner to Ronda de Atocha there's another entrance on the lower ground floor and we walked straight in with no queue at all. The museum",
          "It\u2019s a deceiving big museum with diverse art work. I really enjoyed the temporary exhibits.a few Dali and Picaso also make this a good visit. There is also a nice courtyard if you have the time to relax",
          "I'm not a major fan of contemporary art,but I still loved visiting Reina Sofia museum. Viewing Guernica in person is a major bucket list item and I wasn't disappointed. There wasn't as much Picasso or Dali paintings as I was expecting. Note that after 7pm, entry to the museum",
          "We opted for this museum as it cane very highly recommended , we were surprise how big this is and how much there is to see , don\u2019t miss it",
          "This museum is very nice with alot of Picasso, was hoping for more Dali, but all in all worth the time",
          "Because there were too Many People in the prado, we decided to Visit this Museum. It is a Must for the lover of spanish modern art. Excellent",
          "The museum is actually huge and full of contemporary art exhibitions. Choose wisely or be ready to spend hours to cover all 4 floors.",
          "Reina Sofia has one of the most iconic paintings in the world, Guernica. But lots of other interesting work. Miro and Dali with early paintings, and a very good collection of Madrid-born painter Juan Gris. Lots of other Spanish painters with less international aura but very",
          "Massive gallery well served by lifts. Good to see old films shown,expressions meant more when there was no sound! Lots of well known artists and some new ones to me,not just Spanish on show. Had to get about using a walking stick,plenty seating and I could avoid steps going",
          "Overshadowed by the Prado, the Sophia is well worth a visit to see great Spanish works of art. Picasso, Dali and Gris all represented. There are a lot of paintings by Gris..I did not know what an influence he was in Spanish painting. I gained a new appreciation for him.",
          "Go straight to the second floor and skip the rest. Dali, Miro, Picasso and Gris are worth the entrance, the remaining floors currently display angry protest art of little value other than as fire wood. Such a shame as although the space itself is uninspiring it is huge and",

          "I really thought it would impress me more, but I think Thyssen it\u00b4s more interesting than this museum. And depending on the expos you can get lost in there...But a nice place to spend the day :)",
          "For those 65 and over, the entrance fee is free for all nationalities. Make sure you bring proof of age. The new modern art wing is a joy to see. The cafe on the ground level is also an experience to not miss. You can go in the morning, go out to lunch at Terramundi not too",
          "I had one of those emotional, life-changing visits to the Sofia. Expecting a lot of Picasso, I was not ready for the gradual progression of art/movies/effects of war. Espcially considering the parallels to today's political hotbed. STRONGLY suggest this museum. Helped me",
          "Yes, the Prado is well known and exceptional, but we really enjoyed this museum. Very interesting and eclectic array of pieces.",
          "There are multiple entrances to this museum so don't wait in long lines when you can go around to the less well-known entrances. We had a staff member direct us and went from >1hr to 20 minutes to get in without advance tickets. I will do no better describing the art that has",
          "If you like modern art, this museum is definitely for you. The highlight is the large number of Picasso paintings, and to be specific, Guernica. This huge monochrome painting only arrived back in Spain in 1981 after the cruel dictatorship of Franco ended. Worth a visit just",
          "This museum what I think of when it comes yo true art. Not just painting but everything to engage the mind while also entertaining the eye. Fantastic exhibit",
          "Having just visited the Lourve & Le Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Vatican Museum in Rome, the Accademia in Florence and the Prado in Madrid on the same trip, the Reina Sofia was by far the standout for me. Found myself staring at paintings, sketches and sculptures and was",
          "I visited this museum and spent many hours wondering around galleries looking at the different pieces. some of the art can challenge and i understand that some would not like the art as it can seem dark, but if you are a fan Picasso, Dali and Arroyo it is well worth the visit,",
          "We're not art aficionados but we really enjoyed walking around this impressive gallery with it's famous works by Picasso, Dali and others. We spent around an hour and a half browsing the galleries and felt it was a really great thing to do. We went during the free hours on",
          "This museum is choppy with lots of little rooms but once you navigate it you can see many different types of art.",
          "Good collection of Salvador Dali, Miro and of course Picasso housed in a beautiful building that has been sympathetically restored.",
          "This is a great museum of modern art. The collection impressed me very much - in contrast to the Prado. This is certainly also a must, but I will visit Reina Sofia again. I would like to thank everyone who runs this museum and works there. Very friendly people! Thank you very",
          "Picasso\u2019s Guernica is in this museum. There is free admission on Sundays. The collection of cubist work is outstanding . You can take pictures of pretty much everything in the museum except the galleries right around Guernica and Guernica itself. Standing in front of this",
          "Not being an aficionado of modern art, I didn't even want to go--but I am glad I did. The museum did a good job of educating me on what the painting was about and why it was an important painting. The audio guide and laminated pages in the room were helpful. We looked around",
          "Amazing works and stories of Spanish modernists including Dali, Picasso & Miro. Highly recommended and allow at least 2 hours.",
          "The mood of the Reina Sofia differs a lot from Prado and Thyssen. It is grey with a lot of despair. Much is centered on the resolution of Spain's traumas from the civil war and Franco rule. Moreover, we found the thematic arrangement of the paintings and sculpture difficult to",

          "The museum itself is in nice building with good rooms for viewing, etc. But the collection leaves much to be desired. The Picasso Guernicia (sp) was the only piece that was worth looking at - non-flash photos allowed everywhere except for this piece. I was happy that I",

          "I went there mostly for the paintings of Picasso and Dal\u00ed, since I'm not much of an art enthusiast. The Guernica is amazing, it's really something to spend awhile admiring. Other than that don't expect to see much more of Picasso or Dal\u00ed. You're not allowed to take pictures of",

          "Lovely gallery with many many masterpieces which you will no doubt recognise even if you don't know who the artists are. My suggestion would be to combine this with the one of the other art gallaries in this part of town",

          "since my last visit, anyway. This is a serious art museum and as good as most in the world in its field. It has a very strong collection of modern and contemporary art displayed in conjunction with a number of temporary exhibitions and merits a minimum of two hours, three or",

          "The prize here is Picasso\u2019s Guernica, the painting of the horror of war. Very fragile, it\u2019s amazing Picasso got it out of France before the Nazi occupation. I would concentrate on this as you can\u2019t see everything. Go to the basement restaurant after viewing, not at all",
          "The most famous of which is Guernica, but there's lots of other Picasso's, Dali's etc. We chose this gallery as a smaller alternative to the Prada but it's still a big place to get around in an afternoon",
          "We went on Sunday at 1:30 when admission was free. The museum is enormous - more than can be taken in in one visit - and the number of artworks is very impressive. Most notable is Picasso's huge painting, Guernica, and the many works of Miro and Dali. The sculpture garden",

          "This place is a must-see for whoever likes modern art. The design is by definition modern and makes you think of the Whitney Museum in New York. A lot of things to see (expect at least 4 hours to see everything). Very spacious rooms and not crowded at the end of the day. The",

          "On a recent Sunday in Madrid I was able to visit this museum and enjoy some of the works of Dali and Picasso. We had thought they were in the Prado museum (moved years ago apparently). As a bonus the museum was free (every Sunday of the month?) but there was quite queue to get",
          "We had had a long lunch and had planned to spend just a little time in the Museum - 1-2 hours. We decided just to do one floor and to see the most well known pieces. We obviously enjoyed seeing Picasso's Guernica, pieces by Miro and others by Dali. It was good wandering",
          "We went at around 12 midday and the queue was minimal, the back entrance is probably favorite. A fantastic collection of art, we stayed 3 hours , probably only saw half of it. A must see in Madrid, but go with fresh legs, lots to see and some distance to cover.",
          "In Reina Sofia museum you can see the famous paint by Pablo Picasso \"Guernica\". There are also other paintings of Dal\u00ed, Mir\u00f2 and Pollock. The museum is quite big and you should sacrifice at least 3 hours to see it. Free entrance every day from 19:00-21:00. The queue is huge, so",
          "This wonderful museum holds Picasso's Guernica that is truly a \"must see in person\" piece of art. You have to see it live in order to appreciate its grandeur and its important message, In addition to this, there are a number of other very important pieces by Picasso and Dali.",
          "This was our final museum of the big three we chose (Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza). it's not considered as great as Prado, but they are all worth visiting and appreciating. Reina Sofia was just our personal favorite, not just because of Picasso's Guernica (sorry, but can't",

          "We liked this museum a lot more than the Prado because it has more modern art. The first floor was definitely our favourite. The other floors were worth-while as well, but it's kind of easy to get lost... It's free in the evening by the way, like many museums in Madrid.",
          "You either go to visit the Prado Museum or this one. Reina Sofia is smaller so you can look at the paintings longer. My favorite part is the top floor. I recommend visiting this museum.",

          "A superb collection, well displayed. Whether one is an art lover or not no visit to Madrid would be complete without seeing Picasso's Guernica, his astounding and immediate response to the air bombing of the town in 1937. Having seen it only in reproduction the first impression",

          "Wish we had a chance to go back for a second visit. Went for free Sunday evening. Quick access. Line-up wasn't bad - not a long wait to get in. Picasso's Guernica is very worthwhile. It's such an important work of art. Interpretation of the painting is very well done. The",

          "It was my second visit to Reina Sofia - first time I came in summer about 6 years ago. The museum is great! I\u2019d recommend good half day for it. Besides permanent exhibitions it always worth to visit temporary ones, so take your time and enjoy! The free entry after 6pm on",
          "It is worthwhile planning your visit in advance as the building is very large and can be tricky to navigate, particularly if searching for a specific artist as it is organised by artistic movements. This means eg Picassos and Dalis can be found in various locations.It would be",
          "This was like being dropped in the middle of a desert without any signposts. None of the guides spoke English and the maps inside the gallery were very poor. Exhibits by Dali/ Picasso the stars of the show. Try Prado next time.",

          "Have to say I enjoyed this museum but the art is not to my taste. As you enter the first galleries it is noticeable that the art work is very political . There are numerous floors within the museum with a glass lift going up the outside .if like me you don t have a head for",
          "The main reason anyone would visit is of course the Guernica, but also there are a few Dali pieces to enjoy. Very good to visit in the free hours, two hours prior to closure, as it was rather uncrowded and two hours are enough for the exploration. A major drawback for me was",
          "I am NOT a museum lover, and so I basically felt like I wasted 10euro and 90 minutes of my day in Madrid Its HUGE, and if you really like museums, you could easily spend an entire day here. 10 euro is probably a good value as well, but hey, im just not into museums,",
          "My husband and I are definitely not modern art lovers so we made a beeline to see Guernica. We saw Guernica in 1985 when it was housed in its own museum, and now it remains equally impressive in the current setting. Guernica is a \"do not miss\" painting, as even for people who",

          "Considering it houses one of the most well-known paintings in the world, Reina Sofia is a must visit. Entry is free at certain periods and that's when I'd recommend going. The layout isn't that well organised and it can be a bit confusing to get around in",
          "We visited the Reina Sophia gallery and spent 4 hours there incl a lovely hour having a light lunch in their terrace restaurant sitting in the February sun. The gallery is amazing if you love modern art. Great collection of Cubist art incl many Picasso's and Gris. It's a huge",
          "This was the second time for me visiting the Reina Sophia, the place is massive. I love the diversity of the work, the Caulder sculpture in the courtyard. However as a more senior person there are not enough benches to rest, one must walk far to find a place to drink some",
          "This is the museum to see cubist artist like Picasso. It is also the home of famous Guernica. Reserve time. If you go there on a free entry day, pick what are you going to see because you don\u2019t have time for everything. Also be 30min before there to wait in line.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Sant Antoni de Portmany (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8sant \u0259n\u02c8t\u0254ni \u00f0\u0259 pur\u02c8ma\u0272], Spanish: San Antonio Abad) or San Antonio is a town on the western coast of Ibiza. It is the second-largest town and municipality in Ibiza; an island described by Time Out magazine as \"arguably the clubbing capital of the universe\". The town is situated on Sant Antoni Bay on the west coast of the island, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor two thousand years, Sant Antoni was a small fishing village that rose from the Roman natural harbor Portus Magnus, but it began to grow in the late 1950s when many hotels and tourist resorts were built as part of a mass tourism initiative which took place across Spain. As the number of tourists grew, the development of bars, hotels and other tourist infrastructure spread right around to the other side of San Antonio bay, as far as Cala de Bou which lies in the adjacent municipality of Sant Josep de sa Talaia. Since the 1980s British tourists have made up the majority of summertime visitors to San Antonio.\n\n\n=== The Egg ===\n\nThe Egg is the best known landmark in Sant Antoni, located in the centre of the main roundabout at the entrance to the town.The Egg is a statue erected in the early 1990s to commemorate the local claim of having been the birthplace of Christopher Columbus (there is a similar claim that Hannibal was born in the region). The statue is in the shape of an egg, containing at its centre a model of his ship: the Santa Maria.The choice of an egg comes from a story about Columbus, who when seeking funding for his Western route to the Indies, was told it was impossible. He then allegedly asked if standing an egg upright was impossible, and when told that it was, he cracked the base of an egg, thus making it possible for it to stand upright. He was then granted funding. See Egg of Columbus.\n\n\n=== Passeig de ses Fonts ===\n\nPart of Sant Antoni's harbourside promenade, Passeig de ses Fonts, is an area which was developed in the early 1990s to improve the appearance of the town. There are many plants, including palm trees and rubber plants, as well as large fountains, which are illuminated by night. Across the square are a host of restaurants and caf\u00e9s offering a view over Sant Antoni Bay.  It is also the best place from which to watch the massive fireworks display which celebrates the fiesta of Saint Bartholomew on 24 August.\n\n\n=== West End ===\nThe 'West End' is an area of San Antonio. Only a couple of streets wide; the main street is the Carrer de Santa Agn\u00e8s, it hosts a variety of bars ranging from the dance and house music Ibiza is famed for to rock and indie music. PR staff line the street trying to attract tourists into any of the many bars on the strip with special deals on alcohol. It is also the location of the Island's only strip & lap dancing club: Taboo. Bars on the street open as early as 10am for breakfasts and continue to steadily open throughout the day for sports or afternoon entertainment until everything is open by 11pm and then everything closes again at 3am.\nOriginally the name \"The West End\" refers to a night time minibus trip from hotels in Es Cana in the 1970s that would come to San Antonio's bars (as Es Cana had no bar scene) and the name of this tour package was \"The West End Experience\". Since then the area has become known simply as \"The West End\".\n\n\n=== Sunset Strip ===\nAlong the coast of the natural bay of San Antonio de Portmany in the west is the Sunset Strip - a venue where visitors to the island meet at sunset at various bars including the Cafe del Mar, Caf\u00e9 Mambo, where the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Carl Cox, David Guetta and Pete Tong DJ on a regular basis. The west-facing strip of coastline means that it faces the sunset. Mint Lounge Bar, Caf\u00e9 Savannah, Fresh Ibiza and Caf\u00e9 del Mar are situated here. Caf\u00e9 Del Mar is one of the iconic Ibiza venues that has played an integral part in the evolution of the island over the last four decades.\n\n\n=== Ferries and boat cruises ===\nAmong the harbour of San Antonio there are various boats and ferries that have multiple connections to beaches such as Cala Bassa, Cala Compte, Pinet Playa, Es Puet, Cala Grasi\u00f3, Cala Salada and Port es Torrent. These have daily departures from may until end September or October. Also once a week there is a ferry to Formentera.\n\n\n=== Nightclubs ===\nSant Antoni is home to two of the main Ibiza nightclubs, Es Paradis, established in 1975, and Eden which was renamed from Kaos in 1999 and renovated in 2013.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Municipality of Sant Antoni de Portmany\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Town Hall website (in Catalan)\nLocal government website\nGoogle maps of Sant Antoni\nSan Antonio Ibiza Travel Guide",

          "40 min walk in and out of forest along a cliff top trail with some great views well worth doing. Better in the morning before it gets hot. Well marked trail with painted yellow and white strips on the rocks and plenty of white plastic cups. Terrain is rocky and lots of tree",
          "We had a lovely windy, refreshing walk around the area. The views were nice, took some lovely photos and it was a super location. Well recommended.",
          "You could view the lighthouse by walking through Portanax, it took about 10 minutes was a pleasant walk.",
          "Not the easiest path to follow but a nice walk if you fancy a bit of off road. Best early morning to beat the heat and take water with you as nothing on way. It took us just over an hour to go there and back, starting from Barcelo Hotel. Would recommend good footwear, not the",
          "We stayed in Portinatx and walked to the lighthouse. Some nice views on the way but the actual light house was not well kept and looked bedraggled.",
          "Somehow we lost our way quite near the start of the walk and spent ages trying to get back onto the path. However, we enjoyed the walk! The light house isn't anything special but the scenery is lovely. If you carry on to Calla d'en Serra, there are some difficult sections, so",
          "Not very well marked, we hiked through some foresty type area which had been marked with previous peoples stones and ribbons on trees- like a horror show in the making so you have to pay attention. We drove to an area away from Portinatx to access this area. I walked it in flip",
          "Park at Portinatx Beach and keep to the path along the coast. There are painted directions on rocks to help guide you. There are also other paths that head inland, but these aren't as obvious. The lighthouse is nice, but it's the scenery that is the attraction.",

          "At this part of Ibiza, you'll see the forces of nature when water and rocks met eachother. It was quit windy when we visited this beautifull place, so the water came on a high level against the rocks.",
          "We did this walk on our last day as it was a bit windy and we could not go out in a boat. This proved to be a popular walk along the coast as there was an endless stream of people taking this walk to the lighthouse. The walk was along the edge of the cliff, which offered some",
          "I had an hour to kill and was staying at Barcelo Portinatx which is just next to the start of the path. It was very hot but this meant I was the only person on the path. The walk is a little challenging, I definitely would not recommend it to people who may struggle to walk at",

          "You can spot large spiders (including wasp spiders) if you go off the track a little. This is a fun walk if you get bored of lying on the beach. Easy walk from the town of Portinatx and if you feel like it try walking on a little further round the coast until you reach the",
          "We had read it was worth going to from Portinatx. The first bit along the road was fine, and then we arrived at a car park and it was not clear which way to go. We went the right way but missed the path to the left. You must keep the sea in sight most of the time or you are",

          "Well worth the little effort jut to the light house, and the coast beyond. There is supposedly a circular walk, but we had a little problem finding it. However when leaving the near car park, keep to the coastal track, to the left. Dont plough straight on or bear to the right. A",

          "A very easy, yet truly rewarding walk up to the lighthouse. Start by the car park and follow the path, you will get there in no time! Next time, we will visit with a picnic as the views are absolutely stunning from up there.",

          "We made the effort and was so worth it. Breathtaking. Parking can be a problem as the small bay comes to life. Take care for the first part of the walk if coming from car park as parts of the rock path are breaking away due to erosion. Don't worry, alternative paths being",
          "Bit tricky at times and there's been some cliff falls which make the path quite close to the cliff edge at times. Definitely not buggy-able and not recommended for those who don't like heights or a rocky terrain. Take water as there's nothing at the light house. Beautiful views",
          "The hike out is very well marked with Blue arrows painted on the rocks so it's easy to find your way. The trail gets uncomfortably close to the cliffside at some points but the views were incredible! I imagine if the weather wasn't so windy it would have been a lot less",
          "quite a good walk from the town very hilly and rocky you need a head for heights in places and strong shoes, I was struggling at one point and a man came past on a mountain bike",
          "A nice walk along the cliff tops. not a long walk maybe around 30 mins if you take your time but worth the trip as the views are really great",
          "I did this walk in August. I'm a fairly slow walker and it was hot, but it only took me 35mins each way. It took me a while to figure out the actual route (I did it from Portinatx). Go to the car park at the end of Portinatx, the one by 'Portinatx' beach and the Paradise Beach",

          "Old tired bird poo in the blue slide and feathers. The lake where kids swimming significant amounts of bird poo in bottom stuck to bottom and feathers. Showers outside not working water smelt old and tired",
          "What a great place! Airplanes flaying above your head to Ibiza Airport! Tasty food! Few slides which actually was fun! Place for small kids is available as well! The only one small issue was that there where not enough water in the water slides so kids has to push",
          "After reading previous reviews decided to just do an afternoon here. How pleasantly surprised i was. Yes I agree it\u2019s not on the same category as Siam park in Tenerife or Dubai water parks BUT it is much better than described. Theirs a Kamikaze (but not too big/scared) Foam",
          "Arrived here off our tourist coach and walked in there are lots of slides like kamikaze, foam, black hole and others, it\u2019s good but food and drink are a tad expensive!",
          "A bit expensive, especially when the kids are over 12 but they enjoyed it. Sun, ice and a big pool with several slides",
          "We went here with our 5 year old who can just about swim but isn\u2019t yet overly confident therefore most of the rides were not suitable. It\u2019s a case of using the baby slides which are rubbish as halfway down you get stuck and have to push yourself down or just use the main pool",
          "If this wasn\u2019t included in our stay, we wouldn\u2019t have paid for it! 6 slides and salt water pools. Ok as an alternative to the hotel pool!",
          "Ok, first of all if you have been to some global super Aquapark, best to lower your expectations HOWEVER, this place is well operated, staff are friendly as long as you abide by the rules. Slides are of the old school variety but with a decent choice for all ages and despite age",
          "Good day trip, lots of slides spaced out across the park. Mostly aimed at kids only 2 rides that stand out as thrill seeking but all rides fun nevertheless. Spent 4 hours here with my friend, plenty of places to sit and dry in the sun. Only issues was there was no deep area in",
          "Not the biggest or the best but we had a fun time and stayed about 5 hours. Considering it's in Playa den Bossa, it is a quiet, small water park and not full of louts. We got to go on the slides repeatedly, with no queuing. Good active lifeguards. Clean. Stunned are free.",
          "Visited the water park with 2 kids aged 3 & 9 and they loved it, nice little water park not overly busy and didn't have to que for ages to get on the slides, little area for the younger one and he had a great day, 9 year old was able to get on all the slides twice. Great day",
          "Went here with two kids aged 11 and 10 and both had a fantastic time. We got a bus there and taxi back to our resort but if you have a hire car their is plenty of parking spaces. There are 8 slides, two of which you can go down on large inflatable rings. There is a large shallow",
          "Well kept little water park. Had a really fun day here with a 10 year old. Not huge amounts of slides, but plenty to keep us occupied. The staff were really helpful and friendly. No idea about the cafe, as we took a packed lunch due to a recommendation to do so from our holiday",
          "Day out with 2 boys so you need to be energetic- loads of fun - clean, no queues, great relaxation areas and v safe with lots of life guards calling the shots. Dated somewhat compared to others I've been to but certainly far more fun and relaxation for a day out. Bring a picnic",
          "The positive parts are - clean, plenty of sun beds, pool area nice, chutes were all working. The not so good parts - not enough chutes for a full day compared to some water parks but my girls enjoyed it - we were 4 hours and that was enough. The cafe area very poor quality of",
          "Here at the moment with our 10 year old who gives it 5 stars. First time here. They cater for-young/older kids and the adults are also having lots of fun. 5 main slides to use which are all great. Not too busy. Food typical fast food which is ok.",
          "Had a great time good price great fun worth a visit good to wake u up after party lol was very clean good slides etc many. Thanks Will be back",
          "Went to Aguamar waterpark today as we had a very late flight out of Ibiza and needed something to do to pass the time. At first we thought it was a bit pricey, but it was totally worth it. The slides are clearly a bit old, but every effort has been made to keep the structures",
          "Right near our hotel grand palladium great fun for all the family not massive but good day out \u20ac20 adult \u20ac13 child . No que in the morning seemed after 12 pm more people arrived . Lots of sun beds and brolleys which are needed as we went on a hot day . Drinks ,food and ice",
          "Booked this through the rep for 18 euros each which is 4 euros cheaper than buying at the venue. When we entered we were expecting a decent water park as this is supposed to be Ibiza\u2019s biggest water park. Well if this is the biggest I wouldn\u2019t like to see the others. Kamikaze",
          "We love visiting Aguamar water park. It\u2019s not a massive water park but it\u2019s really great for kids. We have a 6 years old that loves it there and asked to go again after our first visit 2. There were plenty of sun beds available and there is a picnic area if you want to take your",
          "Small but fun waterpark. No long queues, enough sun loungers. 18 euros for adults and 10 euros for kids. Think you can get a family ticket a bit cheaper. A good way to spend half a day. We went twice.",
          "This is a smaller aquapark than others i have visited abroad, but compensated for fully by the admission fee and free parking. We ate here and good choice and value all cooked fresh. Service at the food counter was very organized and efficient. Highly recommend the fresh",
          "We visited last week and despite having a great water park at our own hotel would say Aguamar is definitely worth a visit. Entry was \u20ac56 for 2 adults and 2 children and there was ample parking right next to the park. We hired a locker for valuables which was \u20ac5 charge plus \u20ac5",
          "Had a great day here with our 2 children. Hardly any queuing and lots of fun. Food on offer was good too, especially the roast chicken!",
          "We went here for the day as a family, grandparents, parents and kids age 8,11 &13. The waterpark isn't the biggest in the world, but for a day out with kids of various ages it was perfect. Queues aren't as long as other water parks and move quickly. The park isn't modern but",
          "We arrived at the water park while it was raining we had precooked tickets for that day only as we were going home the next day , we entered the park and as we got in every one was out of the pool standing around after about an hour we asked the staff at the food outlet what",
          "Arrived just after park opened, it definitely is open despite what Trip Advisor says!! Plenty of loungers and no queues for the slides. We got on everything before it got too busier and small queues developed. We never queued for more than 10 minutes. Lifeguards were all",
          "For starters the park is OPEN even though Trip Advisor says it is shut. Stayed all day and had lunch as well. The food was very nice, 2 if us had Hot Dog and Chips, 1 of us had a burger and another one of us had just a batch of chips. All was cooked perfectly. We did have to",
          "Aguamar is OPEN. Currently enjoying a day at Aguamar Water Park, three generations (teen,40s & 60s) have visited in the past and still enjoy coming here every year. Plentiful supply of free sun beds and parasols, opens at 10am, the earlier you get here the more choice for where",
          "Slides are average, food is terrible, not enough sunbeds pool looks dirty & so does everything else in the water park! Such a shame as it has the potential to be amazing! I would advice eating before you go or taking food with you! Arrive early if you want a sun bed.",
          "Perfect for families. Food v good too. Very clean. Slightly jaded looking but so what, it\u2019s a frigging water park!!",
          "Good day out with older children while on holiday. It's a bit outdated but still good fun. Went on an organised trip with TUI. Children enjoyed it and had a good day. Sunbeds were hard to come by. Food area got busy so we didn't buy food. You can rent lockers for valuables.",
          "I had to take a look to ensure it was open and I can confirm that tripadvisor is incorrect stating it\u2019s closed. I took my wife and 1 kids and it was \u00a350 entry. That\u2019s actually not bad for a water park. The slides are ok, nothing spectacular but enjoyable. The kids loved it.",
          "Visited with three adults a teenager and a five year old. Everyone was entertained lots of age appropriate water experiences including the thrill seekers in the family. It was a little expensive I feel however when you are on holiday you don't mind spending out on memories. Tip:",
          "The park is small with fewer rides than expected, for the price. Its not well signposted if coming by bus, as it is not on the main road but we saw plenty of parking, Inside lots of sunbeds plus a separate picnic area, changing rooms, showers, lockers (separate price) etc.",
          "We visited this park with our 8 year old son and had a brilliant day. Allot of reviews say the park is small and you can do all the slides in a space of 30 minutes, so what. Yes it's not the biggest of water parks but it was perfect for us and we stayed 7 hours. Sun loungers,",
          "We made a day of it and came here at 10am for a full day. Very quiet early on but it does get busier later in the day. Plenty of sunbeds to go around. We were a group of 9 and everyone had fun. The on-site cafe is great, huge selection of food and very reasonably priced-which",
          "My friends and I love a good water park so thought we would give it a go. We paid through the TUI rep and it was really cheap so weren\u2019t sure what to expect. When we got there it was very quiet and stayed that way for most of our trip there. It was great, there were plenty of",
          "My partner and I visited this park today. It\u2019s a good place to do something abit different on your holiday. We loved all the slides and there is plenty of sunbeds to relax when you\u2019re done. Restaurant food was nice. Loved it being right under a flight path, didn\u2019t realise until",
          "I suppose Ibiza is a party island so not much more there than clubs but we thought we would give this a go. We completed all slides within 30 mins. Not very big and not much choice but it wasted a bit of time and gave us something to do.",
          "Took our two children here quite a while back and they had a great day. Not too big a park so felt safe and easy to find the children! They loved it.",
          "first visited here when i was 14 yrs old, i remember them charging to use the sun loungers and food being very expensive. today i visited after 23 years \ud83d\ude2e with my children of 7years and almost nothing has changed! only you dont pay for sun loungers now and the food is",
          "We always want to go to a water park, with a teenager and 5 year old this always provides a good option to keep both parties happy. The waterpark is easily accessibly by taxi (we stayed in Port D\u2019Torrent at Seaview) and taxi was around 20Euros. The best slides have height",
          "we all loved the waterpark, was so much fun. Buses stop directly outside and is only a very short walk to the shops. Fair prices for food and drink and food was not to bad. staff were pleasant however one of the lifeguards always appeared asleep when you got to the top of the",
          "Took my 18yr old for a day out and wasted the day, slides are timid, staff unhelpful a very poor place, no lazy river to relax in or jacuzzi pool, and the cost of entry is far to high for the service we received. A very poor place un less you have small kids.",
          "Got some slides. Some places to relax. A bridge to walk across. Toilets. Slides. Wait, did I already mention the slides?",
          "Very enjoyable day out. Excellent slides for the price. Cheapest beer on the island. Would come again.",
          "This water park is a must go to as it is the only water park on the island. This water park is amazing with a 200m high slide. There is also a nice restraunt on-site. Amazing park for amazing memories!",
          "Decent waterpark, never that busy. Wasn't too much there to go on, but saying that, the slides that were there were fun enough. I spent 8 hours there and didn't get bored at all. Lots of space for sun beds, nice food, and fun slides. It's a great destination to go to for the day",
          "Good value It has 6 good slides and splash pools for the young ones Plenty of sun beds and a few sun shades Yes it is a bit old but all works well Very few queues Food was OK and good value. We waited approx 10 mins for food so not too bad We had a great day Only negative was",
          "Had a full day here\ud83d\udc4dnot over priced food and drinks basic but good. again not a bank breaker. Would recommend for full day of fun.\ud83d\ude00\ud83c\udf1e",
          "Visited here on a Saturday in August. We drove to Playa D'en Bossa from our hotel near Santa Eularia which took us approximately 45 minutes. It is just next to the old Space nightclub (now called Hi Ibiza) and parking is free at this water park. We had to pay 9\u20ac for our 4 year",
          "It would be a fairly good value day out considering it's for the whole day except for one thing. I had to spend the whole day on my own watching our bags instead of enjoying time with my family. No lockers left. We didn't get there until lunchtime. Still paid full price so they",
          "We spend a whole day at the Aquamar. The kids absolutely loved all the rides. There are also enough pools if you don't want to go on the rides. The grounds are also beautiful, lots of space for picnics and lounging about. Highly recommend.",
          "With a total of 12 in our group, (youngest child aged 8, teenagers and adults)it is sometimes difficult to please everyone but this water park exceeded all our expectations and delighted everyone. Plenty of sun beds and shade if needed. If was small enough that the kids found",
          "The visit to this aqua park is a little double sided. On the one side it is the only waterpark in Ibiza so not much to compare with on the island. Furthermore it is close to the airport so we have several departing planes over our heads per hour. The restaurant is just average",
          "Not the best water park but the kids enjoyed the day out. The food wasn't badly priced and the roast chicken and chips was surprisingly good for \u00a37. Was quiet in the morning but packed by 3pm which is when we left.",
          "Having read some of the previous reviews think some people are very over dramatic. First of all the water park is clean, people writing reviews moaning about flys and wasps (news flash - you are outside and covered in sun cream!) Yes it is a bit dated but it's fun and a good day",
          "We went here a few days ago and we were very disappointed. Firstly, it is very dirty and old. The pool had green stuff floating in it and wasps fly everywhere! There was plenty of sun beds which were needed as we did most of the slides in the first hour. There isn't much to do",
          "This isn't for the extreme thrillseekers who are complaining it's boring. It's a fun little water park for families although some of the bigger slides do have height restrictions to use. The main pool is deep enough for children to enjoy whilst safely still touching the bottom.",
          "went to the park organised through the first choice reps, good fast entry, normal ,thing , most sun beds taken but managed to find some eventually behind some trees ! lockers available , ten euros , five returned, ques were short , not much waiting, all staff on each slide were",
          "I was here yesterday 31/07/17 and I have to say some of the reviews on here are very unfair. \u20ac18 entry for adults (that includes a sun lounger for you to use all day) is well worth it and there are 4/5 decent rides I've been to typhoon lagoon in Orlando and Aqualand in",
          "Very small park slides ok but pool dirty , doesnt look clean anywhere ! Toilets rank ! Not enough beds or shade umberella's must be 5 in total ! But kids enjoying thats why its got 2 stars , nothing else .full of wasps with arms & legs , huge queues for food & drink .",
          "Went here for a day whilst on holiday with my boyfriend (both 20). We decided to do the TUI deal with park tickets and transport included (\u20ac40 each). Transport -Got picked up from our hotel in a bus with no air-con in the 32 degree heat, the coach ride was completely",
          "Took my son there and what you see from the road is what is in the park it,s very small and could do with updating but it,s ok for a few hours away from the hotel and you don,t have to wait long for your turn.",
          "We have been coming to Ibiza annually for 13 years and this was our first visit to the aqua park. I really wished we hadn\u2019t left it so long as we had a fantastic time! The kids aged from 16 to 10 all had a great time and are now totally exhausted. Our 10 year old was able to use",
          "Went twice on our holiday as my boys loved it. Lots of fun, not too packed and food was very tasty. The park itself is dated but it give us a break from the monotony of sitting around the pool for hours. The restaurant could do with more competent staff as they were very",
          "Went to Aguamar with a 5- and 10-year old. Yes, the water park is not brand new, so there are rust spots on the stairs; and the water is salty (like the tap water in Ibiza), but who cares? If the only water park you have been to is Wild Wadi in Dubai (or any other new and fancy",
          "Went here while we was on holiday in Ibiza. First off the waterpark is very small, there is only a couple of slides and some are very dangerous. We got hurt in one of the closed slides when the life guard nudged the raft and we almost fell out. The food here is okay, due to it",
          "Not so bad as I have read on some reviews here. Indeed its an old place and it shows. For three slides you have to be 1.40 meters. Our girls, 6 and 9 years old, are not, but they've had a fun day. A lot of whistleblowing from the strict staff. Lockers 5 euro plus 5 deposit. Weve",
          "Went here on advise and was thoroughly disappointed. It is a very dated and old water park in need of much refurbishment and update of facilities. There is nothing for young children to do and the slides for adults aren't great. The water was dirty and salty as well as only",
          "Been coming here for over 25 years and it hasn't changed apart from a few extra slides. Dont let that put you off as it does what it says it does with no fuss. Kids will love it & parents can get their head down for a few hours while the kids enjoy themselves. Cheap to get in,",
          "Took a group of 8 kids here for birthday party. Was surprised at how clean and safe it was. Loads of stuff to do for kids from 2 upwards with a shallow area for toddlers and a climbing frame. Some massive slides that are really good and clean and well manned. We went really",
          "Went on the day is opened, 2nd June. Great rides and clean pool. Lots of fun and lots of room to sunbathe.",
          "Tried to go here today, but told was closed. So recommend checking before go. Went to boss bech instead.",
          "This is quite small for a waterpark. However there are some great slides and an area for children. However, when we went the place seemed a little tired and grubby, and the toilets were shocking!",
          "Where do I start!!! This water park is soooo old!!! It looks like it was once a good water park!!! It's it not very big which is nice as kids can go and play!! But the is water marks up the walls!! The stairs to the slides are wobbled and make a Terrible noice!! We did not eat",
          "Basic and fun water park for kids. Long twisty slides to be expected. No frills. Clean. Bring your own towels.",
          "I was excited to check this place out after going there as a young child but when I went it was a huge disappointment. One good thing was the day that I went it was very quiet but that maybe due to coming off-season. Two slides were closed and one ride kept opening and",
          "a great place to chill out and enjoy the water sports and rides, there is facility of lockers and you can book your tickets in advance",
          "We had a good day, plenty of sun beds and lockers, plenty of slides the black hole is a must pool is clean",
          "This is located at the end of the beach set back from the road, there is a great choice of rides for all ages, the water park is quite dated though and all of the facilities need updating.",
          "Loved the different varieties of water rides! They were all fun and close in proximity to each other. but I suggest you arrive early to avoid the sun and water lovers The food was pricey",
          "Great atmosphere and lots to do. varieties of rides and attentive life guards. I cant swim so I was well taken care of as I told them I cant swim. Great for family, couples or even solo as you will meet lovely people there all trying to get on the ride. the bathrooms and",
          "Went last week. Been a few times over the years but felt it was dated, uninteresting and to be honest needs demolishing. Staff were imitating a rear ending when they saw some young girls enter the waterpark. At least the girls caught them and headed off to a different part of",
          "Very much enjoyed this water park it has a great amount of slides which were very fun and a large area to relax in with plentiful loungers. Great food and drink choice and only \u20ac5.49 for 1/2 litre of sangria. Would definately recommend",
          "The water park was a good day out but the whole park had a feel as though it had been that way for years. A touch of paint here and there would make the world of difference. The rides were good but it was easy to go on all of them within half an hour. From the top of the",
          "First of all we purchased out tickets with Thomson - HUGE mistake \u20ac95 for 2 adults and 1 child (thank goodness our infant was free!) When we got to the park we realised how much we had been ripped off by the travel company. We stayed in Cala Llonga so I highly recommend you take",
          "We booked tickets before we left for out holiday, it wasn't any cheaper than turning up on the day. We stayed for 6 hours and the children had a great time, us adults went on a couple of slides too. The food was reasonable priced, you can take a picnic in if you wish and there",
          "ame here for the day for my daughters 14 th Birthday. great fun kept my 9 year old and 14 year old amused all day. Lots of vairety of slides for a small park , lovely little restuaraunt for lunch and reasonably priced too",
          "been here a couple of times and really enjoyed it. Plenty of loungers for everyone and lockers to keep valuables out of the way . The rides are good but maybe could do with a little bit of \"updating\" as kids and adults want to have the thrill factor. Food and drinks available",
          "We went to Aquamar in September hoping for a long fun day out on the slides. It was very apparent from out side that the water park was small and looked very kiddish. I think we counted 8 slides altogether but nothing that really got us excited. I tried to take my GO PRO",
          "Good day... not the biggest water park I've ever been to but didn't have to long to wait to get on rides.",
          "Pretty tired in general. Salt water pools and slides, which coupled with sunshine make opening your eyes (going down the slides) impossible. Overall not a cheap option and could do with an overhaul (and fresh water - showers at least)",
          "We visited here in August with our 4 year old. The area for young children at first glance looks great but the water slides really are rubbish. The children can't slide down them at all and end up having to be pulled along or worse still walk down them! Our 4 year old soon",
          "This waterpark is quite small and a little bit dated. I liked the fact that it is small. Lots of sunbeds, lockers for valuables. My children aged 12 and 9 loved it. No big queues and great staff. \u20ac18 for adults and \u20ac10 for children. Restaurant food is cheap and cheerful. We",
          "Dropped three teenage boys off for the afternoon and they called to get picked up in less than an hour saying it was 'pants' and no way worth the 18 Euros entry fee. There was human faeces on the concrete and this provided more excitement than the rides. Nothing like the video",
          "Great fun although quite basic but for a morning it's really worth the money. My advice get there as it opens at 10am and you'll get an hour without any queues. Snacks and drinks available as are lockers Great fun for a family",
          "Came here with two adults, one 12 year old and one 11 year old. The child rate for entry is 10\u20ac and when entering I was questioned the children's age. They asked for some ID I.e a passport which I explained I wouldn't bring to a water park with me. In the end I had to pay for",
          "This water park is very dated!! But with the slides, good weather and children a good time can still be had. It's slightly overpriced for what's there. I visited when I was 12 and I am now almost 31 and it still looks exactly the same. My husband and I were slightly shocked (in",
          "Visited here August 7th 2016. Our two 11yr old boys loved it. Went with Thomson. Went on the rides multiple times, queues grew as the park got busy,but it wasn't that bad. We didn't notice the water being that salty. Make sure you get a parasole, it is a bit exposed. Took a",
          "Needs a lazy river . Kids rides stupidly slow . 5e for a locker after paying to get in is a rip off . Queue management needs to be better .",
          "My children had a lovely day here and even met jenny Frost from atomic kitten they didn't want to leave x",
          "We paid roughly \u00a320 per person 4adults and two young children 8years and 5years old. So I was expecting cleanliness enough sun loungers and shades and to feel safe!!!!! This park is old and extremely run down.... One ride on the (high) steps walking up to it.... There was a",
          "Decent value. The slides are slow, but our children are youngish. The youngest at 6 loved it. But after three hours, the game was up and they were ready to go.",
          "Not the best water park in the world but good for a day out, wasn't busy the day we went and could pretty much just walk onto any slide without waiting! Nice size pool and only about a dozen slides, some of the lifeguards can be funny if you take a GoPro! Still had a enjoyable",
          "We visited here twice. Out hotel was located just a short 5 minute walk away from the waterpark. The park is small yes, but because it doesn't get too busy it's quite fun. Suitable for all ages. Food served in the restaurant was really nice. Quite cheap too. Will definitely",
          "We booked through out holiday company so didn't know much about the park. I was surprised at how small it was in comparison to other ones we have been to on other islands. The rides themselves were great, one didn't open till half way through the day however once opened in was",
          "Visited on an overcast day. The park is small and looks old and a bit run down. A couple of good slides, but not enough for a whole day. Good that there were not many queues for slides. Bad point 5 euro for locker plus 5 euro deposit. Not cheap to go in - not value for money!",
          "We had a lovely visit to this park, our first time here. It was not that busy so that maybe helped our opinion! Not massively big, which was great for us so we could keep an eye on the kids but let them have their freedom too. It has a wide range of slides and is also good (and",
          "The park is very clean but we found it difficult to find via the satnav. Price on admission \u00a360 for two adults and a ten and 14 year old. Thought it was slightly expensive for a mornings entertainment.",
          "Great place, good fun for all the family. We went with our 11 & 8 year old. All slides good, not too much queuing (didn't go on slide for very young children). 5\u20ac for a locker with 5\u20ac deposit. Went with organised rep trip which was 114\u20ac (expensive and can do it cheaper using",
          "We unfortunately had our worst weather day while visiting Aguamar which no doubt colours my impression! Thunder and torrential rain closed the slides for a while and everyone dived for cover in the not very spacious cafe area! Lots of people left early as the rain got worse! A",
          "Good rides at the park you can visit and stay all day. The food was good for kids and well priced. The staff were sharp eyed and safety conscious. There were plenty of sun loungers and shady areas to sit. A good day out and well priced.",
          "Went on an organised trip by the tour operator and dissappointed to arrive about 11, no parasols left and no shade around the pools. Probably didn't help it was a Sunday so lots of locals there too. We went to a smaller waterpark in menorca which was much better laid out. There",
          "Went with 3 kids aged between 5 and 9 and would say it was a near perfect day out. It may not be the newest place in the world, have the latest water splash rides or be the place to go if you have late teens, but for this age (and slightly higher) it's brilliant. Kids loved",
          "Great fun well organised full day or half a day the kids love it plenty of eating areas so bring a packed lunch good value for money",
          "The Aguamar Water Park was a great day out. As someone who has not visited a Water Park before this day trip I thought this was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the day. I also feel that this was a good value for money trip. We took our two year old daughter on this trip and the",
          "This was a great visit. Make sure you get there for opening (10:00) as it quickly fills up and make sure you find a spot away from the entrance as there was a slight odour... The food was reasonable and priced well. The girls 4 & 6 loved every minute of the 5.5 hours we were",
          "Many people reported feeling sick after visiting this water park. In my opinion not good value for money. If you decide to go, go early and use rides, or else you could queue for 15 minutes. Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but can only tell the truth.",
          "My daughters had a good time at the park. The place is a small water park, not very crowded and quite clean. Good for half a day out.",
          "If you have been to Center Parks or Butlins, or any other water park then this is disappointing. The park is tired and old, the loungers, if you can get one are old too, the slides/rides are nothing to right home about either. Be aware of height restrictions, 1.10m and 1.40m",
          "Save ur money. Not much shade. Hardly any parasols. Only about four rides worth Queuing up for. And the traffic getting there and back was terrible but I guess if u put a couple of million people on a an island the size of a ten pence piece with one road then ur gonna get a bit",
          "We visited here as part of an exersion from our hotel. Although great for kids the slides/ pools do not offer much for adults. The park was clean and you have adequate changing facilities near the toilet area. One complaint would be the salty water throughout the park (including",
          "Kids had fun but it is in need of updating. The queues for food were long. The queues for an inflatable to go on the slides were long. The queues for the slides were bareable but organisation was poor. We visited the park from San Antonia so after a couple of hours there we left",
          "\"It is what it is\" as someone once said. Absolutely just what you want if you like water parks, but clearly not comparable with the very best. But it was clean enough, there are enough rides to exhaust a half day visit, and we had fun. Kids on our trip were 15, 14, and twin 11s",
          "We stayed at a local hotel and had paid for unlimited access to the Waterpark but one visit was enough. Whilst the slides were fun we all fell ill after visiting, my daughter especially so and can't help thinking it was the Waterpark as the food hygiene etc at the hotel we",
          "The only waterpark in Ibiza. Travelled with adults and family aged 19, 17 and 10. Having a 10 year old son who loves water, we had to visit the waterpark. Plenty of sunbeds. Enough slides to entertain for a few hours. Could do with a bit a TLC. There were lifeguards at all",
          "Was prepared by other Tripadvisor reviews for disappointments and yes the pool water was a bit salty, but I have been to much smaller water parks. The slides were all smooth and well maintained. With many varied levels- some including the corkscrew and the pink single slide was",
          "This is a fairly old water park, and compared to others we have visited in Spain is very basic indeed. There appeared to be no proper changing areas. Also, the location is bang in the middle of playa den bossa (Space is on the same plot) which is not really a neighbourhood you",
          "Quite a small park but about 10 amazing slides, 'the black hole' is the best one! Some you race each other, some you go down on a dingy together and some you're on your own. Plenty of life guards around. It's all out in the open so bring sun cream! Spent about 5 hours there and",
          "Ok so this waterpark is a little old, and there's no lazy river, and it may look a little tired in the photos however it delivers exactly what it promises. We took an 11 year old and an 8 year old and they had as good a time as they had in Disneyland. There are hundreds of",
          "A great waterpark for those with younger children. 7-8 different slides and a large pool and separate kiddy play area. Easy for a 7 and 9 year old to navigate on their own. Also decent pizzas and only \u20ac20 entry.",
          "the water park was quite small so that put it down but it was still fun the food there was okay but the pizzas are the best.also around the pool it was very prickerly so we cut out toes.",
          "Ivebeen to the water park once before I found it amazing and I'm going again this year in July and I can't wait the service is great and I thought the staff and workers were very nice and welcoming. Fab water park!!! Highly recommend \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Now I'm not one for reviewing but I did look at some recent reviews of this water park as my hotel was quite close. Despite the recent poor reviews my friend and I visited for the last hour of the day.... Amazing! Only 30 people on site meaning no queues at all. Okay... the park",
          "The access to it is a disgrace. There are height restrictions which were not pointed out before paying and this ruled out 3 of our grandchildren being able to use the best slides even, where applicable, together with an adult. The park was quiet which was hardly surprising.",
          "Although being hung-over from the night before I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Aguarmar. We arrived around 1:30pm, so halfway through the day, however did get to experience all the rides as it wasn't very busy. even though we arrive at this time we got a good spot with sun",
          "Loved this water park. The black water slide is excellent. Worth going back I suppose! On a hot day this is worth it.",
          "It looks a bit tired and not the cleanest Water park. Staff were also grumpy and not very interested.",
          "Went on a full day planed trip with the hotel, which I had paid for before we left so when getting to the hotel and finding out we paid nearly double was a little disheartening but not as much as when we get to the water park thinking we had paid to go to the bigger park of the",
          "we enjoyed it very much the children loved it more than us though. I would say the youngest one,s enjoy it more than the older end of the market",
          "Was a lovely holidays and me and the family enjoy so much, since the pools until the beach we had a lot of fun",
          "Whilst the big kids loved it (10 and 12) the facilities for the littler kids were broken or shut down. the entire place looked tired, flaking paint, a bit grubby and the staff in the kitchen were smoking - definitely not something you'd normally see! Expensive, drab and",
          "myself,husband and 11 year old son was so looking forward to an afternoon having fun in what looks like a fantastic water park (from photos) but when we arrived the whole area was very smelly then when we saw the state of the slides etc we was so disappointed so much esp with",
          "My first very waterpark. Its a small one but really good and fun day out espsh with kids. Lovely would definitely go back here. You get a photo when you come out of thr black hole slide. Bit pricey on the food there so take extra money or take food. As it's an all dayer at the",
          "Visited this park on the 26th September 2015 with my boyfriend while we were on Holliday in Ibiza, as I haven't been to a waterpark in a few years we decided to go and for a fun day out. Expecting it to be busy as it was the last day before it closes there was only a few",
          "Me and my Fiancee thought that we had brought tickets to the massive water park in Ibiza, but were clearly missed sold, we ended up at this water park which i found to be really small, we spent about 15 minutes going on the rides, once you have done the same ones over and over",
          "Me and my partner visited this water park as an excursion through Thomson and were very disappointed. We went on a Sunday and it was pretty much empty we went on all the rides once and a few of them twice but after that was left utterly bored. We were entertained for about 40",
          "The Waterpark is tired and the slides are dated, only worth a visit if you are stuck for something to do.",
          "I always took my children here when they were young. It is a lot of fun. The water slides are great. Have not been here for a couple of years, but I think you will enjoy it. We did.",
          "There are many different pools and slides for children of all ages. Lots of shady spots to relax and or pick nick with your kids or friends.",
          "The weather the rides the sun loungers are great just would be more enjoyable if we didn't have to pay to enter,AND then pay to sit down! Especially as I didn't go on a ride just got wet and watched the kids having fun",
          "This is an old Water Park, and quite expensive for what it contains. This place is well over due an upgrade.",
          "I visited this water park with my 2 young children. It was good value for money and all the staff were very good with the children. There are only about 10 slides but this was ideal for us as there are also a few pools for you to have a swim in. There was plenty of sun beds",
          "Great day out within walking distance from our hotel, not too big or crowded and great price. Our kids 10 & 12 love it there so much we went back again another day",
          "Read the reviews good and bad about this place before going. Can't understand the bad reviews. We went on the spur of the moment on a Monday, arrived at around midday. There were no crowds, hardly any queues, plenty of sunloungers. No signs of it being dirty (and believe me",
          "What a disappointment this water park was. Only 8 slides, but they can't all work at the same time. No swimming pool, wave machine or lazy river. The queues were so long, not enough rubber rings for the only slide that uses them. In fact there was a big shortage of lockers,",
          "Quite an old water park but some good slides. Some nice green areas for sunbathing. Changing rooms and toilets pretty old and tired. lockers are \u20ac5 plus \u20ac5 returnable deposit. Sun beds \u20ac2.50 each. A fun day out.",
          "we spent a day here and our 2 kids aged 8 and 9 loved it! They spent all day on the water slides and had a great time. You can hire a locker to store valuables and there are plenty of sun loungers around. The food was expensive but you come to expect that and you do have the",
          "Me, along with a group of friends, visited here and had lots of fun! It's not that busy so didn't have to wait longer than 2 minutes for each slide! It doesn't have that many slides but you don't get bored of the ones there we went on them 3 times each! The food was quick, cheap",
          "There were a number of big slides, so the kids enjoyed it. We arrived late in the afternoon, so it was nice and quiet. Overall though, I found it tired looking and a bit sad. It was quite expensive for four of us. I'd probably recommend this if you find you get bored on holiday,",
          "I visited this water park with my boyfriend through a thomson rep excursion. We we're both left very disappointed at the lack of things to do. There are not many slides meaning long wait times. The water was also not very clean looking at all. The slides are fairly run down, I",
          "OK for a half day trip but needs updating. Lockers expensive so get one for everyone and then get a hand stamp to go out for lunch and come back later.",
          "The water park was not far walking distance from apartments , it is a little out dated but still a good day out with 4 children to break up the pool / beach holiday with varying levels of slides for different ages",
          "Go early and in the week - we didn't have to queue for more than five minutes at all - lockers easy 5\u20ac and plenty of sun beds - picnic spots and loos! Excellent all round - lovely and clean too!",
          "Went to the water park during our stay in Ibiza I went with my mom dad and younger sister. As a 16 year old in my opinion i wasn't impressed to younger children such as my sister found it amazing as its a water park and there's slides etc. I think it was over priced for what it",
          "Was ok for the price. I have 3 boys who enjoyed it but got quite bored, not enough there. Closed one slide to open another, not sure if this was due to lack of staff or just the norm? Take your own food, queue was horrendous!!",
          "Very basic, out of date and small. There is very few slides and the young childrens slides have no way near enough water running down leaving children to push them self down. DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY LIKE WE DID !",
          "Been here everytime we've visited Playa d'en Bossa so it must be ok! Good points, plenty of loungers, parasols and the food portions from the cafe are huge! The rides are good and on the day we visited which was at what I would've considered to be the height of the season, it",
          "The water park needs updating, in the pool area the floor was peeling and I went 5 years ago and nothing as changed",
          "Have to agree with other reviews - water park is very small. Probably not upgraded for over 15 years. After the first hour my kids 16 and 8 got bored and we have decided to go back to the hotel. Expected more for approx 60 euro entry fee for the family of 4 people. Locker cost",
          "Loved this water park plenty of slides and sun beds to relax on. It's situated right net the busy area in playa den bossy which I LOVED plenty of shops to go in and even got to go to bora bro beach! Even after my shopping break we was allowed back in to the water park with the",
          "As water parks go it's not top of the list,it's basic really no exciting slides or flumes,but the ones they've got do put a smile on your face. They say that they charge for Sun beds but so far no one has been to collect any money! Changing facilities are basic and toilets are",
          "Ok so this water park hasn't been updated in the last 10+years it is exactly the same as when we went back in the day. Anyways we had 3 Adults and 1 child in our party! The child was three and he was free to enter park bonus! He went on everything except three rides which",
          "Great for kids, maybe not so good for the thrill seekers, but for my 9 year old she was able to go on everything and for my 8 year old who is not a confident swimmer he was able to go on most of the slides as they were not too deep. Plenty of sun beds available. definitely worth",
          "Small water park but we had a good day there. Queue for food was very slow but the quality was quite good. The slides were of a standard that both me and my partner who are not really thrill seakers were able to accompany our son on MOST of the slides. Well worth a visit.",
          "We went twice during our two week stay, it was quiet so managed to go on everything lots of times and the sun beds and parasols were free during our stay.",
          "Visited this venue yesterday on an overcast day. Well what can I say. I have been to several waterparks in my day and this has to be the worst. The place feels a little run down and in need of some TLC and a good lick of paint. No real thrill seeker rides. Changing facilities",
          "Aguapark is small, about 8 different slides. However there is no crowds, short or none queues, so we are always sliding down. Main pool is seawater . As its small we can supervise children easly. Food is good but long queue for a meal. Park bit overprice but sun beds are free.",
          "I've never been to a waterpark before but I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this one. The slides are fun and on some you could go down together, which led to my mum coining this as 'the group effect'. It was true though, being beached at the bottom of a slide upside-down and in the",
          "Slightly difficult one to review. Many of the negatives (small size, use of salt water old attractions) are accurate and for some people this may not be the place to go because of that. I can see why folks may not have the same view as me. If it wasn't quiet, then I would have",
          "Was a nice place to visit to get out of hotel. Not sure if we could have stayed there all day. There were a range of slides but it was a lot smaller than other water parks that I have visited in Spain with less to do. Close to bars and restsurants in the town so we went out to",
          "Probably the worst water park we've been to. Really small and not worth the money. Not enough slides for older kids. I recommend you take your own drinks and food as you have to wait for 30mins plus for food that's not that good and over priced. To top it all off we had our",
          "We paid \u20ac52 entry for 2 adults and 1 child. We stayed for 2.5 hours so not really value for money. The park itself is looking old and needs updating. My 7 year old son absolutely loved it but me and my husband were quite bored really. Not much for our 1 year old daughter.",
          "Ok for an hour or so but not a full day at all. Not many slides. Good location though. Right next to space.",
          "We weren't expecting a fantastic water park as we'd read other reviews which said it was pretty basic. However, we had a good day out. Our two boys had great fun on the various flumes/slides and we could leave them to go round themselves knowing they were perfectly safe.",
          "Good value. The kids loved it. (Ages 15 and 9). The water is sea water. But after the first couple of slides you don't notice it. Very safe. Highly recommended. It's says \u20ac2.50 for sunbed hire but no one was charging.",
          "I can see why the park is fun for kids - it's good for families as it's reasonably small so you can generally keep track of them. The slides aren't too fast so we didn't see anyone upset or scared. The downside is that it's a little small so probably not the most fun if you",
          "Don't get all the awful reviews on this one. Yes its not Disneyland but its a reasonable price for a family to spend a whole day, easy to keep an eye on the kids and they will be totally entertained. I found it to be clean (but maybe we went on a good day) Restaurant is ok, its",
          "Had fun here but I am told from others who have been to alot more water parks than me that it is very basic and others have a lot more to do. Bit dated, could do with some money spending on the place and a few more things to go on. Good day out for the family though!!",
          "Myself, son 13, daughter 16 and her bf 18 went on a coach trip from our hotel in Cala Llonga and only took 30 mins or so. We was there from 11 till 4 and it was plenty of time to use all the slides or lounge by the pool. It's not the biggest water park but there was enough for",
          "Very popular with families but great place to experience the thrill of the slides and top up your tan. Plenty of room, places to eat and drink. Would recommend if staying for a few days",

          "Me and my partner (both 20) came here for something fun and pretty cheap (\u20ac18) to do whilst on holiday. I'd been when I was about 12 and remembered it being great - whilst it didn't seem as big as I remembered, it was just as much fun. There are plenty of slides and a couple",
          "Good day out and not expensive food and drinks well priced slides all good nothing the kids can't use , only a short walk from the hotel Bahamas",
          "Have been a couple of times now to the waterpark. There is a good variety of slides (I would say its more of a family park than for thrill seakers!) The only thing that annoys me is that you have to pay for the sunbeds!",
          "Been here for years now I first went back in 1988 so good to see its still going. Huge big pool for the little ones to enjoy and watch out for the kamikaze ride as you feel like youre going to topple out so not for the faint hearted!",
          "Don't go unless with very young children. Only a hand full of rides... 18euro. Rip off. Water is salt water which was weird. Restaurant disgusting.",
          "A great day out for the family or with the lads/girls The parks a little on the small side but what it lacks in size it makes up for with a great all around day out. All the pools are family friendly and there's a bar and restaurant area which serves some good food. I for one",
          "We visited Aguamar water park as a young couple whilst staying in San Antonio bay. It is a very very small water park with a handful of slides available so we was definitely done within a couple of hours. Quite expensive to get in considering that this was the case as well. I",
          "Fantastic Place and Day out! Loved every minute! Will be back in the very near future! Visit if you have the chance!",
          "There are about 3 slides acceptable for adults to go on. After the 15 minutes it took us to do this we were bored. Que's are full of screaming children and we left after a couple hours as if you have no kids with you you start to feel like a bit of a peodophile... From a",
          "This waterpark is so underrated by reviews i have seen on here, yes is may not be the biggest waterpark in the world but you cant go wrong its such a fun day out. It's also only 18 euro entry!! You can take your own food drinks as there is a picnic area specifically for that but",
          "Very nice to spend the day. A bit pricey but good thing is you can take your own food and drink with you.",
          "Not the smartest waterpark we have visited on the island but reasonably priced and kept us entertained for the day. Good range of slides and play areas for the kids",
          "We enjoyed our day at the waterpark. It wasn't very busy so we didn't have to queue much for rides though I expect in the main season it gets very busy! The rides were fun and safely supervised. The water is salty which we weren't expecting but it is clean. You can take your own",
          "The place was empty so me and 3 friends literally had the place to our self. It was my first water park. Super fun & staff where lovely.",
          "A lot better than some of the reviews have said. It was tidy i dint see peeling paint. Great for money food was well priced. the only thing i would say was the water was very salty. Kids loved it dont tell them so did I",
          "Visited Aguamat yesterday 14.05.15. Had an amazing experience got a great discounted price for entrance as we are staying at the Palladium. The park was empty as we are pre Ibiza party season so no ques , to get on each side , however can only imagine when it's busy how long",
          "Been to this water park many times - good place to visit if enjoy water slides and it near the airport and on the flight path :D",
          "Was cold on the day we visited so we didn't have the full experience the park had to offer. Not as good as some water parks we have visited needed updating.",
          "Took our 2 boys here - one loved it, one didn't! If it's your thing, you'll love it, if it isn't, you won't!!",
          "If you are used to the great water parks of Florida, such as Aquatica, this place will fall short. However my family and I have come here many time and had great fun. it packs a fair number of rides into a small space and some are quite hairy It needs some love and paint in",
          "I remember being taken here by my parents when I was 8 or 9. Almost 20 years later it didn't really seem like anything had been changed or added at all which frankly made me a little bit nervous. That said it's still good fun and let's face it, there isn't masses of family",
          "Ok, it smells of kids and chlorine You have to park behind Space... At least there's no more daytime parties to negotiate past.. It's pricey The facilities look very old, dated and plenty of peeling paint But the kids love it.. So go for it, no regrets I promise",
          "What a fab day out, a top water park with a roller coaster, how cool is that!!! Prices are reasonable, and there is plenty to do there.",
          "Ok it's 18 euros to get in, there is literally 7 rides in the whole place. There were no more then 30 people in the whole place, mainly because the weather was really bad on the day we decided to go. It took us about 20 minutes to do them all. It's the kind of place that you",
          "food was resonable and drinks where 2 euro, the lockers was 5 euro and 5 deposit. the pool water was lovely and warm, would recomend for a cheap and chearfull day out.",
          "I have been to many water parks abroad, this has to be the worse! There are a small amount of flumes packed in a very small space. All outside showers are broke and paint is peeling off everywhere, it definitely needs updating! Extremely disappointed for the price (60 Euros+",
          "We had a great time here, yes it is a bit tired but what's there is fun and it was worth the entrance 10\u20ac for kids up to 12 and 18\u20ac for adults. Plenty of sun beds and pizzas for lunch nice and not a rip off.",
          "What a day out. Booked online before we left. Got there at 10-30. Left at 18-00. Great fun. Good food and drink from the eaterie. Slow service but good. Had so much fun all day. Clean and friendly.",
          "Mid August but not crowded at all. We had our choice of sunbeds. You could take your own food so we didn't feel pressurised to buy anything there. A brilliant day. Safety was obviously a priority and the slides were all in good condition.",
          "We came to aguamar for half a day just for a bit of fun. The entrance fee not too bad, but bring 10\u20ac for the lockers!!! A choice of about 8 bigger slides and a few really tiny slides for kids. Hence why we only stayed for a few hours, we got a bit bored.... The whole place does",
          "Been to better but my son enjoyed it. No decent swimming pool or wave machine. Choice of about 7 slides.",
          "Great slides for my age group of children 10,7,4, great small pool area. Restaurant good with plenty of choice. Not really busy even though it was august. All had a great day out.",
          "The water park is quite small but well managed and few queues. The park semed to be well supervised so was nice and safe. On the whole a good day out",
          "Kids loved it not queuing for long for slides shame 6 year old wasn't aloud on rubber ring ones. Pools very clean",
          "Not too expensive, but wouldn't have wanted to pay more. Sunbeds were comfortable, but struggled finding a parasol and then struggled to keep it open! Food was basic but quite good value, though you can take in your own. Shower rooms and toilets could do with a good clean and",
          "an hour is enough if you are over 16 better if you have young children between 1-5 as there is a play area and some of the bigger slides they can go on.18 euro for over 16s and 5 euros for a locker which should be free.",
          "was really good value , one of best we have been to, only grumble was that theres not enough beds so we had to sit on grassed area with no shade",
          "We had young and older children and they all enjoyed. We spent hours there without the kids grumbling they were bored. The water was very shallow so the younger kids were safe to go off and spend time going down slides without us worrying.",
          "Excellent will go back to this place. Lots of things for the kids and grown ups to go on. Not so good if you can't use the slides for any reason but you can paddle swim and sunbathe!",
          "We visited the watermark during the May half term, as we visited on the final Sunday & most families were flying home that day we literally had the place to ourselves, there were about 60 people max in the whole park. We didn't have to queue for a single slide etc, which our 9",
          "We visit Ibiza every year and our children (9 and 12) always insist on a visit to Aguamar. They love it and would, I'm sure, give it 5 stars. It's good for children 5+. There are fun slides and it's adequately maintained. Safety standards seem high. It's all a bit scruffy and",
          "I wasn't expecting Florida standard, but overall we were disappointed with the Water Park. It is small with maybe 8 rides available plus the pools & kiddie amusements. Apart from the place looking tired & shabby in places, what disappointed me most was that the water was salty!",
          "Quite small but perfect enough to keep the family entertained lockers for stuff \u20ac10 but \u20ac5 returned so we could all enjoy as a family",
          "Very good. We arrived as it's opened so no queues at all. By the time it became busy we had enough. Very good way to keep children happy!",
          "Its a small water park, a few slides & a kids pool. If you have kids on holidays with you it would be a good place to bring them because its not to busy. The staff were really cross & ignorant. When we asked to get the pictures of us from 2 of the slides they made out that they",
          "Make sure to ride Kamikaze!! Brilliant water slides. Especially loved the black holes. Free entry with our all inclusive deal from first choice. Plenty of sun loungers!!",
          "went to water park as part of a slide and seek Thomson tour, with hippy market in morning and water park in afternoon. Would say 2-3 hours maximum is enough as limited slides. Food and drink expensive so take your own. Limited changing facilities so go with your costume on.",
          "Found the price a little much for the amount of water rides on the park.....really could do with a little upgrade apart from that we had a good day",
          "This water park is great! we've been going here for years. The staff are top with safety precautions and are helpful. There are sunbeds and parasols, an onsite snack bar and lockers for valuables and also changing facilities and showers. The rides are fun and safe and the park",
          "Visited the water park last week and can't really complain. Don't go expecting anything amazing, it has 8 main slides, a nice shallow family pool and a smaller area for the little ones, however the best part is how quiet it was. Probably about 100 people in the whole park, so",
          "this park needs a good refurbishment.the rides are old and tatty.we got in for half price 9 euros per adult 5 per child .had i paid full price i would have been very dissapointed.",
          "For our family (2 adults and 4yr old twins) this park offered a great day out. It was very quiet on a beautiful day and no queues which is always a bonus. The shallow pool is fab for the little ones. The slides are very well staffed and controlled so safe. Hubby had plenty of",
          "was in a good location and kids enjoyed themselves alot plenty of different slides to go on and in well good view from sunbeds",
          "Good day out. There are enough slides to vary your day and keep you busy. We didn't get bored. There isn't a deep pool for swimming which was a little annoying, however the shallow pool is massive which is good for kids - and there is the ability to swim in that. Food was really",
          "We were staying in San Antonio and getting to the water park is a couple of bus rides away so can take a bit of time but we just got a taxi back which was \u20ac30. The park is good and we did enjoy it but there aren't a lot of slides or pools but we stayed for 4 hours and were two",
          "We went to Aguamar in late May and although the temperature wasn't too hot the park is sheltered so it feels warmer (bonus!). The water temperature was pleasant on the day we went - certainly warmer than I had anticipated. The slides were enough to keep our kids entertained and",
          "Loved that it wasn't busy despite it being half term, so plenty of goes on all the slides. V well stocked with sunbeds for those not into the waterfun!",
          "This was a very fun very cheap experience not many rides though could do with some more! They were all very fun though.",
          "At only \u20ac18 for the day it's cheap,we went twice, first day 64slides and second trip 65. Staff were friendly,food and drink was cheap \u20ac6 for a pizza. Will go again when. We next visit. Be good if it's topped open a little longer, even if it's just the first week of October.",
          "I Came here looking for a fun afternoon... The park looks like it's seen better days tired & worn in parts...bathroom was disgusting with no soap or hot water... I paid 18 euros entry and 5 euros to rent a locker which is extortionate.... water was so freezing I refused to swim",
          "The slides they do have are fun but it could do with a few additions! The black hole is probably the best one as you can't see anything on the way down.",
          "I'm in my 20's, I'm sure kids will love it, but there's not many things to do. You'll spend lots of time walking up the metal steps (scary!) there's not really any big pool you can use to have a proper swim either, just small kids ones",
          "Went here with my family it was a good fun food was good they had ice cold beers for the grown ups and there was lots of space for the kids to play and safe Only thing here make sure you take plenty sun protection it was red hot and there's little shade plus it's salt water so",
          "Aguamar isn't worth the price you pay to get in but it is a good day. Once in the water park you have to pay for sunbeds which we thought would be included in the price however it wasn't. The sildes are fun but depending on what day you visit the queue's are usually shorter. me",
          "This is a place to bring the kiddies so they can piss freely in the pool. If you are six years old, (mentally) or more, you will probably find this place disgusting..many beach I'd better and doesn't cost 18'Euros/head.",
          "Went here with our 2 children 5 and 11 months they both really enjoyed i thought there wasnt that much to go on but my son loved the slides and really enjoyed it here - we got in free with our hotel bands so the price didnt make a difference to us and we also took our own food",
          "The service could have been better. But the slides were brilliant and the faccilities and food were good.",
          "We paid 18 euros each in then thought we would have to pay 2.50 euros each for asun lounger but were told we wouldn't have to pay for them, think this was because the park was quiet. There were plenty of loungers and no queues for any of the slides and no over crowding which was",
          "It was a good water park but there wasn't anything very lively in there,when I walked in there I thought it's time to have fun but after about 3 hours I got a bit board because all the slides were just not scary and when I got back on the bus to go back to Fiesta Hotel Milord I",
          "water park was ok, only 5 minute walk from hotel, lots of sunbeds, a few of the rides you had to be a certain height so my son couldnt go on them.",
          "Before I start, I'm just going to take a moment to congratulate the lifeguards on their whistle blowing abilities. I counted 9 lifeguards on duty and at any one point during the day, at least one was blowing their whistle. Seriously, if you like whistles as much as I do then",
          "Went to this waterpark and found it very disappointing. Not that many slides and it seriously needs a lick of paint and needs updating. Think it is expensive for what they are providing. Life guards kept blowing whistles at the most slightest things but when a Spanish child",
          "Even though this place is quite old, everything was clean and looked well maintained. Lots of staff everywhere and flumes were well manned for safety. Got tickets from Thomson rep, \u20ac18 per adult and kids go free under 12. We got two buses from Santa Eulalia (changed at Ibiza",
          "Good day had at the water park, although it closed on the day that it rained for some reason unknown. It was very central and had plenty of parking.",
          "We visited the water park on the 19th August,altogether there were 8 of us 4 adults and 4 children one whom is disabled,the staff were good when it came to someone waiting at the bottom for the children,but after an hour we had done everything in the park and the kids wanted to",
          "Had a nice day at the waterpark, my son loved it even though he was disappointed that he couldnt go on the slide with the rings as he wasnt tall even, but he enjoyed the other slides and the pool area was very nice, could do with a lick of paint and the changing and locker rooms",
          "Excellent for all ages. Very Clean. Plenty Sun beds and on hand medical staff. Also plenty shaded areas.",
          "Went in august with my 12 year old boy it looked like it could do with modernising and a good clean in some areas we had fun though its something we always do on our holiday is the water park, he didnt find the rides scarey enough tbh but thats kids for you there is fun to be",
          "Went to AguaMar water park for my third or fourth time. Most of the slides were fun especially the foam ride. Only reason it's not excellent is because its a very old water park and needs to be upgraded because I haven't seen a change since it opened. No idea when it opened. I",
          "fun for all ages, great day out, sun loungers available, food available, lots to do, keeps children entertained for hours",
          "A tad tired with limited changing area and not too many slides for the price (and 5 euros for a small locker). Note the three main slides have 1.4 meter height restrictions. Overall it was ok and my 5 year old enjoyed it.",
          "We came here as a day trip with a First Choice excursion with high hopes. The trip had cost 130 Euros, so we were expecting a good time to be had. What a disappointment. Firstly, the whole place is in serious need of a lick of paint. Secondly, the actually slides (which",
          "Visited 16.8.13 with partner and five year - price is extremely high 46 Euros for the three of us and when you get in this really is a tired and sorry looking attraction (if that's what it's supposed to be) very rundown, not many water rides/slides for kids and badly needs some",
          "We went with young children ideal for them, large pool and plenty of sunbeds. Older children may be disappointed as only four main slides",
          "Needs updating and painting, some of the water features weren't working, foods was great though and plenty of beds and parasols",
          "Not the biggest or the best waterpark in the world but I think most people are aware of that before arriving. Myself, partner and 11 year old daughter bought tickets through our tour operator Thomson which was \u20ac17 per adult & a free child which was saving around \u20ac15 on the door",
          "We had a fun time, but a lot of the slides you had to be 1m 40 which my daugher wasn't - which was disappointing, can't complain tho' as we had free access through our hotel",
          "Great fun for all the family. Reasonable prices. Slides, chutes and safe pools. No charge for loungers or parasols.",
          "this was about \u00a317 to go.... we went out of season, before schools broke up for summer holidays so we didnt have to queue once for the rides.... they were fun, but if i had to have queued for a long time i would say not worth it.... all the rides could easily be done in less",
          "Good fun day out for kids & adults. Larger rides sitable for people over 1.4m tall. Sunbeds were free on the day of my visit! Lockers available for hire. Food & drinks available to buy",
          "There were plenty of sunloungers but not enough parasols for shade. There should be one to every 2 beds especially on the outer terrace where there are few trees. The toilets at the far end of the park (not the main ones) were absolutely disgusting, they did not flush, there",
          "we loved the water park, very good part of our all inclusive used it about 5 times we loved the blue slides and the black hotel, life guards were really helpful with your dinghys ;)",
          "Would highly recommened taking a visit here. About a dozen rides to go on, plently of pool area, spacious locker rooms and loads of sunbeads. Also the ham and mushroom pizza in the restuarant area was LOVELY i've gotta add. Overall a lovely day out x",
          "needs updated been the same for 9 years nothing new most people get stuck on slides and have to push them selves down",
          "Nice for an afternoon out,clean but food and juice can be expensive,there is lockers for any valuables plenty of sun loungers for sun bathing,there are plenty of chutes for all ages swimmers and non swimmers its only a two minute walk away from fiesta don toni and there are",
          "We visited the Aguamar water park in Playa D'en Bossa on Wednesday 3rd July 2013. Myself, partner and 2yr old daughter went with an organised trip through Thompson' holidays ( Hippymarket then water park ) We arrived at the water park about lunch time to find that the Kamikaze",
          "We stayed in playa d en bossa in june, and had free entry here whilst staying at the fiesta don toni, it was my kids who are 4 and 2 first time abroad and they loved it here, it is small with about 9 slides, but it was perfect for them, there is height restrictions and my eldest",
          "We went there having booked it with our hotel as we stayed in san antonio which is about 30 mins away . We had lots of fun when there but after about 4 hours we were getting bored as we had been on all the slides a couple of times and been in the pools , the park is aimed at",
          "not enough slides, there are around 8 so not enough variations and big queues, the food was expensive, the water very salty and the merry whistle blowers they are a joke, we took the kids who don't swim brilliant and when we went to get them it was like being in one of the",
          "Booked this through a travel agent ot our hotel so it included entry and coach there and back. It's situated next to the airport so as we were staying in San Antonio Bay it took about 35 mins to get there. Pleasantly suprised to see a relaxed large area with good slides.",
          "We went aguamar through Thomson, the park itself is very big however we did spend around 5-6hrs there and really enjoyed ourselves. Its great for adults, teenagers, and small children. In future we wouldn't do the excursion through Thomson as there were 5 of us and would have",
          "Only has about 4 or 5 slides. Got in for free as was splash world with our hotel don Toni. Would not have visited if we did not get in for free",
          "We stayed in Playa d'en Bossa for only 5 days in June, for mostly just chilling out with a bit of partying in the evening. this water park is ideal for just popping into for an hour or two. i wouldnt recommend buying a sun lounger and all that, as there are about 7 slides, and",
          "We went at the end of May and had the place to ourselves. Loads to do - even our littlest child enjoyed the smaller set of slides he could go on. We walked there from Ibiza town. Playa d'en Bossa looked a dump (a bit like Blackpool, but with sun) and the walk back to and from",
          "We went to the water park just round coner from our hotel one day a group of 3 familys with children from 1 yr old to 14 years old and 4 sets of couples (21 - 62 yrs old) we paid on arrival at the gates with no queue arrived at 11.30 am, we didnt pay for sun beds as it said",
          "This place is my 3rd favourite water park, so many rides so many options, really nice food I could go on really the staff are all nice, to get in it is a bit pricy and they use sea water.",
          "As the title says... I had a lot of fun ont he dingy slides and the flumes, especially the one where 6 of us could go down at once!! Let down by the DISGUSTING taste of the water (albiet it looked clean) which I seemed to swallow a bit of each time I came out of a slide....",
          "This waterpark is good for families with young kids, the staff are very strict which i think is a plus and in the little pool for the younger ones some of the staff where really good with the kids.",
          "This has to be the worst waterpark in europe. Seriously, I have been to dozens of waterparks; some great ones and some decent ones but this has to be the worst by far! The place should be demolished and a brand new, modern one built in its place. This place has to have been",
          "Lovely day for sun lounging a hangover off and acting the big kid on the slides. Friendly staff, Bus stops outside, clean, good to explore the area too.",
          "Went here last week for a day out with the family, had loads of fun, there arnt many slides but the park was clean, wasnt overcrowded, didnt que to get on anything, sunbeds were lovely (and free) food wasnt too expensive, all in all a good day out",
          "Good family day out. Food ok. Plenty of lifeguards on each ride or pool? Lovely picnic area. Downside, you are on flight path!",
          "We had good prices to get in - Thomsons were offering half price entry throughout May (don't know if this extends though) A good few slides on offer, really enjoyed the black hole, foam and the colourful toboggan. Our day however was overshadowed because of the weather, it was",
          "Paid \u20ac17.50 what a waste of money. Stayed an hour. Went on two slides all I could taste was salt water which I could have forgiven until I went in the main pool and it was filthy, leaves acceptable but bits of dirt floating around I could not. Once again tasted of salt water. We",
          "slides were poor. Tube slides made of metal with no flume of water through them, meaning you stuck to it and burnt yourself.",
          "Very close to hotel.. Pools were very clean Toilets were groce!!! Sunbirds very expensive... Best to go early then avoid paying in the afternoon!",
          "I came here in 2011 then again in 2012 while holidaying in Ibiza, and I can safely speak for our group ( 22 - 24 years old) when I say we had a great time, made us feel young(er) again! The place was clean, all of the slides were open and great variation, staff were friendly,",
          "Not as big as I expected but definately had plenty of entertainment for kids. Adult log flumes weren't too bad either. Love the fact that its free access during our stay at Don Toni as well. All in all a good waterpark",
          "Had a good day out here, worth a visit. Slightly expensive but plenty to do. Good day out for the family and over the road from our hotel!",
          "visited this as part of an excursion through thompson. It was a great day and I thoroughly enjoyed it! lovely pool, scary slides and all in all a brilliant day. If you walk out of the park there are a range of bars which are much cheaper than the waterpark..and if you get a",
          "Went there as on the website it stated it was open until november but it shut in october. At the begining of the month so if you have children they will be disappointed! Theres nothing in the area of playa den bossa in october, so make sure your hotel is nice as you will be",
          "you'll get wet and have a brilliant time. Lots of sunbeds to choose from for those who want a break from the water.",
          "It was ok, a standard water park but needs updating a bit. Some of the rides were fairly new but there was a lot that needs taking down & re-newing. Don't let my review stop you going because it's ideal to waste an afternoon here",
          "we made are own way there so easy to find and something for all ages to do my two eldest loved it age 8 and 6 and my husband loved it two while me and my new born chilled in the sun by the pool what a fab day out. got to go its brill",
          "the waterpark isnt brill theres only 9 slides and two of which are float ones where you go down in pairs on rings you can go on all of them in a hour or less depending on how busy it is but we didnt have to wait that long to get on the slides (2 mins) but the food isnt that",
          "Been here a few times when staying at Playa den Bossa, good thing being on the doorstep and great for kids. Value for money however needed a bit of updating when we went last a few years ago in 2009, may have changed by now??!",
          "It was great, very clean with lockers to keep your valuables in. There were some big slides and a nice area for the little ones. Also a small playground for the younger children too. Well worth a visit, we stayed in the attached hotel so were in there everyday.",
          "The place has not changed over the last 10 years and is looking a bit tired now. However, it still provides a good day out no matter how often you have used the same old rides. It needs to upgrade its shower/ changing facilities though. People expect better nowadays after",
          "Great family day out, the kids loved it. Lots of fun rides. Needs a little updating and a few more slides adding. We have visited many waterpark and even though the day was good we have had alot more fun in other waterparks, definitely needs and lazy river! Food quite pricey.",
          "The water park was very clean had lots of choice for all ages, plenty of sun beds and parasols, a snack bar and large clean toilets and changeing room facilities",
          "The slides themselves were very good fun but there weren't all that many. Also some of the joins in the flumes weren't very smooth and made it a bit uncomfortable. The toilets, bar area etc were run down and not all that clean, wouldn't take small children here. Mostly good for",

          "WaterPark is smaller than expected but still great fun, although there are height restrictions of 140cm on some flumes, although you cant understand why. It is a holiday park for younger children, may not be enjoyed as much by teens.",
          "i feel that other reviews were very harsh. yes they were strict on the heights with some of the slides but having a child that was shorter than the restricted height he was allowed on al but three of the slides- the 2 tube slides and the Kamikarzee but we fully enjoyed the park",

          "Lots of slides and things to do. No real swimming pool though. Very relaxed, plenty of space but you do have to pay for sun beds.Entry works out to be better value for money than paying for sunbeds and umbrellas on the nearby beach given the activities available.",

          "The slides and pools are spotless and there is mostly something for all the family! The slides are great fun and vary so it is not boring. The pool is great for a leisurely swim and there is lots of sunbeds to lie on if you need a rest or if you are just not into the slides!",

          "Absolutely brilliant for us as it was included in our hotel reservation and was only 5 - 10 minute walk away ; Be warned lockers cost \u20ac5 charge and \u20ac5 deposit; If you use the sun beds a cost of \u20ac2.50 per day",
          "very disappointed with this waterpark. paid 90 euros for entrance fee and transport but was not worth the money.although you could leave the park to go into the town. constantly heard planes flying overhead all day long.",

          "We visited this waterpark while staying in Playa den Bossa. We took 2 children aged 7 and 11 and they absolutely loved it. It was small enough for them to wander round and queue with me watching from a distance to take photographs. It definately does need updating as it looks",
          "I think it cost about 20 Euros per adult and maybe half that for our 6 year old. You get charged 2 euros per sunbed. There are really not that many slides in comparison with other water parks but of course they dont give an indication of the height restriction until you have",
          "not suitable for younger kids,(under8) as there are no small slides for them, also there is no shade for you to have lunch under and there is a charge for using lockers of 5 euros which is surely a rip off",

          "Drove to the water park and found it quite difficult to find, no signs and drove round in circles until we stumbled across the park! Bought tickets in advance so didn't have to join small queue to get in and saved a bit of money. Have to pay for sunbeds (3.50 euros I think).",
          "Brilliant day for all the family, rides were quieter in the morning and got busier in the afternoon. We went mid week as were advised the locals go at the weekend",
          "Its a small waterpark but we were there all day and didnt have to queue for more than a minute. Would happily recommend",

          "went here for the day and paid 18euros for adults, 10 euros for kids, not too bad, but was unhappy that after paying 10euros for my daughter she could hardly go on the slides as she was too short. Was very surprised as we went to Greece last year and she was allowed on nearly",

          "my son is 1.3 meters tall, he needed to be 1.4. he was allowed on most of the slides alone but the slides with the inflatables and his dad, not allowed, found this strange. ordered a picnic from the hotel, overall a good day",
          "Top water park, totally recommend it. Free entry and sunbeds free, drinks expensive though, 5 minute walk from the Hotel, very handy.",
          "Took a trip to the water park from San Antonio Bay, cost us 25 Euros to get there by taxi but we could have travelled by bus. Had a brilliant day there relaxing in the sun and going on all the slides, loads for young children to do and the lifeguards are quick to spot and flag",
          "Its 18 euros to get in but if you stay all day, it's not too bad value for money. It's not massive but a good selection of slides and a nice shallow pool.",
          "Food wasn't great but you can get your hand stamped and go off site for something.",
          "This is worth a visit,but you could only get half a day out of this max",

          "We had access via staying at hotel. This is not a bad waterpark and was very quiet (mid week in June) when we went. So no queues. We spent about 2 hours and had been on all rides twice. Not bad, but not too sure I would have wanted to pay full price. Nothing really wrong just",
          "Great for kids, Food good we went in mid june so going on the slides there wasnt much of a wait.",
          "Friends 9 year old daughter has tons of swimming medals but because she was:nt quite tall enough she couldnt go on certain slides, yet none swimmers could",
          "Needs works as it looks very dated and scruffy, we took the kids and they were not impressed, not value for money",
          "went here last week for a day - it was the best day of our girls holiday, so much fun, less then 5 minute wait for the flumes, friendly staff, clean and they have lockers, sunbeds, parasolls etc. highly recommend. they open from 10am, best to go early :)",
          "Brilliant! Slides are really fun for children and adults.. and photographs are taken on some of the water slides which you are able to buy. Food/drink is fantastic also :)",
          "Not much for the younger ones, or smaller than 140cm, but would imagine older kids would love it.",
          "Waterpark looking a little faded but still lots of fun and worth a visit.",

          "busy a weekend quieter weekdays excellent and lots of life guards on duty",
          "Some of the reviews on here made me think twice about visiting but Im very glad we did cos we had a fab day and the kids absolutely loved it, even though there was 2/3 rides they couldnt go on as they werent tall enough, 1.40 m is the height for some of the rides, however still",
          "this is the only water park on the whole island at the moment it is a great place for the whole family. loads of different kinds of slides big pools and seperate areas for just relaxing and enjoying the sun.",
          "good day out plenty too doo our kids loved it plenty of life guards very safe.food staff a bit miserable no greetings or smiles",
          "The park is quite spacious with plenty of sunbeds but there are only about 8 water slides, which become tedious after a while.",
          "only went because it was included in the holiday, would not have paid the entrance fee, not enough slide for m 7 year old. you had to be 140cm to go on most. which seemed a bit bonkers.",
          "it was very quite.and about 5 minutes walk away.sun loungers there were 2.50 euros. my children loved all the slides.I believe it was about 8 euros for a child to get in but because we stayed at the fiesta we got free passes.well worth a visit.will go back again but wouldnt pay",
          "Not too busy, bit expensice for adults 17 euros. Could do with a couple of new slides. Very clean, very safe",

          "Tired and dirty and expensive especially if you're taking the family",

          "Good water park. Got half price ticket from our hotel so it was a great price if you want to only spend half a day at the water park.",
          "We had free accss to the Aguamar for the whole of our holiday - it wasgreat for my older daughter but my younger daughter could only go on certain things. But all in all we had a fab time whenever we went.",
          "Great, free entry to the resort due to deal with local hotel. Kept the boys playing for hours. Salt water gets in the eyes, but all part of the fun. Rides looking a bit dated now, and the plastic is sun bleached but does the job.",
          "Not a very big water park, but enough to keep the kids occupied for a couple of hours. If you have unlimited entry when you book, it is worth going for an hr or so every day, to break the day up",
          "Enjoyable with the exception of the kids pool, where the slides are not slidey....",
          "A great way to spend a couple of days with the family. We got free passes from our hotel so don't know about prices but it's def something to do if you've got kids with you.",

          "5 euro non refundable lockers ! water park ok but hard pressed to stay a full day",
          "It was a lovely park, well planned out. An area for younger children and a area for older/adults. There is no shop here to access drinks or food. The slides are very well supervised by the lifeguards. Children are measure to ensure they are suitable for each of the slides.",
          "What a great day out. Plenty of cool spots by the water and thrilling rides for some action.",
          "After a couple of hours, we'd had enough. Done all the rides. Needs updating, looks quite shabby,",
          "We bought a ticket through our reps. It was about 50 euros. That included our transfer there and back too. However the water park did not have very good rides. It was mostly for children. The toilets were not very clean as well. Not worth the money. My friends thought it was",
          "A water park while in Ibiza? Hell Yeah. It was great fun to go with a group. Bit crazy! Check out their new website and book tickets online too, a good deal and saves you time!",
          "and we only paid half price that should give you an idea of how bad it was.",
          "All clean & lovely. The park wasnt that busy as the season hadnt started which made it bettr, hardly any queues for the slides & the food was cheap & reasonable!",
          "A good fun day out. Several different slides & places to sunbathe. Burger & chip bar which was ok for lunch",
          "It looks small when you get in there, but there are plenty of different slides to go on and the park is very flat, so you can practically see the whole site - which is good as you can keep an eye on your kids. Good for kids AND the grown ups!",
          "A small but fun waterpark. You can buy food inside or bring your own. Life guards everywhere to look after kids. Not too busy.",
          "I have been here twice. Its really good! But Once you have been on the 5 or so slides it can be a bit boring doing it over and over again but its great for kids. You can only do it so many times but its great for half a day etc Top tip: get there early and get a good sun bed",
          "Very run down and terrible food. over priced and over crowded.",
          "me and my friend decided to go to the waterpark one day when we were winding down from the night before, we were staying in what is now ushia hotel and just walked over, i think we paid about 20 euros to get in for the day. Was good fun, we went on all the rides, didnt need to",
          "I'm not a person who likes waterparks, but the kids loved this park, plenty to keep them busy, for hours, i found the areas around the pools to be very clean, with plenty sunlounges to sit and drink coffee on, while the kids played",
          "A bit small and a little bit tatty. Park cost about 18 eauros which is OK and you could stay until it closed at 6.00pm. Crammed in behind Space Disco so no real views of anything. OK for younger teenagers with about 5 decent rides. 4 hour max stay I would reckon before you get",
          "it takes nearly 1hr to get to from the sirenis sea view, but is a great fun day out",
          "Its the only one on the island so if you have kids Im sure they will want to go and they will have a ball. There is only about 5-7 shoots and a large pool. After you pay the high (I think it was alot) enterance, you will find a sunbed.......after a few hours a lady will ask for",

          "Not many slides, and the water is salty, this just makes your eyes sting all day and is very unpleasant. Don't sunbathe on the grass - lots of ants! The dingy rides were fun. Wouldn't go back!",
          "we booked the excursion to aguamar from our hotel in portinatx with thomson, when i asked the rep she said it would be fine for a 13 month old baby as there was a baby area.... i paid 37 euros each for the two of us for an hour and a half at the hippy market and just over 2",
          "If it looks like rain or given in forecast , don't go, you will not not get a refund, food is expensive and poor quality take a picnic, sunbeds will be charged for. water activities are limited but good fun for all family. keep an eye on toddlers.",
          "We had free passes for the aquapark with our Hotel (Don Toni Club) which made it excellent value! We went 4 times whereas if we had to pay 50 euros for a family of 4 for one day we would have only gone once. It wasn't ever too busy, good mix of slides. I liked that the pools",
          "Water park is very outdated now and in need of a re-vamp. It is a great day out and good fun, kids will love it but as a parent I was glad when we left, the slides are old and rusty, the stairs wobble and are extremely slippy as they are concrete or steel and of course always",
          "We paid the best part of 50 euros to enter, and stayed for about an hour -couldn't stand any longer than that -certainly not somewhere to spend the day! My 7 year old loved it, although he wasn't able to go on everything because of height restrictions which was great because he",

          "Visited the water park with my 6 & 8 year old boys who both had a great time. The minimum height for the bigger slides was 1.4m which was a bit of a disappointment for the 8 year old but had a good time on the 5 slides he was allowed on. Drinks and food reasonably priced.",

          "We have been to other aqua parks in europe and found this one to be in need of an overhaul. For instance no lazy river, not enough fast rides. Queue for food ridiculously long we watched some people queue for upto an hour.",
          "We visisted the park in July 2011 as part of an excursion with First Choice. Dependeing on where you are stying in Ibiza this is not a bad way to combine park and entrance fee in one. I think its the only water park on the island The park is well laid out and have 9 main rides",
          "We loved this water park, lots of slides and places to swim and lounge about in the water. Plenty of space to sun bathe (although you do have to pay for sunbeds) and just an overall really good fun day out!",
          "Arrived expecting it to be expensive to get in (which it was) but the rip off doesn't end at the gate. You have to pay for sun loungers and parasols once inside (should be part of the admission price given what you're paying). We stopped for 2 mins on some seats by the cafe to",
          "Was absolutely horrible. Paid 17 euros to get in. Then had to pay 10 euros for a locker, which you get 5 back when you hand your key in. Sun beds are \u20ac2.50 each! Were dirty plasters everywhere. The water was FREEZING and it's salty so when you go down the slide and it goes up",
          "As with another reviewer, we had tickets for this park included as part of our holiday package, and was a reason for choosing our hotel. We visited at the beginning of the season, and it wasn't really busy. The staff at the bar were not friendly. The kids were really looking",
          "i took my 2 yr old son to this park this summer. we went on the very limited rides available. the on ride which is quite high with the very wide lanes was where the problem arose. the life guard at the top informed me that we had to go down seperately, as we went alone he",
          "We stayed in a hotel at playa d'en bossa which had entry to the waterpark included within the all inclusive hotel price. As it was a very short walk away we had intended to visit a few times as this was one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel. As it was the hotel was"

          "The waterpark is small compared to others that i have visited although we did have lots of fun. It is very dated and poorly maintained. The paint around thr pool was all melted and peeling off from the sun and water. A refurbishment is required but it was a good day for the price",
          "Nice little water park just by the ANTZ held hotel, selection of different slides appropriate for different ages. Plenty of sunbeds and quiet grassed areas. Bar and food court reasonably priced and a first aider on site and lockers",
          "A great way to spend a whole day",
          "Great day out.. bit pricey @18 euros each",
          "Great wee water park. If You've been to wet n wild or blizzard beach you'll probably be bored but if you've kids that have been doing your nut in all holiday, go here and set them loose for a few hours. For adults would recommend getting a \u2026",
          "Great water park and reasonably priced",
          "I went this afternoon. The park is average for its location and would make a good day put for kids ..\nIt has a few slides and could do with some more daring slides as it is aimed for the under 10's which is fine.\nThe food is reasonably \u2026",
          "Brought my kids here for a fun day...was greeted by the most depressing looking person who just wanted to take your money. The changing rooms are really old and dated with smelly toilets and nowhere to actually get changed. Then again \u20ac5 to \u2026",
          "My son always loved it!!\nThere are: Black hole, spiral slide, super multi color slide, foam slides, kamikaze, children and infant pool and much more.\nPrices: Adults 18\u20ac, Children 10\u20ac",
          "This place is perfect for those who have children up to the age of about 14. The slides are great, plenty of sunbeds and hardly any queues for the slides",
          "Limited number of slides and quite dated. That said it was clean and worth the 20 euro entry for adults 13 for children. All in all ok and worth a visit.",
          "Love it . Just enough for kids . Food nice and reasonable.  Had good time",
          "Moody staff serving food and vefy poor food. But the other staff very friendly and great fun just take a picnic and you will have great time",
          "Very good park for youth. small but that's great because you can get to slides easily. Nice mix of slides. And not so busy (at least when we went 1st week of September). Good fun with young ones.",
          "It was an amazing experience for me.. the life guards were really helpful..",
          "Nice clean waterpark, queues aren't that long. Only downside is the lack of slides / splash zone for toddlers",
          "Its ok 2 hours though and your bored we got free unlimited tickets so went about 4 times each occasion we left after a couple of hours worth a visit id say",
          "It's ok for the kids but a bit out dated food isn't the best either. Quite expensive",
          "We are adults, and it was ok for us 8 of us. ;)",
          "Kids said this was the highlight of the holiday and want to go back for our last day. Although small and dated in places it was a great day out. Sunlounges a plenty and if you\u2019re a plane spotter you\u2019ll love it. Lifeguards very attentive.",
          "One of the best water parks i have ever been to! Large number of different water slides, also the ones with the use of inflatables etc. What is more there is a quite cheap restaurant on site as well as few toilets, showers and one large locker room. Will probably come back!",
          "Get there early for sunbeds, slides are fun even though a bit dated. Some slides hurt your back where they have joints. Food took a long time to get which wasted a lot of our limited time in the park. We still Had a fun day though and would recommend.",
          "Quite small so be prepared to queue for 20-30 mins for the higher slides, we took a picnic to avoid waiting for the single food bar which can also have long queues. Generally clean and well kept. My kids enjoyed it but we probably were there for 3 hours max.",
          "There is only 7 slides had to stay for 5hrs was done in 2 and half hours thats with eating lunch",
          "Great place to enjoy but needs to be bigger. Also needs to sort out the food arrangements. 30 minutes from ordering to supplying the food. That is 30 mins out of your day plus the eating time so you lose an hour at least.",
          "Great water park for the children! We had fun as a family .. cheap food average quality... some slides need to be updated as shabby!",
          "Been coming here for over 25 years and it hasn't changed apart from a few extra slides. Dont let that put you off as it does what it says it does with no fuss. Kids will love it & parents can get their head down for a few hours while the \u2026",
          "Huge fun. Well run.",
          "Had a 5 year old with us. No advice before we went to then find she was too small for all of the larger slides have to be 1.4 metres  leaving only toddler slides and 2 at 2 metres long. Would have been better staying at hotel pool.",
          "Fun day for the family.  Not expensive.  Large menu for the restaurant.  Worth visiting",
          "Nice water park. Not too expensive. A bit dated but still had great fun",
          "Not a great park but really good entry price so great value for money. With kids 11 & 12 it lasted half a day. Kids \u20ac10 each in high season.",
          "Not open when it says it will be.\nLong walk and disappointed children \nGoogle can you please check the opening times?!",
          "Very good not over crowed .Had a good day .the food bar could be organised a bit better all round not bad",
          "Not a lot there for the price",
          "All of the slides barely had a que although it was busy. The slides are all really good fun. I recomend the pizza as it is amazing for only \u20ac6. Anyone going to ibiza should go here.",
          "Great water park but outdated",
          "Fun day for kids and adults, but really needs some investment. Please update equipment is been the same for 30 years...",
          "The kids had a great time... aged 10 and 5...\nBut it's is very out dated ... and looks shabby... and not very many slides so you easily do everything very quickly. . And get bored after a few hours...no where near as good as other water parks I have visited abroad before",
          "Beware...It is a seasonal park.  Only opens in may.  We went in April - Google.said it was open but it wasn't...wasted 15 euro on taxi.",
          "Fairly small in comparison to some of the water parks in other resorts. Not too bad on price but you'll only get a few hours fun here as the slides are limited.",
          "Great for both adults and little ones",
          "Noce gery nice",
          "Amazing place used to go here as a kid still the same and I get to take my kids this year to it. Can't wait \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Limited rides but whats there are very good, the facilities, toilets, showers and food bar etc, were excellent.",
          "Good day out. \nNo deep water for diving into\nA little dated, no wave machine",
          "Great loads of slides and my kids had a brilliant time",
          "Not so good. Looks great from the outside but is dated on the inside. They use salty water everywhere, even in the showers that only burst water for 4-5 seconds. Not a good place to hang around.",
          "Had a great family day out, all of us enjoyed playing on the slides. Slides and water areas for all ages. Definitely worth a day out. ",
          "Great day out for the family, several different slides and the kids had a ball,only downside was I had to queue for 30 mins to get some drinks and ice creams as they only had one till for food and drinks",
          "I thought this waterpark was ok  some slides didn't work there was one slide that I really liked ",
          "Great water park for smaller kids, enough to keep them entertained for many hours. Food is top notch and there are lockers to keep things safe. Parking is free.",
          "It's good but keeps closed in the beginning of the week :(",
          "Fab waterpark, perfect for all the age groups 8/12/16 that were with us",
          "Really good fun.  Enough rides safely run.",
          "Lovely place very reasonable prices as well. #5*",
          "Had a great time. Needs more sun beds and a bit of a tidy up in places",
          "Arrived at 4.00pm but still had to pay full price. Should only charge half price after a certain time.",
          "Nice day out ..a bit dated but still loads of fun. Avoid the 'chicken ' burgers !",
          "A bit old fashioned but still a great way to spend a day with the kids!",
          "The slides were awesome.",
          "Small, salt water, run down. Kids had fun but gutted this is their first memories of a water park. Disappointing.\n\nOn the plus side food was good and they had lucozade which satisfied my craving!!",
          "Absolute dump! Definitely not worth the entry fee. The place was filthy, inadequate facilities for little ones, the water was salty and dirty and half the rides weren't open.",
          "Kids love this place. Make sure you bang loads of sun cream on though as it's a right old sun trap. ",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Kids loved it there",
          "Closed till 25th May according to workers",
          "Ordering  food to slow water park needs upgrading staff not very welcomeing",
          "Wouldnt want to go for a whole day there isnt enough to do the kids got bored after a couple of hours. In dire needs of updating its looking old and worn. Everything is expensive inside the park too!",

          "when entering the park you are greeted by the most depressed looking man , the park is a good day out for the whole family but a bit dated ,there has been no reinvestment in 10 years . The lifeguards are very bad with children a smile \u2026",
          "Nice place , good fan, need to pay an extra attention to the children.",
          "Ok",
          "Very nice place.A lot of fun.",
          "Really not the best water park compared with the rest in Europe. Not many flumes or slides and very dated.",

          "Not that busy mid July and the rides a lot of fun for adults and kids.",
          "Nice, fresh and compact park. Children can have fun all day long. Good and strict supervision, so that nothing is left to chance.\n\n",
          "Great place to spend a wonderful day, large areas sunny areas and shaded areas. There are several games for children and adults. Clean bathrooms, possibility to deposit bags in lockers. Recommended\n\n",

          "After 3 visits, I confirm that the staff is really very efficient and friendly to both the toboggans and the swimming. They are not there to watch our children but to ensure their safety but some parents do not make \u2026",

          "A very nice place to share with children\n\n",

          "Attentive staff Very aware that nothing unpleasant happens. Highlight kindness and good treatment. Some of the facilities need a little more paint.\n\n",
          "Not recommendable. Nothing has changed since 30 years. Everything old and dirty. A real broth is floating on the water and even feces are floating around. There are hardly any shady spots. There are about 20 umbrellas \u2026",
          "ideal to spend the day with the pekes\n\n",
          "Nice slides just not much .. nice place to relax on a song behind on the lawn under a palm tree.\n\n",
          "It's okay. It's fun, but they don't invest anything and the facilities are in very bad condition, the steps slide, the non-slip straps are broken and loose, everything is very neglected and in very bad condition. \u2026",
          "It is very fun and the staff is super attentive. It is one of the best attractions in Ibiza for children and families. I do not put 5 stars for the little maintenance and the zero investment in the attraction. The bar \u2026",
          "Fun and more with the kids\n\n",

          "Do not even think about eating at the Aquamar restaurant, I have not seen a bar so badly run and with which I think he is the boss, a macho and nothing apprentice. Do not blame the kitchen, you have the fault for this \u2026",
          "The restaurant system is a bit badly organized, but it is fun and if you have a good mood and know how to have a good time you enjoy it a lot!\n\n",
          "Old park, not entrenched.\nUnpleasant staff especially those above the slides ....\nPainting peeling everywhere, rust on the stairs.\nExorbitant price for 5 toboggans\nShort park to avoid .....\n\n",

          "A great place to spend the day with the family. The food prices are not bad but they do American menu. There is a lack of maintenance in the slides because you can sometimes see the joints but it can be harmful. Not \u2026",
          "Good water park to spend the day with family or friends. Since the day they opened it, it has barely undergone changes and the facilities are a bit old. They always say that they will close it and that this is the \u2026",

          "It is a pity that it is in the conditions in which it is. I have good memories of my childhood there, the other day I took my daughter and she is completely the same. She had a good time but the lack of arrangement, \u2026",
          "Site highly recommended to spend a fun day with family or friends. Of course, it could have some more maintenance and modernization.\n\n",
          "Great day ... simple but very good\n\n",
          "A fabulous family afternoon. Children and adults have a great time. A good family plan to change the beach. That if a facelift would not go bad to those facilities.\n\n",
          "A classic of Ibiza ... a little old and lack of modernization but entertaining .to go with family or group and have fun\n\n",
          "It's good for me to go with the children, although it's true that it has not been renewed for years and years. You have to think about the people here who go every year and not only in the tortuous ones that go once \u2026",
          "The slides have their years and there are very few floats, every year there is less so it's time to wait for a good time on each slide\n\n",
          "The slides are not in very good condition the truth. The stairs when you go up makes the black slide are all full of rust and the wooden shed is rotting and I do not think that that is very safe to change it \u2026",
          "Very good water park, there are options for all ages. They could be renewed from time to time and putting news\n\n",
          "As often written here unfortunately no good address for a pleasant stay. The slides as such are completely OK and provide the children with plenty of fun and variety. However, the entrance fee is not appropriate to \u2026",

          "A great day we have spent as a family, but it needs some maintenance\n\n",
          "To spend a day with the kids is great. The bad thing that looks very old, would require a reform.\n\n",

          "A beauty dreamed place\n\n",
          "I spent a whole day and had a great time, but I have to admit that they should renovate the facilities and slides, most are too old and lacking maintenance\n\n",
          "The park has been the same for 25 years, it needs an important reform. They abuse that in Ibiza there is no place like that\n\n",
          "It's okay, but it's old-fashioned, they still have the same attractions 25 years ago, most are for children over 140cm, there are two for children over 120cm, and a small water park for babies, costs \u20ac 10 for children \u2026",
          "The gardens are very well to celebrate a birthday, you can also enter with all the food and drink you want, what the pools and slides are all very old, would need a good remodeling.\n\n",

          "The park is unfortunately getting very old and the inflated entrance fee not worth\n\n",
          "He is careless although that does not mean he has a good time with the children. They should give you a general review and improve and update the facilities.\n\n",
          "They should renew it a bit, there is a bit of lack of control, perhaps they would need more vigilantes, they can not cope\n\n",
          "the lifegards are horrible me cousin was a yellow slide on that slide you have to tire after a bend he fell off the band when he again wanted them they they exspres fan fell off the band (which was not so) he was not \u2026",
          "It is fun\n\n",
          "Good place to spend the day. You can take your food or eat there. There is enough surveillance for children. A renovation would not do him any harm. That's why I only put 3 stars\n\n",
          "The facilities are a bit obsolete ... although they have a good area with lawn and shade and being able to bring food from outside is comfortable. .. on the other hand the discount they make to the residents is \u2026",

          "Bored a little\n\n",
          "This cool but it is a bit expensive entry to be so old-fashioned, it's fine if you've never been, do not have many \"attractions\" but to spend the afternoon is fine.\n\n",
          "The fun here was number one. Larger queues for attractions. The water, which is presented here as sweet, is in fact salty even in chlorinated water washing showers. The food here in the bistro here is below average. \u2026",
          "Entertaining, but you need a good coat of paint. There were areas with peeling paint and a lot of rust. The good news is that you do not usually have to wait to ride a lot at the attractions.\n\n",

          "Never again Aquamar, actually a great location + great parking but it's all old and broken. We paid with Tansport + entrance for two persons 82 \u20ac and it was worth 0. After an hour we were totally bored, the staff \u2026",

          "No no no. The second time I would not go there. You can leave, but everything is dingy, unrecognized. Just ugly, deck chairs covered with bird's income.\n\n",

          "What fun\n\n",
          "It's fine to spend a family day, but you need a lot of reform and a lot of cleanliness. Since they opened it (at least 20 years ago) they have not done any of that ...\n\n",
          "The children have a great time. However, the maintenance is harsh and angry. Cracked stonework, rusted stairs to the not too fresh slides and sagging sunbeds.\n\n",

          "This worked well for what we wanted for an afternoon on the beach. No charge for the beds, good burgers and a couple of bottles of cava. Prices for some of the food was excessive but the burgers at 24e and cava at 29e a bottle seemed reasonable for the location. Service was a bit slow and uninterested.",

But like they say in Spain \"tranquilo\" just sit back enjoy your drinks and absorb your surroundings. Good music playing drinks following and good sunny weather. Will definitely visit it again next time.",

          "Amazing beach, views, luxury beds, food and drinks.\n\nRidiculously expensive - but they can charge it given the location. \n\nIf you get a cab out there make sure you plan your exit - almost no taxi service locally, expect a wait of over an \u2026",

          "Four stars because the beach is very nice, the club part is very pricey for the service. The waiters do put a lot of effort, but mostly because of the place extension it takes a lot of time to get orders. Waiting 40 minutes for a 17\u20ac, albeit good, cocktail at the end of September does not feel right...",

          "The torres itself was nothing to bother going for but if you go down to the stony beach below there is lots of picturesque views to be had. Quite awkward getting down though so be careful. I had flip flops on and managed it so wasn't that bad if you found the right place to",

The village of Sant Josep de sa Talaia is 7.0 miles (11.3 km) east of the beach.

A 420-room hotel and 18-hole golf course were planned along with a desalination plant to provide the drinking water for such a large development. The island's green movement known as GEN-GOB  began a campaign to stop the development in 1992. After many years of objections and legal wrangles the development, much to the greens amazement, got the go-ahead in 1998. The GEN-GOB decided that a more proactive measure was needed and they took their arguments against the development to the island's people through an organised protest march. The protest was organised for January 1999 and on that day eleven thousand protesters marched through the streets of Ibiza town. The local politicians quickly realised that his representation made up 14% of the islands population. This wave of opposition helped to sweep the ruling PP party from power. In August 1999 the local government put a stop to any development plans. The Cala d'Hort National Park was created in February 2002.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Ibiza (Spanish: [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]; Catalan: Eivissa [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]; see below) is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\nIbiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe official Catalan name is Eivissa (locally [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]). Its name in Spanish is Ibiza (pronounced [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]). In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish ( eye-BEE-th\u0259, ih-), whereas in American English the pronunciation is closer to Latin American Spanish ( ib-EE-z\u0259,  ee-BEE-s\u0259, and so forth).\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (Phoenician: \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0c, \u02beB\u0160M, \"Dedicated to Bes\"). It was later known to Romans as Ebusus. The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityo\u00fbssai (\u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"Pine-Covered Islands\").In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum), and wool.\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Moors in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of D\u00e9nia\u2014the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community\u2014and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia during some time (11th century).\nIbiza together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon, and Alc\u00e1cer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.The island was conquered by Aragonese King James I in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities.\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. At \"God's Finger\" in the Benirr\u00e0s Bay there are some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost six times smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the \"Pitiusas\" or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\n\n== Administration ==\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Majorca.  Ibiza comprises five of the community's 67 municipalities. Clockwise from the south coast, these are:\n\nSant Josep de sa Talaia (Spanish: San Jos\u00e9)\nSant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio Abad)\nSant Joan de Labritja (San Juan Bautista)\nSanta Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo)\nVila d'Eivissa (\"Ibiza Town\"; known simply as Vila, \"Town\")At the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated 147,914 by the start of 2019, and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nIbiza has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering on a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), while the average low is 14.3 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and very dry, with few rainy days, often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.7 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F), while the average low is 8.1 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.3 \u00b0C (87 \u00b0F), while the low is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 \u00b0C (67 \u00b0F) and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe typical folkloric dance of Ibiza is Ball Pag\u00e8s. The origin of these dances is unknown. Nowadays, this tradition is in the process of recovery, thanks to the efforts of different Colles of Ball Pages of the islands.\nThe clothing of the dancers is very colorful. The speed of the dance can be slow, medium or fast, although Sa Llarga, is the most danced way, and it's fast, dynamic and energetic, where the male dancer jumps around the woman and lifts up his legs.\n\n\n== People ==\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2019 had reached 147,914. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears \u2013 IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch, in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the expatriate population (Rozenberg 1990).\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francol\u00ed was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: English punk musician John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious), the psychedelic rock band Philiac, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving, and film director/actor Orson Welles.\n\n\n== Language ==\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, like English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore and Sant Antoni to the West.\nNight life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Privilege (formerly Ku), Amnesia and Es Parad\u00eds. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music.  The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy, and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\nThe season traditionally begins at the end of May, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza\u2019s clubs over the course of a three week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three day conference which has taken place on the island every year since 2008.\nClosing Parties signal the end of the clubbing season, taking place at the end of September and into the first two weeks of October. Nearly all of Ibiza's clubs remain shut during the winter until reopening the following summer.\nA typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and \"disco sunrises\". Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehavior from young adult tourists, it has acquired the sobriquet \"Gomorrah of the Med\". Also well known is Caf\u00e9 del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by Jos\u00e9 Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers, such as Patrick Topping, Carl Cox, Green Velvet, Jozeff and many more international artists.\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIbiza has been featured in the racing game Test Drive Unlimited 2, in which the player can drive around the entire island. The game also features the island of Oahu (Hawaii's third-largest island).\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley, Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel, A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank, They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene, and The Python Project by Victor Canning. Memes Eivissencs also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone. in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast.\"Because of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots.  A monument (\"The Egg\") erected in honour of Christopher Columbus can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Llu\u00eds Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andr\u00e8s has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).  In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\" which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.Ibiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect in 1 July 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi) not much more tourism can be supported.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Majorca, D\u00e9nia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eul\u00e0ria, and Figueretes\u2013Platja d'en Bossa.Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town\u2014every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eul\u00e0ria.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nIbiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as flaons. Other savory dishes include sofrit pag\u00e8s, bullit de peix (fish stew), arr\u00f2s de matan\u00e7a (rice with pork) and arr\u00f2s a la marinera.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHead, Barclay;  et al.

        "wiki": "Portinatx (Catalan pronunciation: [pu\u027eti\u02c8nat\u0283]) is a small urbanization, formerly a very small fishing village, on the island of Ibiza. It is located 1 hour from the island airport in the municipality of Sant Joan de Labritja and is the most northern bay on the island.\nPortinatx is a remote part of Ibiza, making it difficult to get to other parts of the island. There is a scarce bus service to Ibiza Town (bus number 20 [1]) and Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (bus number 21 [2]), however they only run every few hours in summer and twice a day in the winter season. There is also a boat service to Es Canar and Port de Sant Miguel, but again the service is infrequent and expensive.\nBesides, if you live in Portinatx you will have everything you need. In this town there is a tobacco's shop, many restaurants and supermarkets. You will always have something to do and if you ever get tired of society just go for a walk around the beach and all your problems will vanish. In summer time people go there to relax and enjoy the sea and the views, it is true that Portinatx is expensive during the summer season.\nLandmarks include the Punta Moscarter Lighthouse that is 1 hour walking from Portinatx center and 20/30 minutes by car. Like most of Ibiza, the surrounding countryside is heavily forested, as opposed to the more bare neighboring islands of Mallorca and Menorca. The town is shadowed over by sa Descoberta, a large wooded hill rising up to roughly 250 metres above sea level.Portinatx is family oriented rather than a party place, with warm seas off of its small beaches that remain shallow for some distance, and with a few shops, rare bars and small number of places to eat of various national cuisines and price brackets.  It has three cash points.\nIt is claimed by the Ibithencans (natives of Ibiza) that Portia was used in several outdoor scenes during the filming of South Pacific.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Back in June, on a package holiday to Ibiza, an excursion was available to Portinatx. Our rep described it as a pretty little northern town and beach, but with \"not much there.\" That probably describes it - a bay with a scattering of bars and restaurants around it.",
          "We visited the small beach for a day trip. The beach was clean as was the surrounding area. But when swimming in the sea we found it to be very smelly of sewerage. I understand this is being dealt with but all the same was not pleasant.",
          "Great clean beaches, friendly locals. Enough shops to wander but not enough to spend a fortune! Very pretty small resort great for families certainly not for those looking for a club scene. Get a cab from the airport for \u20ac50 and enjoy the 40 minute transfer. Worth walking round",
          "Amazing holiday. We decided to go to ibiza on a whim whilst trying to decide on a last minute Dummer holiday that was within a reasonable budget. Nothing extravagant or too post just something with a bit of the typical sea sun and sand. We didn't choose portinatx in particular",
          "We visited Portinatx by bus while staying in a different part of Ibiza. We arrived at lunchtime and found there to be a good choice of restaurants. From what we saw, it's a small village with a couple of good busy beaches. It has a small water park and there was a mini-golf",
          "I loved Portinax and so did my friends. We stayed at apartmentos australasia, I wouldn't recommend these apartments as they were dirty and staff were rude but we loved, loved,loved the town. I will return at least once a year. The beaches are stunning and quite small in size,",
          "Not loud at all, away from all of the clubs but close to some night life like bars and restaurants with plenty of entertainment. The beach is very nice although does become overcrowded. All in all, we enjoyed this place very much and would go back.",
          "Fantastic small beaches and shallow water which is great for snorkelling, and if you stand still-the fish will nibble your feet. We were at the 'Petit' beach. Initially, no lookie lookie men but they did appear later very annoying especially when the signs clearly say no",
          "Great sandy beach but not many restaurants/bars. It's a rather hilly resort to the North of the island. Great for families with kids."

        "wiki": "Ibiza (Spanish: [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]; Catalan: Eivissa [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]; see below) is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\nIbiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe official Catalan name is Eivissa (locally [\u0259j\u02c8vis\u0259]). Its name in Spanish is Ibiza (pronounced [i\u02c8\u03b2i\u03b8a]). In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish ( eye-BEE-th\u0259, ih-), whereas in American English the pronunciation is closer to Latin American Spanish ( ib-EE-z\u0259,  ee-BEE-s\u0259, and so forth).\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (Phoenician: \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0c, \u02beB\u0160M, \"Dedicated to Bes\"). It was later known to Romans as Ebusus. The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityo\u00fbssai (\u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"Pine-Covered Islands\").In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum), and wool.\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Moors in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of D\u00e9nia\u2014the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community\u2014and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of D\u00e9nia during some time (11th century).\nIbiza together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon, and Alc\u00e1cer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.The island was conquered by Aragonese King James I in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities.\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. At \"God's Finger\" in the Benirr\u00e0s Bay there are some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost six times smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the \"Pitiusas\" or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\n\n== Administration ==\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Majorca.  Ibiza comprises five of the community's 67 municipalities. Clockwise from the south coast, these are:\n\nSant Josep de sa Talaia (Spanish: San Jos\u00e9)\nSant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio Abad)\nSant Joan de Labritja (San Juan Bautista)\nSanta Eul\u00e0ria des Riu (Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo)\nVila d'Eivissa (\"Ibiza Town\"; known simply as Vila, \"Town\")At the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated 147,914 by the start of 2019, and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nIbiza has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering on a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), while the average low is 14.3 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and very dry, with few rainy days, often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.7 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F), while the average low is 8.1 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.3 \u00b0C (87 \u00b0F), while the low is 22.2 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 \u00b0C (67 \u00b0F) and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe typical folkloric dance of Ibiza is Ball Pag\u00e8s. The origin of these dances is unknown. Nowadays, this tradition is in the process of recovery, thanks to the efforts of different Colles of Ball Pages of the islands.\nThe clothing of the dancers is very colorful. The speed of the dance can be slow, medium or fast, although Sa Llarga, is the most danced way, and it's fast, dynamic and energetic, where the male dancer jumps around the woman and lifts up his legs.\n\n\n== People ==\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2019 had reached 147,914. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears \u2013 IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch, in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the expatriate population (Rozenberg 1990).\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francol\u00ed was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: English punk musician John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious), the psychedelic rock band Philiac, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving, and film director/actor Orson Welles.\n\n\n== Language ==\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, like English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore and Sant Antoni to the West.\nNight life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Privilege (formerly Ku), Amnesia and Es Parad\u00eds. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music.  The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy, and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\nThe season traditionally begins at the end of May, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza\u2019s clubs over the course of a three week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three day conference which has taken place on the island every year since 2008.\nClosing Parties signal the end of the clubbing season, taking place at the end of September and into the first two weeks of October. Nearly all of Ibiza's clubs remain shut during the winter until reopening the following summer.\nA typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and \"disco sunrises\". Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehavior from young adult tourists, it has acquired the sobriquet \"Gomorrah of the Med\". Also well known is Caf\u00e9 del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by Jos\u00e9 Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers, such as Patrick Topping, Carl Cox, Green Velvet, Jozeff and many more international artists.\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIbiza has been featured in the racing game Test Drive Unlimited 2, in which the player can drive around the entire island. The game also features the island of Oahu (Hawaii's third-largest island).\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley, Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel, A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank, They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene, and The Python Project by Victor Canning. Memes Eivissencs also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone. in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast.\"Because of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots.  A monument (\"The Egg\") erected in honour of Christopher Columbus can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Llu\u00eds Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andr\u00e8s has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).  In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\" which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.Ibiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect in 1 July 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi) not much more tourism can be supported.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Majorca, D\u00e9nia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eul\u00e0ria, and Figueretes\u2013Platja d'en Bossa.Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town\u2014every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eul\u00e0ria.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nIbiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as flaons. Other savory dishes include sofrit pag\u00e8s, bullit de peix (fish stew), arr\u00f2s de matan\u00e7a (rice with pork) and arr\u00f2s a la marinera.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHead, Barclay;  et al.

          "it's a nice stroll up the hill, and a very nice and probably the most interesting church to visit on this island. with its white walls it is a great picture from all around, and the construction itself is more then just interesting. we were here on the Sunday of the local Saint",

          "This church is a must-see if you are in Santa Eulalia. It's clearly guided along the roads. However it's a small and steep road to the top, but you can save yourself some time if you're there with the car. It's a small church but it's continuously opened and you can see here",
          "We followed the walk up the river an through the market gardens past the old bridge and water mill. Brilliant panoramic views from the top and a lovely church.",

          "We walked along the river to get to the Church which was very pleasant and although its a little steep to get to the Church its well worth it. The church itself is lovely but the views are amazing across Santa Eulalia. We timed it right as the church was open as it is only open",

          "Beautiful, humble looking old church from the exterior. Lovingly maintained. Then take a whirl round the gardens and stumble upon the crypts. Not your everyday occurrence. Not mine, at least. Step into the cool, dim interior and view the rather ostentatious altar and the fake",
          "We visited this little white church on the hill on 16th june. It was amazing, so beutifull and serin. If you are staying in Santa Eulila you must visit this adorable church. We went up in the early evening and the lady's where cleaning. It was so peacefull. And the insides are",
          "A white church on a hill. Great views of the bay. I can't comment on the church for religion is not on my to do list.",
          "Went inside as you do for a look. Before we knew it in walked the local priest and started a service. We stayed and observed this with interest. The church itself is pretty plain but around the alter is quite exquisite. Due to respect of the servivce I didn't take any photos. I",
          "The walk was not as hard as it first looked but was well worth it, the view is fantastic from the top and it is beautiful up there.",
          "Visited both the church and the museum. Walked up via the road to explore the church and then called into the museum on the way down. The museum is well laid out with both information cards and videos in a variety of languages. There is a small charge of \u20ac2 per person",
          "Took a walk along the river, past the watermill museum than up to this church from our hotel in the Siesta area of Santa Eulalia. Well worth spending half a day doing this. Very pretty church with good views of the area.",
          "We initially missed the entrance steps, the appear to look like they go up the side of someone\u2019s house. We did see others driving a good bit of the way up if you can\u2019t manage the climb on foot. Great views as you continue to climb to the top. It was quiet, not many other",
          "Immaculate building and surrounding area. Beautiful alter and church fittings. So peaceful and the church is open daily. The views are splendid of the local area. The climb to the church was gentle. A cafe close by would have been appreciated.",

          "We walked here from our hotel in Santa Eulalia, only took us about 25 minutes. We were there by 09.15am and was well worth coming first thing. We were the only ones there and it\u2019s incredibly beautiful and quiet, with breathtaking views and an authentic Ibizan feel. We wandered",

          "It\u2019s the original and old town of Santa Eul\u00e0lia del Riu. It is a really cosy and nice church surrounded by old Ibizan villas and houses. The walk to Puig de Missa is nice and easy to do. I really loved it.",
          "Nice church at the top and a pleasant walk if exploring the area. Good panoramic view if looking for some thing different from a promenade walk. Steep in places. Cemetery also.",
          "Rated as a top attraction and as an avid church visitor we walked up. The walk is lovely and takes you through what feels like a very traditional area. The church has a very impressive altar but feels very morbid inside due to the contrast with the bright white walls outside.",
          "My husband and I wandered up to Puig de Missa one weekday morning. It was a stunning walk along the canal with a gentle climb upwards. There were about 30 steps at one point but they were in the shade, and as it was morning, we didn\u2019t get hot. Inside the church is peaceful and",

          "I went via the old Bridge for a 2 in 1 walk it took a couple or 3 hours in total I also had a look at the museum. So it's well worth the trek. Had a look in the Buena Vista's Hotel on the way down. It's basically a numbered circular walk with information plates all along the",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you're staying in the neighborhood. From the town you should take the walk next to the river upstream. It's a small historic and peaceful place. Don't expect to see much more than the church. Views from the top are ok.",
          "Quite a steep climb to the top but worth it for the view of Santa Eulalia. There is a road & steps (whatever your preference). Take some water to keep you hydrated.",
          "One of the oldest churches on the island, and worth a visit. Very nice walking route including the church can be found in and around St. Eularia, well worth the effort.",
          "Very easy to find either with maps,phone or the numerous signs dotted around resort.we walked up winding road that had lovely views.we did not pass anyone on way up.lovely old church.on way back down we saw steps that took us back down to main rd in a third of the time. Though",
          "If you're in Santa Eulalia do make the effort to visit. A short but slightly strenuous walk, about 10 minutes from the bus station. Worth the effort to see some local history and beautifully tended graves, done the Spanish way. Lovely views of the area too. On your way down, do",
          "An example of history on the island on a small scale very informative. Views were excellent from the location. The nearby watermill, part of a local tourist trail worth a visit.",
          "Mrs Sloth has a dicky ankle and neither of us are as young as we used to be so it was with some trepidation that we took the uphill walk to have a look see. I'm so, so glad we did. In the midst of all the excess and opulence that goes with a resort holiday it was good to take a",
          "The church was closer than expected and not too bad a climb. There are a number of routes to the top, some with steps and some along a road (not sure if you can drive up there). The church is very nice, small and tranquil. The hilltop houses are nice and there are some really",
          "The pleasant walk up the small hill was very interesting and well explained by notice boards at regular intervals. A leaflet is available from the Tourist Info Office in the town. We continued to the Can Planetes - a small visitor centre near the river, with a working",
          "Lovely location and worth the visit. There was a christening in the church when we visited. The graveyard is also worth a look.",
          "From the hotel and including some of the river walk it took us about 3 hours, my wife used a walking stick, and takes extra care on the steps but she managed without any problems. The church is quaint and the gravestones reflect the surroundings. The view from the top are good",
          "After a steep climb the views are fabulous.The church is beautiful inside a lovely peaceful place in the grounds and cemetery.Also a museum to visit. A toilet is also available within buildings by the church.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful spot atop of a hill overlooking the town of Santa Eularia. We found a small dirt car park on the edge of town from which to walk from, it was well sign posted. Great views from the top.",
          "Walked up the hill from the town to Puig de Missa. Lovely little church and interesting museum (\u20ac3 per adult admission to the museum) with video showing the production of olive oil amongst other exhibits from early times on Ibiza.",
          "Worth the walk up the hill to see this interesting old church, there is a museum of local life next door which is also worth the \u20ac6 entrance fee, after all you have made the effort to climb the hill haven't you",
          "We chose to visit here on a cooler cloudier day as we knew that it was quite an uphill track ( can be accessed by taxi but felt the climb was part of the experience) once we reached to top the views were stunning but the church itself is beautiful as well as the surrounding",
          "We have been coming to Santa Eulalia since 2012 and have never visited this church previously, but after reading reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to give it a try and we are so glad we did it was beautiful. The walk up the steep hill wasn't as bad as we had thought it was",
          "We followed the river walk and stopped off at the flour mill on the path that leads to the back of the church. Beautiful views and the altar is an amazing piece of art.",
          "Went for a wander on a rainy morning and enjoyed fine views of the Santa Elulia peninsula alongside the church which was rebuilt in the 16th century.",
          "This is worth seeing. Church is up a hill but its worth it. Fully clothed statues in the Spanish style and a lovely old graveyard. Spiritually nourishing place to spend an hour.",
          "Stunning church on the hillside of Santa Eularia. There is a lovely tourist train that takes you up to visit this church and also a bar which is well worth the 12 Euros. The view is amazing and the church and grounds are stunning.",
          "We had a nice stroll up..the views on the way are beautiful...really is a beautiful place to visit..when we got there it looked like it was closed but all open and free to wander round on your own..you can also lite a candle for 1euro",
          "That's about it, very quick walk up a hill, there's a church up there, done. Not even very high. No biggie.",
          "Lovely morning walk with brilliant views. Also great place to see the sunset. Amazing little church knowing that the locals years ago walked to mass on a Sunday from all around the local districks.",
          "A long walk from the town but I believe the road train goes there. Not much there, nice views though.",
          "This church sits on top of a hill with great views over Santa Eulalia. Its on a circular walk that follows the river and is well worth the walk up the hill.",
          "We walked to Puig de Missa quite early in the day, quite easy to find and the views from the top were wonderful, the little church was amazing.",
          "What a lovely place to visit!!! The walk up to the church via the river is beautiful and when you get to the top there is so much to see. The church is beautiful and all of the houses round about are so interesting. The flowers and trees are gorgeous and the little side paths",
          "Lovely little church, rustic to look at but rich inside. easy to get to.Uphill but good exercise! Great views.",
          "Take this walk as it is beautiful going there and the place itself is so serene. If I die (within 100 years\ud83d\ude09) and for the churchyard... I want to be buried over there, there is no nicer place to leave this world.... Although I not intend to do so very soon\ud83d\ude02",
          "Visited this area last week. Very interesting, the old part of Santa Eulaiia. No cafes here though so take water.",
          "The Puig de Misses in SE is a real gem. Firstly, the views are amazing. Best time to take photos are early evening-the sun is in the perfect place. Most of all, for a little pray in my case and a few minutes of quiet thought, contemplation and solitude-it's so quiet away from",
          "We decided to take in a little bit of Santa Eulalia one cloudy morning as a break from sunbathing and glad we did. The walk up the hill is a little steep but worth it. The views are stunning. The church itself is really beautiful. We also visited the museum up there which is",
          "A short walk from the town centre - all uphill but with places to stop for a breather. Fantastic views when you reach the top. Come back down a different way - all lead to the town.",
          "I would encourage visitors to do the picturesque Riverside walk (get a map from the tourist information office) which culminates at this beautiful little church. I am not a religious person but even I felt close to a presence up there! The views over the town and bay are",
          "Well worth the climb up the steep roads for the breath taking views. Also visit the museum which was told the story of the early Iberians.",
          "We have been to Santa Eulalia many times and didn't know about this church. Situated on a hilltop overlooking the Town, Marina and Siesta it is short climb to get to it but well worth the visit. The views from outside the Church are breathtaking and the Church, although simple",
          "Great place to visit with views over the town and sea. Bit of a hilly walk for some but worth it. The church itself is very picturesque with an usual grave set up of tombs. We heard the bells on a regular basis.",
          "A beautiful Catholic church at the top of a short hill easily accessible from Santa eulalia town. Great views from all around.",
          "Beautiful view and picturesque church and small museum. Often there are artists there painting the beautiful surrounds.",

          "Heart of the old town placed on a small hill sorounded by trees and fields. I enjoyed the old street, little church and other buildings. The view of St Eularia and the shore is breathtaking. The etnographic museum opens at the end of April. There is a little farm with goats and",
          "A lovely stroll along river following signs to the old church. Beautiful panoramic views from the top of the town of Santa eularia and coastline.",
          "It's a 16thC fortified church with good views from the cemetary. It's worth a visit, though the uphill walk from the town on a hot day won't suit everyone. In terms of architecture, there's nothing world-class here but it is pleasant nonetheless. The porches are a more recent",
          "Beautiful in its simplicity, this is well worth a visit. We were lazy and took a taxi to save the climb!",
          "Myself and my partner went on a walk and found this place by accident, it was a serendipitous moment. The views from the top are stunning.",
          "We were on holiday in October it was a little cloudy so we went for a walk, decided to go up to Puig de Missa it was a very nice walk and a beautiful church great views over the resort and beyond.",
          "A quaint church built around 1560. White washed stone. Lovely views from the top. Easy to get to. At night can be seen clearly from the bottom as it is well lit. Really nice and definitely worth the visit",
          "We followed the walk from the see front and after a little walk uphill we arrived at the beautiful church, great views of sant eulalia, well worth the hike up",

          "If your fit enough it's a good walk and worth a visit. Interesting story about the church and it's history.",
          "Worth walking up the hill for the great views. The little cemetery is lovely and the museum at 3 euros is worth a visit.",
          "Wandered up here after lunch in town and it was great. Easy to get to, well sign posted, and lovely view (much better than the view from the castle in Ibiza Town). Definitely recommend!",
          "Nice walk up. Not too difficult and well signposted. Thankfully visited on s Sunday and the church was open. There are many different ways you can get there from Santa Eularia. I didn't visit the museum - looked closed",
          "Beautiful church with lovely view. Steep walk but can get the road train. Great information board to enhance your visit.",
          "A simple, and ancient, church. Magnificant altar but plain in other respects. Sits on a hill and, thus, affords great views over the bay. Walk from town or go to the out-of-town end of the Promenade and follow the river. Whichever way you go you'll still have a fairly steep",
          "This is reached from the Hotel by going all the way to the far end of the sea front and following the lovely river walk to the old bridge.About a 40 minute walk - take water with you.",
          "Quite a long walk but worth the effort. Easy to reach and street directions easy to follow. beautiful white church on the top.",
          "Quiet a hike to reach the Church and certainly not a trip for the less mobile or in the heat of the day!",
          "Bit of a climb to reach this church , yes it's on top of a hill ,but well worth the effort , great views going up and down , inside the church ~ well you will need to visit to appreciate",
          "Well worth the walk up to it. So peaceful & quiet. Fantastic views, We go up every year without fail.",
          "The church has a fortified outer wall facing the sea to deter pirates. It is at the top of a short sharp climb. Inside it is a traditional Spanish church. The views are spectacular over the town of Santa Eulalia.",
          "Lovely small church on top of hill with nice interior , great views over the bay and unusual cemetery . Lovely walk up by riverside walk from end of promenade",
          "Delightful oasis of peace and beauty , don't miss puig de missa Geddit ? Typical ibicenco building , organically composed cubist forms under an azure sky",
          "Well worth the walk or to have included in a local tour .. beautiful small church in the traditional style with stunning views over the island. Would benefit from a multi lingual guide sheet with a little explanation as to history and origins. If you are walking, take your own",
          "More historical information needed to make it more interesting. It was 30\u00b0C + on our trek. Take your own water.",
          "Puig de Missa is a good visit for afternoon. You can know the tradicional architecture, visit the church, two little museums and got some beatiful views.",
          "A lovely church well worth the long trek up steps nd roads to get there ,stunning views of Santa Eulalia once up there",
          "So it's a big walk up a big hill to the church, but well worth every hard fought step. Just the views from the top, across the whole bay, are worth the effort, but the church and it's grounds add the icing. Still very close to the original design, the building inspires awe and",
          "I would recommend people to visit the Puig de Missa, it has nice views of the surrounding areas and it was interesting seeing the chapel and the memorials of loved ones of the locals.",
          "Walked up the hill to the church, sweaty but well worth it. Very picturesque and serene.Also get a good look over the resort. If you like looking at churches this one is worth the walk.",
          "We set off about 9am from our hotel, we walked along the prom and then the river and up to the church. This took just over an hour at a leisurely pace, taking photos etc. The views are stunning. We looked around the unusual grave yard (with the graves being stacked on top of one",
          "Beautiful setting for wedding a shaded area just at the entrance of the church gives a welcome shade from searing afternoon sun.",
          "Attended a wedding in this small church on top of a hill. It's a beautiful little church with a small graveyard outside with wonderful views of the town. If your not fit get a taxi up. Costs about 8 euros from Santa Eulalia.",
          "I went a run along the promenade, up the river and up to this small Church which offered a little bit of History of Santa Eulalia as well as good views of the town! I would recommend this!",
          "Well worth a short stroll up from Sta Eulalia town. A simple,beautifully maintained church,with a Lovely crematorium .",
          "The church is lovely white and on a hill. You can go by foot or car. We went by car but the walk seems to be nice.The view is great on the village and the sea. The church itself inside is not that special, to my opinion.",
          "If your feeling energetic this is a nice walk, it's a bit of a climb but well worth it.The views are stunning.",
          "Start behind the Mariners Bar and walk along the river, follow the signs and find yourself going up hill, fairly steep but no need for walking shoes just comfortable footwear. Not a lot of shade so pick your time of day. About 20 - 30 minutes at a comfortable pace. Lovely views",
          "pop into tourist info centre in town and ask for a map !! no special footware needed just a good pair of trainers, take a bottle of water with you as there is a hilly walk to puig de missa",
          "Very quite peaceful church. Beautiful inside. A bit of a walk up about 100 steps from the harbour. But worth it when you get to the top. Amazing views, fabulous photos.",
          "nice walk along the river up to the church, well signposted for a round trip walk,sigs along the walk with information, at the church great views",
          "This tiny church and surrounding gardens and cemetery are a must if you have 30 mins spare. The views are also breathtaking. If you are not good with steps get a taxi to the top.",
          "Our second visit to this wonderful church and well the trek up the hill. It rewards you with a quaint and delightful building with great views",
          "Walked up here from Siesta. It was a steep enough hill to the top but was worth the effort for the view of Santa Eulalia and the lovely church. The church opens daily from 10-1 and there is mass on a Sunday morning at 10.",
          "nice if steep walk for older people to a lovely old church with great views which make the walk worthwhile,",
          "Quite a hard walk for the infirm or very young but the views are stunning once you've reached the top. The old church has a very ornate alter centre piece and is clearly cherished and kept in good order by the local community. There is a voluntary donation box on the wall inside",
          "Small church but the main town church that sits on the central hill in the town. Its well worth the climb though as its interior is as you would expect from a Spanish catholic church lots of gold leaf, it is very historic and next door just down the hill a bit is the Museum of",
          "Must visit and the cemetry. High on the hillside. A lot of gold insde.From out side you overlook the river running down into the sea.",
          "A great walk up here to see the pretty little church and museum and to admire the views over Santa Eulalia! We found the walk quite eady albeit a little steep at times and would have preferred to wear trainers to grip a bit better. Well worth the effort!",

          "Nice walk up along the river and a good climb to the church with an interesting history and scenery to match",
          "We spent the morning walking around this lovely place. The church and surrounding areas are completely unspoilt and beautiful. We spent some time walking around the burial areas and were surprised to see how modern and well tendered they were.",
          "My nieces was married in this beautiful church on 1st June. The interior of the church for such a small church was out of this world. If I had not gone for the wedding I would probably have taken a walk up to the church as it is not that far a walk from the sea front. There",
          "We have visited the Puig on most of our visits to Santa Eulalia, We prefer to walk along the river and then the path past the water mill and then via around a 100 steps to the Puig. There are nice views all around Santa Eulalia.",
          "It can be seen from anywhere in the town and well worth the walk up the steep streets there is also a museum close by",
          "train goes up there from the front but we walked up 140 steps approx. but once there it is a beautiful place to visit",
          "Staying in the Riomar, the location was ideal. This is by no means spectacular to my previous review of Dalt Vila in Evissa. But if you're bored or fancy a walk to see what the fuss is about its well worth it. If you ask at your info desk they'll give you a route guide to follow",
          "A place to visit if your in the area and its all free.Great views of the harbour and bay area from here. Very quiet and peaceful. A museum was here too but we could not visit due to a large school group being in side already.",

          "We did not stay long in Puig de Missa but walked around during a stop off whilst on a trip around the island.",

          "You can climb the Puig de Missa \u2013 the hill that rises above Santa Eulalia del R\u00edo \u2013 in about half an hour. At the top there\u2019s a whitewashed 16th-century church to look into, not to mention a pretty stunning view.",
          "Nice for a short end of the afternoon walk if you are staying in Santa Eularia. There are similar churches, for example in Santa Gertrudis, San Agnes and San Josep which are also worthwhile a visit.",
          "Earlier reviews suggested this is a huge walk. It isn't. From the sea, follow the river up to the road and follow the signs. OK it is uphill, but not too steep, and well worth the visit, not only for the views but for the quaint Spanish style of cremation booths, the small ur",
          "A great nice walk to the church,. Very romantic and lovely view from the church after going up..recommended!",

          "A nice little find, fantastic views from the church. Very peaceful, well worth a visit. The church yard is special with peacocks roaming around.",
          "A peek into how Ibiza rich people lived centuries ago. Peaceful and with lovely views. Small cemetery with many repeated family names, and lots of people who lived well over 90, probably because of said peace.",

          "We liked walking up here and went on a Sunday and saw a service being held within the church. It was lovely.",
          "Take the walk up to this peaceful church. Its all uphill and absolutely worth the effort. A local boy will open up in the mornings is you arrive early and he turns on the gentle music and lights the candles. The views from here are wonderful and it is always a high light of our",
          "Well worth the walk up the hill as the views of Santa Eulalia are amazing. The church is well worth a look",
          "Its worth a walk up there, but don't expect a fabulous church. Its fairly ordinary. I suggest that you drop down to the Roman Bridge, and walk along the river to the sea front",

          "Basically, Santa Eulalia is a very pleasant, quiet resort for families and couples. however, like the rest of Ibiza, it is lacking in the old Spanish charm you find in say Northern Mallorca, apart from maybe the small old town of Ibiza, there is no cultural interest on the",

          "A lovely walk up to this church along river or through town. Lovely views and very peaceful. We went twice whilst in Santa Eulalia.",
          "Worth the short but steep walk up to the top. The views are excellent and you can get a 360 degree view of the area. The church is pretty and well maintained and it is free unless you want to make a donation. The museum is very good and inexpensive, also worth seeing.",
          "You cannot stay in St Eulalia with visitin Puig de Missa. It is enchanting, and take time to walk around the inside and outside this little church. The detail of the altar is stunning. Look out for the shell details everywhere. And lastly make sure that you visit the very",

          "There is absolutely no doubt that this place: - offers amazing production in terms of DJs - stuns with its stage, sound and light - is bloody expensive (like all super clubs at Ibiza). The place is a must-visit one if you have never been there. The main issue, though, is that",
          "Watched David Guetta perform here as part of his BIG Monday\u2019s in Ibiza. Setting and venue was excellent. Sound was brilliant and the show probably the best in Ibiza this season. I have no issue paying 60\u20ac for the tickets. But to charge 14\u20ac for a small 330ml beer is pure greed",
          "We went here as part of my friends Hen Doo. We only went for a few hours at night, it was great, brilliant atmosphere, not overpriced like other places in Ibiza. Would definitely go back and do the full day experience.",
          "Excellent location and great value when consider club price tickets that are included with wristband. High end finish but many front office staff sorely lacking in personal skills. Cold welcome and exit. Beach restaurant had a dj which was great.",
          "The venue is amazing a lot of potential, we went for ants and all I can say as far as the music not my cup of tea would have rather gone to see dimitri or David Guetta. We got there around 6 and it was already stupid crowded tickets online cost $50 a piece and the drink pack was",
          "The yearly Garden of Madness event with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike will be the best party you will find. Especially the closing party should be on everyone\u2019s Party-Bucket-list!",
          "I know its ibiza and things are not cheap, I get that, but when all drinks bar the wine are 18 euros that's just extortionate. Yes we had an amazing time but I wojt be returning purely based on the sheer cost of the place",
          "Been here a few times. Never dissapoints. What a night. Seen Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike. Pure class. Great interaction with crowd. Great atmosphere with the top of the range laser / smoke effects and planes flying overhead every few mins. There really is nowhere like it.",
          "Wow! What an experience enjoyed from start to finish. Drinks are very pricey (17 euro for a malibu and coke) but the show very enjoyable. It is cramped at the front so we were at the back near the bar where there was more room. The toilet queues werent an issue like some places.",
          "I walked through the beach club and used their facilities (which are clean but small). The beach itself is lovely and was not too busy when we went mid September.",
          "Myself and my partner did the early bird tickets . We Arrived at 4.30 a short que to get in, security checks were thorough. By this time It wasn\u2019t too busy. However that had all changed by 6 pm there was little room to move, at 7 pm they opened the area around the main stage, it",
          "I thought I might be a bit old for this place at 50, but wanted to experience it and always enjoy a dance. I was not the oldest there and did not feel remotely out of place. The young man at our beach club in the afternoon thought we wouldn\u2019t like it, how wrong! Saw Armin Van",
          "This hotel is amazing can\u2019t wait to book again well worth the extra money \ud83d\ude09 stayed in the anything can happen suit it has everything you need but you do have to pay \ud83d\ude44",
          "I went here Saturday night for Ants with a group of friends. Agree with the other reviews, you are herded around like animals by the staff. Queues for toilets were around an hour and people pushing past to jump the queue. Never experienced so much arrogance in all my life.",
          "I was at the Calvin harris closing party, there were not enough security, other than in VIP I struggled to see any. Drinks/glasses were being thrown, people being aggressive, pushing and shoving, people on shoulders blocking view and over packed with no space to dance, I got",
          "Dubious about going after 4 days of late nights but we had paid 60 euro so went for it. So glad we did. Well organised with plenty of space to hang out. This is more of a concert venue than a club that operates at dusk until 11am. The artists were sensational with and amazing",
          "Second year visiting Ants! The music and the crowd at this night are awesome. Last year we also tried the Tommorowland evening, but found the Ants night much much better. Ants all the way for us now. The only thing I dont like about this place is that is closes so early!",
          "Dimitri Vegas/Like Mike disappointing! Highlight was Jonas Blue, Teamworx & Vito Mendez. Overcrowded!",
          "Went for Calvin Harris and Disciples. Overall had a good time, great venue, but massively overcrowded. Drinks are insanely overpriced even by ibiza standards. As for the music, got there around 5 and the music was great. Disciples were a definite highlight. Unfortunately, Calvin",
          "Best party place ever. Amazing vibes, different parties everyday to fit the style of everyone. Only bad thing are the bouncers they are very aggressive and rude with no reason.",
          "Great party, very good music and sound, happy dancing party people everywhere, the whole Arena is the dancefloor, like on a festival. There is also a 30cm deep swimming/dancing/pool where you can dance and cool down at the same time. The prices for drings are't from this",
          "I had an amazing experience! saw Calvin Harris the first weekend of August and paid 60Euros. Then, on Saturday we came back again! best party ever!! worth every euro and loved it so much! you better dress light as there are lots of people and also, wear sneakers, no sandals!",
          "We visited last time for David Guetta so this time was Martin Garrix. What a show, really well organised with lovely staff. Remember to take ID no matter your age and be prepared for over priced drinks as in any \"club\". Had an amazing time!",
          "Attended here Saturday for Ants. We arrived there for 6pm, bought the token deal which was 85 euros for 6 drinks. The venue was very busy. The main stage wasn\u2019t open as it doesn\u2019t open until 7ish. Got to the bar which was inside under cover with zero air con. Waited 20 minutes",
          "Great venue and line ups. Amazing atmosphere. Unfortunately this year they started closing at 11pm and the party doesn\u2019t properly start going until 8pm or later so it is very short. I always have fun but then it feels like your night is cut short half way through! Also at",
          "Our second visit to Ushuaia , Calvin Harris was on enjoyable evening but drinks are way too overpriced (4 vodka & coke \u20ac97)outrageous!!! How can you charge this price? Very crowded too staff rude just pushing you to move out way instead of excuse me, no manners! Good venue for",
          "The best daytime party you will see in ibiza. The price might be little high (just like any other party in Ibiza) but worth it. Check their schedule bc famous djs always play there",
          "We went several times to the Ushuaia Beach Club - but only for drinks because our son urgently wanted to see the performing DJ Martin Garrix every Thursday. Eva - a very nice, competent and childfriendly waitress took perfectly care of us, She served my girlfriend and me cool",
          "We attended a Martin Garrix gig here. It was by far the best gig of it's kind we had been to in Ibiza purely because of the venue. Alcohol is very expensive because they only serve premium spirits - 2 Belvedere Vodkas with red bull was \u20ac36. However you know this is the case when",
          "Went to Calvin Harris last week- a group of 8 girls. One was not drinking alcohol as she was catching a flight back to london after the event. Her drink was spiked by some boys she spoke to briefly. I found her throwing up in the bathroom and soon we were unable to rouse her. As",
          "What an amazing night , we went to see David Guetta it was awesome tune after time interacted with us all, it was one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had , met some amazing people and danced from the minute we got in until the minute we left . It\u2019s very well run but wow the",
          "Me and my friends attended Ushuaia and there was DJ David Guetta. Year after year I`m impressed. Atmosphere is top, amazing music. A must visit",
          "Calvin Harris! Wow! What a show went down over here! The location of this hotel, felt like I was more in an amusement park, which is perfect for this type of event! The stage set up and light effects were out of this world. The music was amazing!! We loved it every minute!",
          "I arrived early and watched the first two sets which was really good and not cramped in the slightest. We then moved over to the right hand side of the stage to watch Jonas Blue who was brilliant, however at this point it has started to get busy! I am 24 and I have Instagram",
          "Ushuaia as a venue is absolutely great and looks amazing, sound was fab. Went for Calvin Harris but they he let too many people in and it was heaving, getting to the bar was a nightmare! However, it is one of those places you just have to visit, and you'll have an amazing time",
          "Visually it's a great venue however it was extremely over crowded!! Calvin Harris was great and got the crowd going but it's very difficult to enjoy yourself when getting elbowed and aggressively pushed left to right consistently throughout the night. Real shame - will not be",
          "Second visit to Ushuaia as did David Guetta BIG last year and loved it. Going later in the season proved a very different experience for us, it was VERY congested a lot of shoving and a lot of rude individuals (mainly very tall men - I'm 5ft 2) pretending to walk past you, then",
          "We stayed at Ushuaia during our 4 night trip to Ibiza. It was so convenient to stay here, the bracelet allowed us access to the day party and club HI at night. We could walk to most places on this side of the island and were in the happening part of town. The pool side was",
          "Fun and colourful but far too busy, quite a rough crowd. Disappointed that Eats Everything played an early set even though on flyer as one of the headliners. Annoying Elrow entertainer on balcony level playing musical chairs with punters and playing music so couldn\u2019t hear music",
          "We came to Martin garrix on Thursday. Great event, the club is very nice but gets very busy. Drinks are around 16 euros each which is about average for playa den bossa. We recommend to stay to the left side of the stage if you want to leave quickly as this is the only exit.",
          "Perfect stay. The service is extremely friendly and fast, people around oneself are very nice and the food is supertasty. Also try the massage, it\u2019s great!",
          "Let's go for Martin Garrix Calvin Harris and David guetta It will be an onforgetableline up We had an top experience in June 2016 and July 2018 Its a must for edm fans Ans service is more than ok",
          "Entry to get in was really quick, loved the vibe of this place (for the guys shorts are more than fine). The downside is that there are 2 big bars towards the front that block out a lot of the view of the main stage and the bar queues are the back are crazy long (around 45",
          "Wow! What an amazing place. Drinks are very very very pricey but it\u2019s such an amazing place it\u2019s worth it!",
          "Second time here to party! Saw David Guetta Go around 7 it\u2019s best as it\u2019s super hot if you are there earlier and vibe isn\u2019t great yet! Stand close to the pool so you can see the girls dancing and have some air when it gets packed! Super cool party must go",
          "Went to see DJ Diesel, lost frequencies and Dimitri Vegas and like Mike. Very very cool. The venue was so spacious. So many people yet so spacious. Never had to queue for the toilet or a drink (don\u2019t do it SO EXPENSIVE) there is a pool but you aren\u2019t allowed in it. The set up of",

          "Went to Ushuaia on thursday 4th july with Garrix's show and other good djs. Fabulous athmosphere, light, music, sound. People too crowded, you have to stand up from the beginning to the end of the show. Drinks too expensive Good security checks A fun experience",
          "Amazing venue but everything is extremely overpriced and staff wasn\u2019t very friendly. Charged different prices for the same drink throughout the night.",
          "We attended the David Guetta gig here in June. Atmosphere was great but drink prices were through the roof. Bought 2 sickly sweet cocktails which were undrinkable for \u20ac18 each. Water was \u20ac11 a bottle. Place was lovely and clean including toilets at least! Great venue but please",

          "You can have better options in Ibiza. Party hotel is a very nice hotel only because of the people coming to the hotel from outside. The rooms are clean but Rooms are very hot , The managers are very friendly and courteous BUT the staff are very slow and lousy and it takes them",
          "This hotel is so clean and friendly! The food is even better and Emilio made me such a great drink. The club here is the best in Ibiza and Nerea was so great at the restaurant! I highly recommend this place and would say this is the best pick.",

          "Would have given the place 0 stars Drug dealers in your face before and after the show. Strict security on entry. fine no problems and we were through quickly. The early arrivals are kept around the small dj booth. Other than the music nothing going on. No dancers and even whe",
          "First of all, the place is amazing, really good for a daytime party and every time it feels like a festival, BUT for all the times I have visited Ushuaia, I never felt as angry and as disappointed as yesterday. I always go for the music and as a worker I always make the",

          "Went for the closing party and was very disappointed. The upper terrace was closed and back section of the venue had a area dedicated to market stalls. No effort seemed to have been put into the night with no light show or performers. Take my advice and give Dystopia a miss.",

          "Best club I\u2019ve ever been to, the atmosphere was incredible. The only thing letting this place down is the unbelievable drinks prices! My boyfriend paid \u20ac33 for a double vodka and coke. Soft drinks were 10\u20ac and i think single and mixer was \u20ac19. Would recommend but be prepared",

          "Loved this event! The lights and lasers are always so good. The sound system is insane and really captivates you. We went in September so it wasn\u2019t as busy as it usually is, which was nice. The drink prices have gone up this year which is annoying as you pay so much on entry. A",

          "The venue overall is amazing! The music and performances are also to a very high standard. The staff aren\u2019t the greatest, not all of them are terrible but the service considering the price you pay should be a lot higher than what it is. Had a good time but will probably attend",

          "One of the best clubs I\u2019ve visited in Ibiza! I saw tinie tempah, krept and konan and mostack and some others here. I had never visited before but the security staff were fair with the searches and the toilets always clean and the ladies in the toilets professional always keeping",
          "First time here so didn\u2019t know what to expect from a sound quality point of view and it being an outdoor venue. Needn\u2019t have worried as the sound quality was absolutely amazing. View was good pretty much wherever you stood (although I am 6\u20193) and getting in was easy despite long",
          "Two years ago we saw Avicii and never thought anything would come close to being as good. However, David Guetta was truly fantastic.

          "Ridiculously priced! \u20ac11 for water! Considering it\u2019s a hot climate and water is a necessity you would expect it to be a reasonable price. I would expect to get a small bank loan if you want a reasonable amount of drink. The music was very similar each track. Not a great",

          "If you want to experience an Ibiza night out but aren\u2019t a mental party animal then a night at Ushuaia is for you. There are plenty of bars and places to eat nearby so you can get tanked up for cheap before you enter one of the most expensive clubs in the world. I think we paid",
          "This open air venue is probably the best club in the world due to the top notch dj, sound systems and the space itself",
          "Went to see Big by David Guetta and it was incredible. Atmosphere was fantastic and we were able to get 3 people from the front with a perfect view. Drinks are \u20ac20 a go but we only got one each then danced the night away \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",

          "What can be said about one of the most popular clubs in Ibiza that hasn't already been said. The advice I would give is ensure you choose the correct music type you are into, if you are a drinker the drinks aren't cheap however that is the nature of the beast. If you want to",
          "The worst party venue ever. Any respectable party place has free water fountains. There\u2019s no place to sit. Drinks are very expensive the entry fee as well. Staff is rude and the grounds are dirty ando so are the sad plastic glasses they serve drinks in. The guy collecting the",

          "We came here to see David Guetta BIG. Drinks were a complete rip off. We got the mojitos however both times they didn't pour the standard 30ml of booze. They just kept adding sprite and ice to the drink to fill it up. Considering we paid \u20ac18 for one drink, I expect the standard",

          "You do not have to be a hotel guest to access the gigs, which are always a great experience. It can get VERY crowded so be prepared to make like a sardine. The atmosphere and surroundings are fantastic. Staff are lovely. A must do if you're on a partying holiday.",

          "The Ushuaia is as unique a hotel experience as I've ever been to. As much a club as a hotel, it's 5star accommodation and 5star music. Situated right on the beach, which is reasonably private for all guests, and with 4 pools too. The Saturday night turned into a 7,000 guest",

But a vodka and red bull was \u20ac19, you were not allowed to buy two vodkas to go with one red bull either.",
          "this was the place that everyone spoke highly of, unfortunately our experience didn't match that. We arrived celebrating our friend's stag and we were faced by very offensive and extremely rude staff. The service was very poor. I travel around the world (more than 80 countries)",

We got to the port and the shop was closed and no representatives were in site.\nAll other ferry companies were or either operating or had personal to refund ferry tickets. \nCheap can be expansive. We end up buying a ticket from another company.",
          "Took a ferry from Santa Eulalia to Es Cana resort. The ferry was clean and the crew very helpful. The timetable was accurate and no waiting around to get on or off the ferry. Reasonably priced too",
          "Reasonably priced - but the boat was very small and couldn't really cope with the choppy sea. We were thrown about quite a bit. The ceiling even leaked a little. But was still fun (for me - not so much others)\nAfter being in the sun all \u2026",

We were all laughing away getting splashed at the front of the boat. It says 40mins but it took more like an hour on the way out, 50mins on the way back.",

You can look on youre map. Really crazy woman who work there she doesnt want to tell me. Really arrogant. Never go here!",
          "The services were relatively punctual and it saved me some travel expenses. Recommended!",

They overbook the boat and force half of the people that have been waiting in line for 20+ min to \u2018change\u2019 their ticket in the aquabus booth in which there is noone. After asking three times and getting angry responses we gave up and went for another ferry. Ridiculous.",

          "The ticket sellers told us that the ferry would take 40 minutes to get to Formentera. That is simply not true. Both trips took 55 minutes.\n\nThey have smaller and older boats and try to compete with Balearia and others in price but they \u2026",

        "wiki": "Cala Benirr\u00e1s is a beach in the northern seaboard of the Spanish island of Ibiza. It is in the municipality of Sant Joan de Labritja and is 4.6 miles (7.4 km) east of the village of Sant Joan de Labritja and 4.6 miles (7.4 km) north north east of the village of Sant Miquel de Balansat.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis beach of this cove, called Port de Benirr\u00e1s by the local fishermen, is about 300 metres long and is set against a backdrop of densely pine forested cliffs.  The beach is a mixture of pebbles and sand with rocks at either end of the beach. The bay's crystal clear sea makes the cove a popular spot for snorkelling but caution is required due to the amount of marine traffic in the bay. The rocks to the side have several dry-dock fisherman\u2019s shacks. The sheltered bay is an anchoring spot for private yachts and motor boats. There are many paths for walkers leading from the beach through the surrounding woodlands. Offshore in the middle of the bay lies a rock called Cap Bernat. The rock is said to resemble, variously, a woman at prayer, a giant baby, or the Sphinx.\n\n\n== Day of The Drums ==\nIbiza was a destinations for hippies in the 1960s. In that time, it became the scene of sporadic full moon-parties. This declined in the 1980s, but became popular again in the 1990s.On Sunday August 18, 1991 a gathering of anti-war activists, Hippies and other sympathisers, took place on the beach at Benirr\u00e1s. This event is now known as The Day of the Drums. The gathering was in protest at the first Gulf War in Iraq. The protest later evolved into an annual event, much to the concerns of the authorities and emergency services. Bylaws restricted the event until it was banned it altogether in 2002.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

Apart from urban areas and public baths (some of which offer nude swimming days), nude bathing is common in Germany: unofficial clothing optional areas exist at most lakes and rivers and other sites, such as abandoned sand and rock quarries. Many designated Freik\u00f6rperkultur (FKK \u2013 Free Body Culture) areas exist at the seaside, at lakes and in baths, especially in the former East Germany, where nudism remains more widespread than in the west. Many unregulated clothing optional (FKK) free beaches are available along the Nordsee and Baltic seashores, R\u00fcgen and other islands. The attitude is: all beaches are nude beaches until somebody complains.

        "wiki": "Cala d'Albarca is a cove on the northern seaboard of the Spanish island of Ibiza. The cove is situated within the municipality Sant Antoni de Portmany. It is 4.0 miles (6.4 km)  north east of the village of Santa Agn\u00e8s de Corona and 14.0 miles (22.5 km) north of Ibiza Town.\n\n\n== Description ==\nOnly the most determined explorer will be able to access the secluded bay. The cove in a large horseshoe with a rocky peninsular either side. To the eastern end is Cap des Rubi\u00f3 while at the western end is Cap d'Albarca  both of which are over 200 metres (660 ft) above sea level. To south of d'Albarca  is the hills of Puig d'en Cires and Puig de sa Cova\u2019, 295 metres (968 ft) and 340 metres (1,120 ft) above sea level, respectively. Down in the cove there is a rocky beach, but no sand, but the impressive coastline here is scattered with huge boulders. One very impressive feature is a cracked natural arch. There are many flat rocks and ledges close to the waters edge which are good sunbathing spots. The water in the bay is crystal clear and is a deep turquoise when the sun shines. This is the ideal bay for snorkelling and diving.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "One of the most beautiful beaches we visited in Ibiza. Put your towel on one of the giant rocks around the beach, enjoy the view or take a dip in the crystal clear water. Loved how they were serving cocktails to the people sunbathing on the rocks. I guess it could get a bit",
          "Went hear after seeing the videos on Jon Olsson's Vlog and have to say that it looks even better than it does in the pictures! May not be the best to go with children as some rock climbing is involved to see the view from the top but aside from that it's breathtakingly",

          "This must be the clearest, calmest water I've ever been in. The beach is sandy and although it's small, there is a lovely cafe/restaurant so you can buy food or drink. Be prepared for a bit of a trek from the car park - but it's worth it.",
          "Beautiful clear waters, we went to Cala Gracio and Cala Bassa but this one beats them all. It was a long hike but was worth it. I recommend you go from 1pm to 6pm or after. Then run down to the cafe to order a taxi home. Taxi to Cala Salada from San Antoni port took around 26",
          "Rocky beaches and stony cliff sides allow for cliff diving and perching for a perfect tanning experience! So relaxing! Pristine waters glisten while docked sailboats gently undulate! Taxi ride from Ibiza town around $30 - worth to see what Ibiza really has to offer for",
          "If you want a pebble beach with hardly any sand and a huge rock to climb to get to the good bit then go for it. Not a good experience with a young family. Disappointed.",
          "Fabulous authentic Spanish beach restaurant, great fish , great service, great atmosphere , this little beach restaurant is well worth walking down all the steps and after a few drinks you float back up !",
          "Probably my favourite beach in Ibiza. To get to the best sandy part you have to climb over some rocks but well worth it when you get there. Water is so clear and the view is amazing. There is parking nearby. Although a bit of a walk from the beach.",
          "Went here on a day trip on my second week in Ibiza. This beach is great for walking, sun bathing and swimming. The beach also has a great catering service as there is a cafe just up hill from there. They also offer light snacks and refreshments.",
          "We loved this beach, so glad we managed to find it. The view is just beautiful. Finding a cab back was a bit difficult. Would advise taking a car.",
          "Friendly staff, lunch was very good. Would visit again. Need a car to get there. Beautiful views. A little more expensive but worth the trip.",
          "The walk is long until you get there but you definitely have to go!!!We park out car lucky close by and we walk all the way trough!",
          "This is a really lovely place to visit. Never seen such Turquoise sea !!! Lovely boat ride from San Antonio Bay. Then walk over the rocks. Views are fantastic !!!",
          "Excellent place to spend a few hours. Rock jumping into the turquoise water was the perfect hangover cure. Varying heights for rock jumping. Just be warned the return to land can be tricky once you jump in if you are a weak swimmer.",
          "Beautiful beach - quite out the way which is nice. There were people making and selling fresh fruity mojitos that were the best I've ever tasted! No blaring music and so chilled out! Definitely recommend",
          "Amazing place but go early otherwise the parking will get full and you will have to walk 30 minutes to reach this magic beach. Careful the restaurant over there is not good at all and very expensive,",
          "If u go up to the rocks you reach playa saladeta amazing water amazing drinks and food sold by some really cool guys!",
          "A bit difficult to access it. Needs a ride and than walk so wear comfortable shoes. Beach was very beautiful with lovely sand and waters. However it is small and with too many people so would not go again. You can't enjoy it fully.",
          "not very nice.is cheaper by boat to go to cala conta which is the best experience ever. but take a snorkel.",
          "With so many fantastic beaches on or around Ibiza (in particular Playa d'en Bossa and on Formentera) I just can't understand all the positive reviews of this place. The beach is small, horribly crowded and too pebbly to make walking or bathing comfortable. There's a few run",
          "Very beutiful beach!!!! The way to the beach is adventure, not for granys/ childern/ disable people. After arrive the beach enjoy the sandy and the sea.",
          "There are 2 beaches, cala salada and saladita. There are lots of rocks on cala salada and I don't like it at all but if you takethe small path through the hills after 5-10 minutes you will get to cala saladita what is a wonderful beach however is very busy and all the fushes",
          "Beautiful beach and setting, but if you get there after 10am in September when we went you have to park a 25 minute walk away and the walk back is even longer as its up hill. Its very busy as its so popular, so if you are looking for a quiet beach it might not be worth a visit.",
          "It's a beautiful beach with spectacular views. I do recommend you get there early to get a park closer to the beach. There is a parking and bus ride that we saw seemed to be quite efficient.",
          "Amazing experience with Ruben, very knowledgeable and wants to make it a fun experience for all....great snorkelling too and lovely refreshing melon and cold drinks on the way back.",
          "We were there early which is why we had a place to park. In the afternoon we took some extra people in the car because its quite a hike if your car is on the top of the hill. Beds are priced at 21 euros for two which seems to be the going rate. Had lunch at the one restaurant.",
          "This is one of my fav beach in Eivissa Island. Easy access, boat, car, or walk if you enjoy hiking the beautiful coastal path.",
          "I live Cala salada, is one of the best on the island. Unluckily who live here, like me can't go there during July-August. Too many people and the beach is not that big.",
          "Lovely beech great boat trip to it lots or restaurants there can spend a day there just lovely We really enjoyed ourselfs it was really busy great for kids to.",
          "You can get to Cala Salada by car, although it has limited parking spaces and you may have to wait a while. I'd recommend taking the bus from the free parking lot on the road, which goes by every 20 min or less. The beach was beautiful but crowded. There is a chiringuito where",
          "Like all ibiza sea side are really nice and you can take a rest not too busy really nice place to stay !",
          "The beach is in a little nice and quiet cove, perfect if you want to just enjoy the sounds of nature. The shore is rocky and the waters are cool and so refreshing. Though small, this beach offers plenty of amenities. There are chairs and umbrellas for rent (21\u20ac for two chairs",
          "One of the truly awesome beaches on the island of ibiza it is well worth the trip and a great day at the beach",
          "Went here in July on a Saturday and it was pretty busy - mainly locals. There are not many sunbeds but the sand is pretty good. You can buy cocktails from a few makeshift stalls on the beach.",
          "Loved it. Amazing staff, amazing food. Went three times in one week!! Really would recommend this place it is beautiful. Highlight of my holiday.",
          "One of the many beaches we visited on our stay and possibly our favourite. Beautiful views and crystal clear water. There were some locals selling cocktails and traditional food which were appreciated and tasty. Make sure you take an umbrella for shade in summer",
          "You used to able to park here, now the council have introduced a park and ride so no cars within 3 km of the beach! absolute disaster!!! Have to carry everything there and everything back up a steep hill! There are no allowances made for dropping off supplies, small children or",
          "Awesome place, crystal clear water, white beaches, plenty of fish, great for snorkeling and sun bathing! Only downside is the path to reach the beach which is a dirt path in the middle of the brush",
          "I don't recommend playa cala salada, it's mostly just rocks and cliffs and barely any sand. You're better off visiting other beaches.",
          "Lovely quiet beach, beautiful water..but lots of rocks around. I got 4 stings from sea urchins (wasn't being careful near the rocks!) Would strongly suggest having some sort of swimming footwear.",
          "Been to this beach many many times, it is so beautiful and the sea is crystal clear! It is quite a walk over the steep cliffs to get to but it's worth it. There is always a guy selling cheap fresh mojitos which just adds to its charm. Lots of different size cliffs to jump off",
          "The water at this beach is very nice. Crystal clear and great for snorkling. But there are a lot of rocks - not a sandy beach. So that's why it would be easier to bring some shoes to go into the water. THe chairs were quiet expensive to rent (22 euros for 2 chairs). A lot of",
          "This beach is stunning and a bit more secluded. It's easy to get a spot to sunbathe and the water is sparkly and bright blue. A must visit. Pack your sun cream and beach towels!",
          "This beach felt secluded and somehow more intimate than many of the places we have visited. Perfect for watching the sunset.",
          "A lovely little bay off the beaten track. We got here by boat. Well worth a visit. Quiet and not so many tourists, very shallow and clear waters.",
          "A must visit location. Whether you want to cliff jump or hang by the shore, Cala Salada is perfect for you. It's quite beautiful and out of the way of tourists. Take the bus or a 9\u20ac taxi from San Antoni. You won't regret it",
          "Got the bus-boat from San Antonio. Good trip and a great couple of little beaches in a lovely bay. Caf\u00e9 and restaurant nestled in the corner, where you can get anything from beer and crisps, to paninis and full course meals. Really lovely here! Worth a visit",
          "This beach was stunning! One of my favourite beaches in Europe. Took a taxi from San Antonio and totally worth it. Not too busy like some beaches in Ibiza. Cocktail bar on the beach, good music playing and locals walking around selling amazing food! Would strongly recommend",
          "great views, clean water, many locals going there, took us 20minutes to get there from san antoni, i would reccommend it especially to couples and families",
          "The beach is very rocky so you need to rent a bed, which is not exactly cheap. Most people go to the cala saladeta, which is a bit difficult to reach as you have to walk on the rocks. Super views, definitely the nicest beach around! !!",
          "Really lovely beach, beautiful blue clear sea, The Bay Area has amazing views. The sea was clear, child friendly. Friendly helpful restaurant, good food, paella was delicious. Various boat activities on offer.",
          "This wasn't the first time I've been there- but I spotted that it is much better going during the week than for the weekend ( just in case you want to have a place you can put your stuff). But it is amazingly quiet and calming. After this you are feeling like a new person.",
          "It's good to feel a bit isolated from the crazyness of the island's cities. A bit of a more cala style beach which can be crowded though. We settled on some flat rocks and a guy came and offered to serve mojitos... Ok, I took 1L for 15\u20ac\ud83d\ude2c. Water's clean, pines and sun, what we",
          "Amazing views and atmosphere, but it is a 5 min walk over the hill to get to the sand part of the beach, so it might be suited for kids, and also the are no facilities like toilets and showers there",
          "Being in Ibiza going to Cala Salada it's a MUST.It's one of the best beaches with white sand and clear waters;it's so amazing I've been there 3days in a row....AMAZING!!!!",
          "It is nice small beach near San Antonio. Very low key and crystal clear water. The beach gets very busy, so go there early with your car to make sure there is parking space available. Otherwise you must park up on the hill and walk ~1km way down to the beach (uphill when you",
          "Very close to San Antonio yet a million miles apart. We went here on our last day of our trip. The beach was pretty quiet which was lovely for relaxing. The water is clear and not cold but it warm, took a bit of adjusting. We went to the beach on the left, which is made up",
          "Saw many beaches in Ibiza, this is definitely my favourite! Few families and kids, just groups of friends from 30 to 50. Enjoy a drink at the little kiosk on the shore and swim in the amazing crystal water",
          "Definitely visit Cala Salada! This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been too. The scenery is unreal and the water is so clear. Just beware that getting a taxi from this beach is very difficult/ almost impossible. When we tried to call a taxi from the restaurant",
          "Beautiful little cala, clear water, great sandy beach, enclose in a natural park, with a restaurant and a chiringuito, what else can I ask for?",
          "Reccommended by: Ariadna the argentinian We are thankful to Ariadna for letting us know about this place! Excellent view! People have to visit the place! Very clean beach, clear blue water, perfect for leisure! Although, is very quite place is the best place in Ibiza!!",
          "We were recommend to come here and it did not disappoint. Beautiful views, and such a quiet, tranquil place.",
          "To me so far, besides Bassa, this is one of the most beautiful spots on the island. Clear water, nice beach between the woods. Let's hope it stays undiscovered...",
          "Yes Fantastic but it gets very busy even in September. This is one of the nicest beaches in Ibiza and kept very clean.",
          "Nice beach and perfect color of the sea but it's not easy to get it, we almost climbed to reach this beach. Wear comfort flips!",
          "If you were planning on staying in San Antonio. Plan on going to the beach. The Cliff views and the topless women are worth it",
          "A truly truly awesome beach and a stunning place to catch some Sun, would go back any time and survey a true taste of Ibiza",
          "Crystal clear waters and sweet little restaurant, perfect for sangria and a fish lunch. The rocky area in the middle is great for sunbathing, though not easily accessible for those with mobility problems.",
          "Whenever we return to the Island we always make a point of visiting this beach. We love the fact that not much changes. The family run restaurant serves the best mussels in the area. And a lovely place to watch the sun go down.",
          "This beach is amazing and it is not so far from San Antonio and it wasn't crowded (we were there in June). There is a restaurant and drinks are not cheap but ok. They did serve food but we had brought our lunch with us so just needed the cold drinks.",
          "You have to visit this beach while spending time in ibiza it's one of the most beautiful beaches there",
          "If you like to be around young people and avoid the typical sun beds and umbrellas, it's worth the hike to the 2nd beach. Harder access but wilder.",
          "Me and my sister were recommended this beach by a friend who had been doing a season in Ibiza. Were advised we couldnt walk and would have to get a taxi. The road leading there is a little scary (narrow and crumbling away in parts). We were dropped off and had to clamber over",
          "Quiet cove in two parts. Kids loved jumping off the rocks into the sea. Walk along the cliff top 100m to get to the sandy beach. Car essential.",
          "Lovely little cove unfortunately couldnt swim because it was full of jelly fish lovely little bar on beach",
          "Very nice beach if you can manage the rock climbing to the beach. Not for young children! Also an open nudist beach if you like that stuff. Small cafe of the shingle side of the cliff which very pleasant, you can hire a pedelo from that side also. Drink is as per rest of the",
          "We dropped down into Cala Salada just about spot on 2pm, so headed straight for the only restaurant located on the beach (or anywhere near!). Firstly, we were gesticulated at, as we'd taken their menus onto a lower section of the restaurant that was only for the bar... so now",
          "Went by taxi only \u20ac12 from san antonio bay. You can also get a ferry boat for \u20ac9. As my partner cannot swim we had to trek over a small hill path but no big deal as the jewel of the bay beach is astounding. Small but secluded and theres a friendly rasta man selling cold drinks",
          "Need a car to get there, the next beach Saladeta is better. Cala Salada however has a bar/ restaurant and toilets, also can hire a long chair and a parasol.",
          "Everybody said, \"go to Cala Salada because is beautiful\"..... Ok, the view when we access from the parking is nice but the Cala Salada beach is all stones and it is very dirty.. The only nice thing is the boat \"garages\" located in the left side if the beach... very nice and with",
          "Stunning little bay. Not worth the treacherous route to the beach. Hire a sun lounger,chill out and relax. Little restaurant is lovely. Get there early as later in the day gets very busy with locals and tourists.",
          "This is a lovely bay which used to have sand deposited regularly however this has now ceased and the relentless tides has laid bare the rocks so where beach shoes. Excellant restuarant which has been in the same family for generations serves excellent paella, one of the best on",
          "The sea and the beach on the right hand side is good but a bit dirty. It is quite crowded but the good thing is that, you can find food and drink at the back of the beach. However, it is not possible to go back with a taxi. The taxi is coming from San Antonio and they do not",
          "One of the best beaches in Ibiza. The best months to visit it is May, June and September. It\u00b4s impossible to get parking during high season (July and August). There is a good restaurant in the first part of the beach.",
          "This beach is not far from san antonio,we had a hire car so thought we would check it out,allsorts of people here,couples,families etc...,lovely beach,very clean,nice for a swim.",
          "Cala salada is a typical Ibizan beach hidden at the bottom of a wooded walk. It's a part sand part small pebble beach and does get really busy, there is a lovely bar restaurant set up off the beach at the back which does resonably priced beers and food. Cala salada has clear",
          "Typical of so many Ibizan beaches, it has it's own character and unique qualities. Can get very busy so would advise anyone wanting to experience this beach to go early or later in the day.",
          "It is not very big, it is not accessible by public transport but it is beautiful. there is also a cafeteria if you want something to drink or eat or go to the bathrooms. Lifeguards are available too.",
          "Probably one f the cleanest prettiest beaches I have ever been too. the photos really don't do it any justice. and the water was above the average of the island having no waves in the cove. the only advise I would give is get there early. Very early. if your planning on going",
          "Who could contemplate this piece of paradise lies just a short walk some of the grimiest parts of Sant Antoni .Here it is all you need for a perfect beach experience; No Cost if you walk or ride.Crystal blue , warm, heavy water is refreshing and attracts more locals than",
          "This is the most wonderful beach we visited. There is a hidden even nicer beach behind the rocks which you can reach climbing the rocks or walking the path over the hills. Definitely visit this one (by car).",
          "This lovely little beach was absolutely stunning. We had a hire car so we drove down the long, winding hill to get there just north of San An. When you park there (for free) the short walk to the beach is ok, and you arrive at Cala Salada beach. A small, pebbly beach with basic",
          "Perfect sunny beach, isolated with clear water. We went more then 10 times and every time we enjoyed it.",
          "A beautiful place for beautiful, young, childless, carefree sun worshippers. (I'm only bitter) felt like we'd gatecrashed someone's beach party! It's a bit of a climb, the beach was full, you couldn't see the sand & it doesn't have any facilities unless you want a hand made",
          "We came here via taxi and its off the beaten track in the middle of nowhere so make sure you have transport home. To get to the actual sandy beach itself there is a lot of rocky hills and turrain to climb which was ok but make sure you are up for doing it. We got to the other",
          "Went by boat from san antonio docking was poor as it was on a rock we then got off the boat and had to climb rocks to get to the beaches awful so dangerous if you enjoy rock climbing or cliff diving then you'll be fine",
          "a favorite beach near San Antonio, Ibiza, both with the locals and turists, You need a motorbike, car or other transport to get there, as busses run seldom, an it's about a 4 km hike UPHILLL from San An! I have been visiting this beach since my first time on the Island in",
          "First thing in the morning this was paradise. Hire a cycle, rise early and see the early sunlight. Loved it.",
          "Beautiful Beach, great for snorkelling. Very busy after 11am, so get there early! Not many refreshments available on the beach, nor bars etc.",
          "This beach has the clearest water I have ever seen and perfect for swimming. Jumping off of the rocks is very fun.",
          "Compared to smaller Cala Saladeta this is disappointing one, it is gavel beach with lot of sea weed and rocks in it. The only good thing about this beach is that it is close to the road and it has near by parking so you can arrive here by car or by taxi. Taxi ride from Sant",
          "A crowded pebble beach with parking a nightmare. I cannot see what all the fuss is about. Looks to be a good anchorage for visiting yachts.",
          "I have been to Ibiza 6 times to date and we usually take a trip each time to visit some of the islands more remote beaches. This is by far my favorite. Cala Salada beach is truly amazing with its white sanded beach, crystal clear water and beautiful cliffs that you can climb and",
          "Excellent spot. Very busy though so go very early for a good parking spot or go late on like us as less people and cars!",
          "This beach is stunning very dangerous to get to. either climb a cliff or a very hot walk alone a rocking path",
          "Crystal Clear Water, excellent for snorkeling. Get there early doors for best spot on the beach. Nice litte cafe next to the beach with full menu.",
          "Possibly one of the nicest beach I've ever visited. Reached it by boat taxi from San Antonio costing just \u20ac15, it was broken into two clear areas the Sand area which was reached by climbing some rocks and the stoney area. Both were beautiful but the clear blue sea water and",
          "Cala Salada beach a pretty little hideaway reached by climbing over some rocks, but getting there is well worth it because the sand and water surrounded by the rocks is very pretty, and within approximately 4 minutes of finding a spot you'll have a pretty Ibizan man approach you",
          "Love this beach, nice chiringuitos and very nice people. Not too far from Ibiza and great for sunsets. The restaurants along this beach serve very good food",
          "This cove is probably my favorite in Ibiza. When you arrive you will access a stone beach which is Cala Salada that is very nice. If your up for a little hike with beautiful views you can access a smaller sandy beach which is called Cala Saladeta. It is located on the right side",
          "it's perfect place to snorkeling,water jumping from rocks and sunbathing.no shade.difficult to reach if traveling with young kids.diffucult to reach last 200meters walk over rocks.there are privat people selling cocktails&empanadas also cloths.easy to find indication but",
          "We took the boat over to Cala conta, passed Cala bassa and was meant to go back the next day. Once at Cala conta we went up to the beach bar called sunset ashram, we got ourselves a drink then went down onto the beach. Took a while to find a spot but once we did we set up for",
          "If you want a nice relaxing break away from noisey British tourists, Cala Salada is for you. A beautiful cove, the water is clear and the sand is perfect.",
          "Me and my friends got a water taxi from San Antonio to this beach. It cost 15 Euros and was well worth the money. Crystal clear blue water and a lovely restaurant at one end where we had breakfast before hitting the sand. No good for disabled people or buggies as there is a rock",
          "This place was beautiful! Small and only a small area with sand, but the water was stunning and blue, restaurant near by, but will have to force your way inot a spot, so cant be shy. If it had more sand it would be better, but well worth the drive north of San Antonio bay!",
          "The West of ibiza has the best scenery on the island and this cove is just unbelievable. Get a taxi from San Antonio for 10 euros and this beach will make your day. The contrast between the cliffs,hills,greenery,white sugar sand and clear waters is jaw dropping. Try Cala Comte",
          "Nice little beach blue clear water there are beautiful views I recommend if you are staying in sant Antony it is near there.",
          "This beach is a short drive from San Antonio, surrounded by cliffs. It's a lovely beach to spend the day there. There is a restaurant there too and plenty of free car parking!",
          "A bit tricky to get to, you have to pass some rocks and stairs but definitely worth a visit. Fantastic views, smell of pine trees, clear water!",
          "The beach has spectacular views, also small cliffs one can dive from. Do not hesitate to visit it if you are a fan of topless sunbathing! The place itself is quite small, so make sure you go there early to preserve space",
          "Too much people with their own music, playing beach tennis.. It is probably the most beautiful beach of the island and it is really sad to have music from a near group on the beach, music from a boat, sky jets, ..",
          "This cala is very easy to find probably that's why is popular as well. We were there in May, so it was chill and quiet with a beautiful cristal clean water. Nice place to snorkel. There is a sandy part but you can also stay on the rocks (where are less people) I would recommend",
          "Just went here on a sightseeing drive so did not stay too long. The cove is very remote with rocks and crystal clear waters. There are boat houses that are carved into the rocks with wooden doors on the all along the side of the cove. We came out of season so parked very close",
          "We visited the beach in early April as we have booked a villa nearby in August and wanted to check it out. You can only arrive here by car or on foot (it's a very long walk from the main road down to the beach) or if you are really lucky by boat. There seemed to be 2 parts to",
          "We came during Semana Santa and it was perfect - except for the freezing water!!!! I can imagine it's very crowded in the Summer -- it's very beautiful with crystal clear water.",
          "great place and highly recommend a visit there, there's a beach bar, cliffs to jump off into the clear water, parking is limited, we hired a quad for the day.",
          "sea food was fresh and ambience was like sitting on a terrace with lot of space so it was good.. the restaurant is on the main tourist street so you feel good to see tourists enjoying themselves in high spirits (literally)",
          "Cala Salada is very beautiful, as are most all the beaches on the west side, but a bit crowed for my pleasure. If you want to people watch and don't mind sharing your space with others then it is defiantly worth a try. It is close to Sant An which makes it convenient for those",
          "Very nice place together with the other little bach \"Cala Saladeta\", there'a good restaurant with a high quality price relation. I used to go there a lot with my daughters long ago but I'm sure it's still a good place where to go near San A. Lot of pples are jumping to the sea",
          "Cala Salada is a treasure of Saint Antoni area, city so crowded by party people. You can take a taxi from down town S.A. and it won\u00b4t cost you a fortune. This beach is very beautiful all over, first beach has a restaurant and a snack bar with friendly staff. But after snacks,",
          "The cove area is a little messy with seaweed but a beautiful place with gorgeous sea. You need to climb over rocks to get to the clean sand area. The restaurant is on the seaweed side which was lovely and friendly and had nice food and snacks. Would visit again but do prefer",
          "Great little beach, with a nice cliff restaurant. Get here early on, before sunrise if you can as the beach gets very popular . Perfect little spot for small groups, take a taxi if you can or a hire car.",
          "had an awful meal here asked for chicken salad and the chicken had been deep fried and the salad( iceberg lettuce) was swimming in grease...disgusting....the only thing to eat here is the calamari...oh and the waiters need personality bypasses",
          "Next to Cala Salada is lcated Cala Saladeta , which is the actual beach area the place is beautiful the water the sand the surrounding , everything (would be perfect , except for it is dirty, mostly cigarette butts)",
          "Excellent beach side restaurant with great views over the bay nice safe and sandy beach very popular with the locals",
          "Lovely little beach, great restaurant. Avoid in high season as the beach gets very crowded and it's a nightmare if you drive right down to the beach, as there is not much room to turn around.",
          "Absolutely amazing place. If there is Eden on the Earth I was there being in Cala Salada. Cristal clear water, very quiet place to relaxing with breathtaking views. Highly recommended place to spend time with your family and friends.",

        "wiki": "Marpessa Hennink (born 11 July 1964) is a Dutch fashion model. She is best known for her collaborations with Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHennink was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands to a Dutch mother and a Surinamese father of partial black African ancestry. She was raised by her mother, who happened to be a hippie.From as young as the age of four, Hennink expressed an interest in modeling, though she did not begin working as a model until she turned sixteen, after having been discovered by a magazine editor in her native Amsterdam. This happened despite being rejected by the Eileen Ford agency during a casting call.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAmong the first fashion designers that Hennink modeled for were Kenzo and Yohji Yamamoto. She credited the late fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez with recommending her to some of the prominent designers, such as Azzedine Alaia, and Karl Lagerfeld of the fashion house Chanel. Most notably, Hennink walked the runway for Dolce & Gabbana's first fashion show in 1985, at the beginning of their career as designers. The same year, she appeared in the music video for Bryan Ferry's song, \"Slave to Love\", directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino.\nHennink went on to walk the runway for many other designers including Versace, Christian Lacroix, Valentino, Christian Dior, Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Issey Miyake, Moschino, Claude Montana, Salvatore Ferragamo, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Lanvin, Thierry Mugler, Donna Karan, Trussardi, Mila Sch\u00f6n, Rifat \u00d6zbek, Bruce Oldfield, Ted Lapidus, and Betty Jackson. She was given the nickname \"the Catwalk Contessa\".In 1987, Hennink was chosen by Dolce & Gabbana to star in the advertising campaign for their Fall/Winter collection. It was the first campaign for the label, and Hennink agreed to do it for free. The campaign was photographed in Sicily by Ferdinando Scianna of Magnum Photos. The photographs from the campaign made such an impression that Hennink came to be seen as an icon of Mediterranean femininity.In October of that year, Hennink was named \"Model of the Year\". She was sometimes paired with model Veronica Webb in fashion shows and in magazine photo spreads. Some of the magazines that Hennink has been featured in include various international editions of Vogue, as well as other publications such as Elle, Glamour, Time, Vanity Fair, Marie Claire, L'Officiel, and Photo.\nIn 1993, Hennink retired from modeling, having been put off by the arrival of the grunge fashion trend. Upon her retirement, she moved to Ibiza, Spain, where she began a career as an interior decorator. She made a return to the fashion runways in 2004, where she closed the Fall/Winter show for designer Antonio Marras. In January 2011, Hennink was chosen to walk in a special fashion show held by designer Alberta Ferretti in Florence, Italy. Then, in May 2011, she walked in the \"Fashion for Relief\" benefit show in Cannes, France. The following year, Dolce & Gabbana launched a line of made-to-measure clothing called \"Alta Moda\", and chose Hennink as the global ambassador for that line.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHennink speaks six languages. In her spare time, she enjoys photography. She considers In\u00e8s de La Fressange, Diana Vreeland, and Madeleine Castaing as her style icons. In 2005, Hennink gave birth to a daughter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Cala d\u2019en Serra is a beach in the northern part of the Spanish island of Ibiza. It is in the municipality of Sant Joan de Labritja and is 4.3 miles (6.9 km) north of the village of Sant Joan de Labritja, and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) east of the beach  resort of Portinatx.The beach of Cala d\u2019en Serra is a small horseshoe bay with a further satellite coves near by. The sandy beach has clean clear water and was once named in The Guardian newspaper, one of Europe\u2019s best beaches. The bay is surrounded by steep cliffs.\n\n\n== The Abandoned Hotel ==\nThis building project was started in 1969 by acclaimed Catalan Architect Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, who was exiled in the United States at the time, was planned to be a luxury hotel resort complex. Sert\u2019s clerk of works, Antonio Ferran signed off on his projects back in Catalonia to get around the fact that Spain's fascist government ensured that Sert himself could not be accredited as an architect in the Catalonia & Balearic islands region. By the middle of the 1970s a lot of work had already been completed but project was put on hold, and then abandoned completely after Sert died of lung cancer in 1983.\nIn the years following Sert\u2019s death there have been many proposals and heated debates over what should be done with the half finished project. Many islanders consider the half constructed hotel a blight on an area of outstanding natural beauty while others see the project as an important piece of cultural heritage, since Sert has now been elevated to one of Catalonia's most acclaimed architects. In the year 2000 plans were drawn up to complete the complex in the style intended by Sert, for use as an exclusive tourist attraction and Thalassotherapy centre. These plans were also eventually abandoned, mainly due to the world banking crisis and the subsequent downturn in the island tourist economy.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nJosep Llu\u00eds Sert, the architect of the abandoned Hotel\n\n\n== References ==",
